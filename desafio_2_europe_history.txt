PREFACE 


This book contains little that is original. Since most aspects of the subject have 
been thoroughly worked over by previous historians, primary research was 
rarely required. The book's originality, such as it is, lies only in the selection, 
rearrangement, and presentation of the contents. The main aim was to map out a 
grid of time and space for European history and, by introducing a sufficiently 
comprehensive range of topics into the framework, to convey an impression of 
the unattainable whole. 

The academic apparatus has been kept to a minimum. There are no notes 
relating to facts and statements that can be found in any of the established works 
of reference. Among the latter, special mention must be made of my twenty-nine 
volumes of The Encyclopaedia Britannica (11th edn., 1910-11), which far 
surpasses all its successors. Endnotes are only provided to substantiate less 
familiar quotations and sources of information beyond the range of the standard 
textbooks. One should not assume that the text necessarily agrees with 
interpretations found in the works cited: 'On ne s'etonnera pas que la doctrine 
exposee dans le texte ne soit toujours d'accord avec les travaux auxquels il est 
renvoye en note. '* 

The academic considerations which underlay the writing of the present volume 
have been set out in the Introduction. But its design may need some explanation. 

The text has been constructed on several different levels. Twelve narrative 
chapters pan across the whole of Europe's past, from prehistory to the present. 
They gradually zoom in from the distant focus of Chapter I, which covers the 
first five million years, to the relatively close focus of Chapters XI and XII, 
which cover the twentieth century at roughly one page per year. Each chapter 
carries a selection of more specific 'capsules', picked out, as it were, by 
telephoto, and illustrating narrower themes that cut across the chronological 
flow. Each chapter ends with a wide-angle 'snapshot' of the whole Continent as 
seen from one particular vantage-point. The overall effect may be likened to a 
historical picture album, in which panoramic tableaux are interspersed by a 
collection of detailed insets and close-ups. One hopes it is understood that the 


degree of precision attainable at these different levels will vary considerably. 
Indeed, a work of synthesis cannot expect to match the standards of scientific 
monographs that have rather different purposes in mind. 

The twelve main chapters follow the conventional framework of European 
history. They provide the basic chronological and geographical grid into which 
all the other topics and subjects have been fitted. They concentrate on 'event- 
based history': on the principal political divisions, cultural movements, and 
socio-economic trends which enable historians to break the mass of information 
into manageable (though necessarily artificial) units. The chronological 
emphasis lies on the medieval and modern periods, where a recognizably 
European community can be seen to be operating. The geographical spread aims 
to give equitable coverage to all parts of the European Peninsula from the 
Atlantic to the Urals- north, east, west, south, and centre. 

At every stage, an attempt has been made to counteract the bias of 
'Eurocentrism' and 'Western civilization' (see Introduction, pp. 16-19,19-31). 
But in a work of this scope it has not been possible to extend the narrative 
beyond Europe's own frontiers. Suitable signals have been made to indicate the 
great importance of contingent subjects such as Islam, colonialism, or Europe 
overseas. East European affairs are given their proper prominence. Wherever 
appropriate, they are integrated into the major themes which affect the whole of 
the Continent. An eastern element is included in the exposition of topics such as 
the Barbarian invasions, the Renaissance, or the French Revolution, which all 
too often have been presented as relevant only to the West. The space given to 
the Slavs can be attributed to the fact that they form the largest of Europe's 
ethnic families. National histories are regularly summarized; but attention has 
been paid to the stateless nations, not just to the nation-states. Minority 
communities, from heretics and lepers to Jews, Romanies, and Muslims, have 
not been forgotten. 

In the last chapters, the priorities of the 'Allied scheme of history' have not 
been followed (see Introduction, pp. 39-42). Nor have they been polemically 
contested. The two World Wars have been treated as 'two successive acts of a 
single drama', preference being given to the central continental contest between 
Germany and Russia. The final chapter on post-war Europe takes the narrative to 
the events of 1989-91 and the disintegration of the Soviet Union. The argument 
contends that 1991 saw the end of a geopolitical arena, dubbed 'the Great 
Triangle', whose origins can be dated to the turn of the twentieth century (see 



Appendix III, p. 1312), and whose demise offers a suitable hiatus in a continuing 
story. The approach of the twenty-first century sees the opening of a new 
opportunity to design a new Europe. 

The capsules, of which there are some 300 (see Map 30 and Appendix I), 
perform several purposes. They draw attention to a wide variety of specifics 
which would otherwise find no place among the generalizations and 
simplifications of synthetic history-writing. They sometimes introduce topics 
which cross the boundaries of the main chapters; and they illustrate all the 
curiosities, whimsies, and inconsequential sidestreams which over-serious 
historians can often overlook. Above all, they have been selected to give as 
many glimpses as possible of The new methods, the new disciplines, and the 
new fields' of recent research. They provide samples from some sixty categories 
of knowledge, which have been distributed over the chapters in the widest 
possible scatter of period, location, and subject-matter. For arbitrary reasons of 
the book's length, the publishers' patience, and the author's stamina, the original 
capsule list had to be reduced. None the less, it is hoped that the overall 
pointilliste technique will still create an effective impression, even with a smaller 
number of points. 

Each capsule is anchored into the text at a specific point in time and space, 
and is marked by a headword that summarizes its contents. Each can be tasted as 
a separate, self-contained morsel; or it can be read in conjunction with the 
narrative into which it is inserted. 

The snapshots, of which there are twelve, are designed to present a series of 
panoramic overviews across the changing map of Europe. They freeze the frame 
of the chronological narrative, usually at moments of symbolic importance, and 
call a temporary halt to the headlong charge across enormous expanses of time 
and territory. They should help the reader to catch breath, and to take stock of the 
numerous transformations which were progressing at any one time on many 
different fronts. They are deliberately focused from a single vantage-point, and 
make no attempt to weigh the multiplicity of opinions and alternative 
perspectives which undoubtedly existed. To this extent, they are shamelessly 
subjective and impressionistic. In some instances, they border on the 
controversial realm of Taction', combining known events with undocumented 
suppositions and deductions. Like several other elements in the book, they may 
be judged to exceed the conventional bounds of academic argument and 
analysis. If so, they will draw attention not only to the rich variety of Europe's 



past but also to the rich variety of prisms through which it can be viewed. 

The book has been largely written in Oxford. It owes much to the rich and 
ancient resources of the Bodleian Library, and to that Library's rich and ancient 
standards of service. It was also helped by scholarships kindly provided by the 
Institut fur die Wissenschaften vom Menschen in Vienna and by Harvard 
University's Ukrainian Research Institute. It has been coloured by several visits 
to the mainland of Europe during its writing, notably by impressions garnered in 
Belarus and Ukraine, on the road from Bavaria to Bologna, in the French and 
Swiss Alps, in the Netherlands, in Hungary, and in the Vendee. 

I wish to acknowledge a period of one year's study leave which was granted 
by the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, University of London, on 
the condition that private funds were raised against the cost of replacement 
teaching. At other times, when leave was not granted, the book has possibly 
benefited from the discipline of writing in every sort of inspiring locale-on 
trains, in planes, in canteens, in hospital waiting-rooms, on Hawaiian beaches, 
on the back row of other people's seminars, even in a crematorium car park. I 
also acknowledge a special subsidy provided by Heinemann and Mandarin in 
order to speed the preparation of auxiliary materials. 

I wish to express my thanks to colleagues and friends who have served as 
readers for particular chapters or sections: Barry Cunliffe, Stephanie West, Riet 
van Bremen, David Morgan, David Eltis, Fania Oz-Salzburger, Mark Almond, 
and Timothy Garton Ash; to a legion of helpers and consultants including Tony

to the project manager Patrick Duffy; and especially to my wife, without whose 
support and forbearance the project could never have come to fruition. There is 
no prize for finding the black cat. 



There is strong reason to believe that European history is a valid academic 
subject, which is solidly based on past events that really happened. Europe's 
past, however, can only be recalled through fleeting glimpses, partial probes, and 
selective soundings. It can never be recovered in its entirety. This volume, 
therefore, is only one from an almost infinite number of histories of Europe that 
could be written. It is the view of one pair of eyes, filtered by one brain, and 
translated by one pen.

In preparing the corrected edition of Europe: a history, the amendments have 
been addressed solely to errors of fact, nomenclature and orthography. No 
attempt was made to re-enter the realm of historical interpretation. In addition to 
the original team of consultants, most of whom have offered a second round of 
advice, I wish to convey my special thanks to:

Map 1 The Paninsula, c. 10,000 bc 


THE LEGEND OF EUROPA 


In the beginning, there was no Europe. All there was, for five million years, was 
a long, sinuous peninsula with no name, set like the figurehead of a ship on the 
prow of the world's largest land mass. To the west lay the ocean which no one 
had crossed. To the south lay two enclosed and interlinked seas, sprinkled with 
islands, inlets, and peninsulas of their own. To the north lay the great polar 
icecap, expanding and contracting across the ages like some monstrous, freezing 
jellyfish. To the east lay the land-bridge to the rest of the world, whence all 
peoples and all civilizations were to come. 




In the intervals between the Ice Ages, the Peninsula received its first human 
settlers. The humanoids of Neanderthal, and the cave people of Cromagnon, 
must have had names and faces and ideas. But it cannot be known who they 
really were. They can only be recognized dimly from their pictures, their 
artefacts, and their bones. 

With the last retreat of the ice, only twelve thousand years ago, the Peninsula 
received new waves of migrants. Unsung pioneers and prospectors moved 
slowly out to the west, rounding the coasts, crossing the land and the seas until 
the furthest islands were reached. Their greatest surviving masterwork, as the 
Age of Stone gave way to that of Bronze, was built on the edge of human 
habitation on a remote, offshore island. But no amount of modern speculation 
can reveal for certain what inspired those master masons, nor what their great 
stone circle was called.- 

At the other end of the Peninsula, another of those distant peoples at the 
dawn of the Bronze Age was founding a community whose influence has lasted 
to the present day. By tradition the Hellenes descended from the continental 
interior in three main waves, taking control of the shores of the Aegean towards 
the end of the second millennium bc. They conquered and mingled with the 
existing inhabitants. They spread out through the thousand islands which lie 
scattered among the waters between the coasts of the Peloponnese and of Asia 
Minor. They absorbed the prevailing culture of the mainland, and the still older 
culture of Crete. Their language distinguished them from the 'barbarians'-the 
'speakers of unintelligible babble'. They were the creators of ancient Greece, 

[BARBAROS] 

Later, when children of classical times asked where humankind had come 
from, they were told about the creation of the world by an unidentified opifex 
rerurm or 'divine maker'. They were told about the Flood, and about Europa. 

Europa was the subject of one of the most venerable legends of the classical 
world. Europa was the mother of Minos, Lord of Crete, and hence the 
progenitrix of the most ancient branch of Mediterranean civilization. She was 
mentioned in passing by Homer. But in Europa and the Bulk attributed to 
Moschus of Syracuse, and above all in the Metamorphoses of the Roman poet, 
Ovid, she is immortalized as an innocent princess seduced by the Father of the 
Gods. Wandering with her maidens along the shore of her native Phoenicia, she 
was beguiled by Zeus in the guise of a snow-white bull: 

And gradually she lost her fear, and he 


Offered his breast for her virgin caresses, 

His horns for her to wind with chains of flowers, 

Until the princess dared to mount his back, 

Her pet bull's back, unwitting whom she rode. 

Then-slowly, slowly down the broad, dry beach- 

First in the shallow waves the great god set 
His spurious hooves, then sauntered further out 
Till in the open sea he bore his prize. 

Fear filled her heart as, gazing back, she saw 
The fast receding sands. Her right hand grasped 
A horn, the other lent upon his back. 

Her fluttering tunic floated in the breeze.- 

Here was the familiar legend of Europa as painted on Grecian vases, in the 
houses of Pompeii (See Plate no. 1), and in modern times by Titian, Rembrandt, 
Rubens, Veronese, and Claude Lorrain. 

The historian Herodotus, writing in the fifth century bc, was not impressed 
by the legend. In his view, the abduction of Europa was just an incident in the 
age-old wars over women-stealing. A band of Phoenicians from Tyre had carried 
off Io, daughter of the King of Argos; so a band of Greeks from Crete sailed over 
to Phoenicia and carried off the daughter of the King of Tyre. It was a case of tit 
for tit. 

The legend of Europa has many connotations. But in carrying the princess to 
Crete from the shore of Phoenicia (now south Lebanon) Zeus was surely 
transferring the fruits of the older Asian civilizations of the East to the new 
island colonies of the Aegean. Phoenicia belonged to the orbit of the Pharaohs. 
Europa's ride provides the mythical link between Ancient Egypt and Ancient 
Greece. Europa's brother Cadmus, who roamed the world in search of her, orbe 
pererrato, was credited with bringing the art of writing to Greece, [cadmus] 

Europa's ride also captures the essential restlessness of those who followed 
in her footsteps. Unlike the great river valley civilizations of the Nile, of the 
Indus, of Mesopotamia, and of China, which were long in duration but lethargic 
in their geographical and intellectual development, the civilization of the 
Mediterranean Sea was stimulated by constant movement. Movement caused 
uncertainty and insecurity. Uncertainty fed a constant ferment of ideas. 
Insecurity prompted energetic activity. Minos was famed for his ships. Crete was 


the first naval power. The ships carried people and goods and culture, fostering 
exchanges of all kinds with the lands to which they sailed. Like the vestments of 
Europa, the minds of those ancient mariners were constantly left 'fluttering in 
the breeze '-tremulae sinuantur flamine vestes.- 

Europa rode in the path of the sun from east to west. According to another 
legend, the Sun was a chariot of fire, pulled by unseen horses from their secret 
stables behind the sunrise to their resting-place beyond the sunset. Indeed, one of 
several possible etymologies contrasts Asia, 'the land of the Sunrise', with 
Europa, 'the land of the Sunset'.- The Hellenes came to use 'Europe' as a name 
for their territory to the west of the Aegean as distinct from the older lands in 
Asia Minor. 

At the dawn of European history, the known world lay to the east. The 
unknown waited in the west, in destinations still to be discovered. Europa's 
curiosity may have been her undoing. But it led to the founding of a new 
civilization that would eventually bear her name and would spread to the whole 
Peninsula.

INTRODUCTION 


History Today 

History can be written at any magnification. One can write the history of the 
universe on a single page, or the life-cycle of a mayfly in forty volumes. A very 
senior and distinguished historian, who specializes in the diplomacy of the 
1930s, once wrote a book on the Munich Crisis and its consequences (1938-9), a 
second book on The Last Week of Peace, and a third entitled 31 August 1939. His 
colleagues waited in vain for a crowning volume to be called One Minute to 
Midnight- It is an example of the modern compulsion to know more and more 
about less and less. 

The history of Europe, too, can be written at any degree of magnitude. The 
French series LEvolution de Lhumanite, whose content was over 90 percent 
European, was planned after the First World War with no main volumes and 
several supplementary ones.= The present work, in contrast, has been 
commissioned to compress the same material and more between two covers. 

Yet no historian can compete with the poets for economy of thought: 

If Europe is a Nymph, 

Then Naples is her bright-blue eye, 

And Warsaw is her heart. 

Sebastopol and Azoff, 

Petersburg, Mitau, Odessa: 

These are the thorns in her feet. 

Paris is the head, 

London the starched collar, 

And Rome-the scapulary.- 

For some reason, whilst historical monographs have become ever narrower in 
scope, general surveys have settled down to a conventional magnification of 


several hundred pages per century. The Cambridge Mediaeval History (1936- 
9),for example, covers the period from Constantine to Thomas More in eight 
volumes.- The German Handbuch der europaischen Geschichte (1968-79) 
covers the twelve centuries from Charlemagne to the Greek colonels in seven 
similarly weighty tomes.- It is common practice to give greater coverage to the 
contemporary than to the ancient or the medieval periods. For English readers, a 
pioneering collection such as Rivington's eight-volume 'Periods of European 
History' moved from the distant to the recent with ever-increasing magnification 
-442 years at the rate of 1.16 years per page for Charles Oman's Dark Ages, 
476-918 (1919), 104 years at 4.57 pages per year for A. H. Johnson's Europe in 
the Sixteenth Century (1897), 84 years at 6.59 pages per year for W. Alison 
Phillipps's Modern Europe, 1815-99 (1905).- More recent collections follow the 
same pattern. 

Most readers are most interested in the history of their own times. But not all 
historians are willing to indulge them. "'Current Affairs" cannot become 
"History" until half a century has elapsed,' runs one opinion, until 'documents 
have become available and hindsight [has] cleared men's minds.'- It is a valid 
point of view. But it means that any general survey must break off at the point 
where it starts to be most interesting. Contemporary history is vulnerable to all 
sorts of political pressure. Yet no educated adult can hope to function efficiently 
without some grounding in the origins of contemporary problems. 2 Four hundred 
years ago Sir Walter Ralegh, writing under sentence of death, understood the 
dangers perfectly. 'Whosoever in writing a modern history shall follow the Truth 
too near the heels,' he wrote, 'it may haply strike out his teeth.'- 

Given the complications, one should not be surprised to find that the subject- 
matter of studies of 'Europe' or of 'European civilization' varies enormously. 
Successful attempts to survey the whole of European history without recourse to 
multiple volumes and multiple authors have been few and far between. H. A. L. 
Fisher's A History of Europe (1936)- or Eugene Weber's A Modern History of 
Europe (1971)- are among the rare exceptions. Both of these are extended 
essays on the dubious concept of'Western civilization' (see below). Probably the 
most effective of grand surveys are those which have concentrated on one theme, 
such as Kenneth Clark's Civilisation,- which looked at Europe's past through 
the prism of art and painting, or Jacob Bronowski's The Ascent of Man (1973),- 
which made its approach through the history of science and technology. Both 
were the offshoots of opulent television productions. A more recent essay 


approached the subject from a materialistic standpoint based on geology and 
economic resources.- 

The value of multi-volume historical surveys is not in question; but they are 
condemned to remain works of reference, to be consulted, not read. Neither full¬ 
time history students nor general readers are going to plough through ten, 
twenty, or one hundred and ten volumes of general European synthesis before 
turning to the topics which attract them most. This is unfortunate. The 
framework of the whole sets parameters and assumptions which reappear 
without discussion in detailed works on the parts. 

In recent years, the urgency of reviewing the general framework of European 
history has grown in proportion to the fashion for highly specialized, high- 
magnification studies. A few distinguished exceptions, such as the work of 
Fernand Braudel,- may serve to prove the rule. But many historians and 
students have been drawn into 'more and more about less and less' to the point 
where the wider perspectives are sometimes forgotten. Yet the humanities 
require all degrees of magnification. History needs to see the equivalent of the 
planets spinning in space; to zoom in and observe people at ground level, and to 
dig deep beneath their skins and their feet. The historian needs to use 
counterparts of the telescope, the microscope, the brain-scanner, and the 
geological probe. 

It is beyond dispute that the study of history has been greatly enriched in recent 
years by new methods, new disciplines, and new fields. The advent of computers 
has opened up a whole range of quantitative investigations hitherto beyond the 
historian's reach, [rentes] Historical research has greatly benefited from the use 
of techniques and concepts derived from the social and human sciences, [aricia] 

[CEDROS] [CHASSE] [CONDOM] [EPIC] [FIESTA] [GENES] [GOTTHARD] [LEONARDO] 
[LIETUVA] [NOVGOROD] [PLOVUM] [PROPAGANDA] [SAMPHIRE] [VENDANGE.] A trend 

pioneered by the French Annales school from 1929 onwards has now won 
almost universal acclaim, [annales] New academic fields such as oral history, 
historical psychiatry (or 'psycho-history'), or family history, or the history of 
manners, are now well established, [bogey] [mores] [sound] [zadruga] At the 
same time, a number of subjects reflecting contemporary concerns have been 
given a fresh historical dimension. Anti-racism, environment, gender, sex, 
Semitism, class, and peace are topics which occupy a sizeable part of current 
writing and debate. Notwithstanding the overtones of 'political correctness', all 


serve to enrich the whole, [black athena] [caucasia] [eco] [femme] [nobel] 

[POGROM][SPARTACUS] 

None the less, the multiplication of fields, and the corresponding increase in 
learned publications, have inevitably created severe strains. Professional 
historians despair of 'keeping up with the literature'. They are tempted to plunge 
ever deeper into the alleyways of ultra-specialization, and to lose the capacity of 
communicating with the general public. Much specialization has proceeded to 
the detriment of narrative history. Some specialists have worked on the 
assumption that the broad outlines need no revision: that the only route to new 
discovery lies in digging deep on a narrow front. Others, intent on the 
exploration of 'deep structures', have turned their backs on 'the surface' of 
history altogether. They concentrate instead on the analysis of 'long-term, 
underlying trends'. Like some of their confreres in literary criticism, who hold 
the literal meaning of a text to be worthless, some historians have seen fit to 
abandon the study of conventional 'facts'. They produce students who have no 
intention of learning what happened how, where, and when. 

The decline of factual history has been accompanied, especially in the 
classroom, with the rise of 'empathy', that is, of exercises designed to stimulate 
the historical imagination. Imagination is undoubtedly a vital ingredient of 
historical study. But empathetic exercises can only be justified if accompanied 
by a modicum of knowledge. In a world where fictional literature is also under 
threat as a respectable source of historical information, students are sometimes in 
danger of having nothing but their teacher's prejudices on which to build an 
awareness of the past. - 

The divorce between history and literature has been particularly regrettable. 
When the 'structuralists' in the humanities were overtaken in some parts of the 
profession by the 'deconstructionists', both historians and literary critics looked 
set not only to exclude all conventional knowledge but also to exclude each 
other. Fortunately, as the wilder aspects of deconstructionism are deconstructed, 
there are hopes that these esoteric rifts can be healed.- There is absolutely no 
reason why the judicious historian should not use literary texts, critically 

assessed, or why literary critics should not use historical knowledge, 
[GATTOPARDO] [KONARMYA] 

It would now seem, therefore, that the specialists may have overplayed their 
hand. There has always been a fair division of labour between the industrious 
worker bees of the historical profession and the queen bees, the grands 
simplifica-teurs, who bring order to the labours of the hive. There will be no 


honey if the workers take over completely. Nor can one accept that the broad 
oudines of'general history' have been fixed for all time. They too shift according 
to fashion: and those fixed fifty or one hundred years ago are ripe for revision 
(see below). Equally, the study of the geological strata of history must never be 
divorced from doings on the ground. In the search for 'trends', 'societies', 
'economies', or 'cultures', one should not lose sight of men, women, and 
children. 

Specialization has opened the door to unscrupulous political interests. Since 
no one is judged competent to offer an opinion beyond their own particular 
mine-shaft, beasts of prey have been left to prowl across the prairie unchecked. 
The combination of solid documentary research harnessed to blatantly selective 
topics, which a priori exclude a full review of all relevant factors, is specially 
vicious. As A. J. P. Taylor is reputed to have said of one such work, 'it is ninety 
per cent true and one hundred per cent useless'.- 

The prudent response to these developments is to argue for pluralism of 
interpretation and for 'safety in numbers': that is, to encourage a wide variety of 
special views in order to counter the limitations of each and every one. One 
single viewpoint is risky. But fifty or sixty viewpoints-or three hundred-can 
together be counted on to construct a passable composite. 'There is no one Truth, 
but as many truths as there are sensitivities. '- 

In Chapter II, below, mention is made of Archimedes' famous solution of the 
problem of n, that is, of calculating the ratio of a circle's circumference to its 
diameter. Archimedes knew that the length of the circumference must lie 
somewhere between the sum of the sides of a square drawn outside the circle and 
the sum of the sides of a square drawn inside the circle (see diagram). Unable to 
work it out directly, he hit on the idea of finding an approximation by adding up 
the length of a 99-sided polygon contained within the circle. The more sides he 
gave to his polygon, the nearer it would come to the shape of the circle. 
Similarly, one is tempted to think, the larger the number of sources of 
illumination, the smaller the gap will be between past reality and historians' 
attempts to reconstmct it. 

Elsewhere, the impossible task of the historian has been likened to that of a 
photographer, whose static two-dimensional picture can never deliver an 
accurate representation of the mobile, three-dimensional world. 'The historian, 
like the camera, always lies.'- If this simile were to be developed, one could say 
that photographers can greatly increase the verisimilitude of their work-where 


verisimilitude is the aim-by multiplying the number of pictures of the same 
subject. A large number of shots taken from different angles, and with different 
lenses, filters, and films, can collectively reduce the gross selectivity of the 
single shot. As movie-makers discovered, a large number of frames taken in 
sequence creates a passable imitation of time and motion. By the same token, 
'history in the round' can only be reconstructed if the historian collates the 
results of the widest possible range of sources. The effect will never be perfect; 
but every different angle and every different technique contributes to the 
illumination of the parts which together make up the whole. 

Distortion is a necessary characteristic of all sources of information. 
Absolute objectivity is absolutely unattainable. Every technique has its strengths 
and its weaknesses. The important thing is to understand where the value and the 
distortions of each technique lie, and to arrive at a reasonable approximation. 
Critics who object to the historian's use of poetry, or sociology or astrology, or 
whatever, on the grounds that such sources are 'subjective' or 'partial' or 
'unscientific', are stating the obvious. It is as though one could object to X-ray 
pictures of the skeleton, or ultra-sound scans of the womb, on the grounds that 
they give a pretty poor image of the human face. Medical doctors use every 
known device for prying open the secrets of the human mind and body. 
Historians need a similar range of equipment for penetrating the mysteries of the 
past. 

Documentary history, which has enjoyed a long innings, is simultaneously 
one of the most valuable and the most risky lines of approach. Treated with 
incaution, it is open to gross forms of misrepresentation; and there are huge areas 
of past experience which it is incapable of recording. Yet no one can deny that 

historical documents remain one of the most fruitful veins of knowledge, 
[HOSSBACH] [METRYKA] [SMOLENSK] 

Lord Acton, founder of the Cambridge school of history, once predicted a 
specially deleterious effect of documentary history. It tends to give priority to the 
amassing of evidence over the historian's interpretation of evidence. [We live] 
'in a documentary age,' Acton wrote some ninety years ago, 'which will tend to 
make history independent of historians, to develop learning at the expense of 
writing.'- 

Generally speaking, historians have given more thought to their own debates 
than to the problems encountered by their long-suffering readers. The pursuit of 
scientific objectivity has done much to reduce earlier flights of fancy, and to 


separate fact from fiction. At the same time it has reduced the number of 
instruments which historians can use to transmit their discoveries. For it is not 
sufficient for the good historian merely to establish the facts and to muster the 
evidence. The other half of the task is to penetrate the readers' minds, to do 
battle with all the distorting perceptors with which every consumer of history is 
equipped. These perceptors include not only all five physical senses but also a 
complex of pre-set intellectual circuits, varying from linguistic terminology, 
geographical names, and symbolic codes to political opinions, social 
conventions, emotional disposition, religious beliefs, visual memory, and 
traditional historical knowledge. Every consumer of history has a store of 
previous experience through which all incoming information about the past must 
be filtered. 

For this reason, effective historians must devote as much care to transmitting 
their information as to collecting and shaping it. In this part of their work, they 
share many of the same preoccupations as poets, writers, and artists. They must 
keep an eye on the work of all the others who help to mould and to transmit our 
impressions of the past-the art historians, the musicologists, the museologues, 
the archivists, the illustrators, the cartographers, the diarists and biographers, the 
sound-recordists, the film-makers, the historical novelists, even the purveyors of 
'bottled medieval air'. At every stage the key quality, as first defined by Vico, is 
that of 'creative historical imagination'. Without it, the work of the historian 
remains a dead letter, an unbroadcast message, [prado] [sonata] [sovkino] 

In this supposedly scientific age, the imaginative side of the historical profession 
has undoubtedly been downgraded. The value of unreadable academic papers 
and of undigested research data is exaggerated. Imaginative historians such as 
Thomas Carlyle, have not simply been censured for an excess of poetic licence. 
They have been forgotten. Yet Carlyle's convictions on the relationship of 
history and poetry are at least worthy of consideration.- It is important to check 
and to verify, as Carlyle sometimes failed to do. But 'telling it right' is also 
important. All historians must tell their tale convincingly, or be ignored. 

'Postmodernism' has been a pastime in recent years for all those who give 
precedence to the study of historians over the study of the past. It refers to a 
fashion which has followed in the steps of the two French gurus, Foucault and 
Derrida, and which has attacked both the accepted canon of historical knowledge 
and the principles of conventional methodology. In one line of approach, it has 


sought to demolish the value of documentary source materials in the way that 
literary deconstructionists have sought to dismantle the 'meaning' of literary 
texts. Elsewhere it has denounced 'the tyranny of facts' and the 'authoritarian 
ideologies' which are thought to lurk behind every body of information. At the 
extreme, it holds that all statements about past reality are 'coercive'. And the 
purveyors of that coercion include all historians who argue for 'a commitment to 
human values'. In the eyes of its critics, it has reduced history to 'the pleasure of 
the historian'; and it has become an instrument for politicized radicals with an 
agenda of their own. In its contempt for prescribed data, it hints that knowing 
something is more dangerous than knowing nothing.- 

Yet the phenomenon has raised more problems than it solves. Its enthusiasts 
can only be likened to those lugubrious academics who, instead of telling jokes, 
write learned tomes on the analysis of humour. One also wonders whether 
conventional liberal historiography can properly be defined as 'modernist'; and 
whether 'post-modernist' ought not to be reserved for those who are trying to 
strike a balance between the old and the new. It is all very well to deride the 
authority of all and sundry; but it only leads in the end to the deriding of Derrida. 
It is only a matter of time before the deconstructionists are deconstructed by 
their own techniques. 'We have survived the "Death of God" and the "Death of 
Man". We will surely survive "the Death of History" ... and the death of 
postmodernism.'- 

But to return to the question of magnification. Any narrative which chronicles 
the march of history over long periods is bound to be differently designed from 
the panorama which co-ordinates all the features relevant to a particular stage or 
moment. The former, chronological approach has to emphasize innovative 
events and movements which, though untypical at the time of their first 
appearance, will gain prominence at a later date. The latter, synchronic approach 
has to combine both the innovative and the traditional, and their interactions. 
The first risks anachronism, the second immobility. 

Early modern Europe has served as one of the laboratories for these 
problems. Once dominated by historians exploring the roots of humanism, 
protestantism, capitalism, science, and the nation-state, it then attracted the 
attention of specialists who showed, quite correctly, how elements of the 
medieval and pagan worlds had survived and thrived. The comprehensive 
historian must somehow strike a balance between the two. In describing the 
sixteenth century, for example, it is as misguided to write exclusively about 


witches, alchemists, and fairies as it once was to write almost exclusively about 
Luther, Copernicus, or the rise of the English Parliament. Comprehensive history 
must take note of the specialists' debate, but it must equally find a way to rise 
above their passing concerns. 

Concepts of Europe 

'Europe' is a relatively modern idea. It gradually replaced the earlier concept of 
'Christendom' in a complex intellectual process lasting from the fourteenth to 
the eighteenth centuries. The decisive period, however, was reached in the 
decades on either side of 1700 after generations of religious conflict. In that 
early phase of the Enlightenment (see Chapter VIII) it became an embarrassment 
for the divided community of nations to be reminded of their common Christian 
identity; and 'Europe' filled the need for a designation with more neutral 
connotations. In the West, the wars against Louis XIV inspired a number of 
publicists who appealed for common action to settle the divisions of the day. The 
much-imprisoned Quaker William Penn (1644-1718), son of an Anglo-Dutch 
marriage and founder of Pennsylvania, had the distinction of advocating both 
universal toleration and a European parliament. The dissident French abbe, 
Charles Castel de St Pierre (1658-1743), author of Projet d'une paix perpetuelle 
(1713), called for a confederation of European powers to guarantee a lasting 
peace. In the East, the emergence of the Russian Empire under Peter the Great 
required radical rethinking of the international framework. The Treaty of Utrecht 
of 1713 provided the last major occasion when public reference to the 
Respublica Christiana, the 'Christian Commonwealth', was made. 

After that, the awareness of a European as opposed to a Christian community 
gained the upper hand. Writing in 1751, Voltaire described Europe as: 

a kind of great republic divided into several states, some monarchical, the others mixed... but all 
corresponding with one another. They all have the same religious foundation, even if divided into several 
confessions. They all have the same principle of public law and politics, unknown in other parts of the 
world.- 


Twenty years later, Rousseau announced: 'There are no longer Frenchmen, 
Germans, and Spaniards, or even English, but only Europeans.' According to one 
judgement, the final realization of the 'idea of Europe' took place in 1796, when 
Edmund Burke wrote: 'No European can be a complete exile in any part of 


Europe.'- Even so, the geographical, cultural, and political parameters of the 
European community have always remained open to debate. In 1794, when 
William Blake published one of his most unintelligible poems entitled 'Europe: 
A Prophecy', he illustrated it with a picture of the Almighty leaning out of the 
heavens and holding a pair of compasses.- 

Most of Europe's outline is determined by its extensive sea-coasts. But the 
delineation of its land frontier was long in the making. The dividing line between 
Europe and Asia had been fixed by the ancients from the Hellespont to the River 
Don, and it was still there in medieval times. A fourteenth-century encyclopedist 
could produce a fairly precise definition: 

'Europe is said to be a third of the whole world, and has its name from Europa, daughter of Agenor, King of 
Libya. Jupiter ravished this Europa, and brought her to Crete, and called most of the land after her Europa... 
Europe begins on the river Tanay [Don] and stretches along the Northern Ocean to the end of Spain. The 
east and south part rises from the sea called Pontus [Black Sea] and is all joined to the Great Sea [the 
Mediterranean] and ends at the islands of Cadiz [Gibraltar]...'- 


Pope Pius II (Enea Piccolomini) began his early Treatise on the State of Europe 
(1458) with a description of Hungary, Transylvania, and Thrace, which at that 
juncture were under threat from the Turks. 

Neither the ancients nor the medievals had any close knowledge of the 
easterly reaches of the European Plain, several sections of which were not 
permanently settled until the eighteenth century. So it was not until 1730 that a 
Swedish officer in the Russian service called Strahlenberg suggested that 
Europe's boundary should be pushed back from the Don to the Ural Mountains 
and the Ural River. Sometime in the late eighteenth century, the Russian 
government erected a boundary post on the trail between Yekaterinburg and 
Tyumen to mark the frontier of Europe and Asia. From then on the gangs of 
Tsarist exiles, who were marched to Siberia in irons, created the custom of 
kneeling by the post and of scooping up a last handful of European earth. 'There 
is no other boundary post in the whole world', wrote one observer, 'which has 
seen ... so many broken hearts.'- By 1833, when Volger's Handbuch der 
Geographie was published, the idea of'Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals' 
had gained general acceptance.- 

None the less, there is nothing sacred about the reigning convention. The 
extension of Europe to the Urals was accepted as a result of the rise of the 
Russian Empire. But it has been widely criticized, especially by analytical 
geographers. The frontier on the Urals had little validity in the eyes of Halford 


Mackinder, of Arnold Toynbee, for whom environmental factors had primacy, or 
of the Swiss geographer, J. Reynold, who wrote that 'Russia is the geographical 
antithesis of Europe'. The decline of Russian power could well invoke a revision 
-in which case the views of a Russian-born Oxford professor about a 'tidal 
Europe', whose frontiers ebb and flow, would be borne out.- 

Geographical Europe has always had to compete with notions of Europe as a 
cultural community, and in the absence of common political structures, European 
civilization could only be defined by cultural criteria. Special emphasis is 
usually placed on the seminal role of Christianity, a role which did not cease 
when the label of Christendom was dropped. 

Broadcasting to a defeated Germany in 1945, the poet T. S. Eliot expounded 
the view that European civilization stands in mortal peril after repeated dilutions 
of the Christian core. He described 'the closing of Europe's mental frontiers' that 
had occurred during the years which had seen the nation-states assert themselves 
to the full. 'A kind of cultural autarchy followed inevitably on political and 
economic autarchy,' he said. He stressed the organic nature of culture: 'Culture is 
something that must grow. You cannot build a tree; you can only plant it, and 
care for it, and wait for it to mature ... ' He stressed the interdependence of the 
numerous sub-cultures within the European family. What he called cultural 
'trade' was the organism's lifeblood. And he stressed the special duty of men of 
letters. Above all, he stressed the centrality of the Christian tradition, which 
subsumes within itself'the legacy of Greece, of Rome, and of Israel': 

'The dominant feature in creating a common culture between peoples, each of which has its own distinct 
culture, is religion.... I am talking about the common tradition of Christianity which has made Europe what 
it is, and about the common cultural elements which this common Christianity has brought with it It is in 
Christianity that our arts have developed; it is in Christianity that the laws of Europe-until recently-have 
been rooted. It is against a background of Christianity that all our thought has significance. An individual 
European may not believe that the Christian Faith is true; and yet what he says, and makes, and does, will 
all... depend on [the Christian heritage] for its meaning. Only a Christian culture could have produced a 
Voltaire or a Nietzsche. I do not believe that the culture of Europe could survive the complete disappearance 
of the Christian Faith.'- 


This concept is, in all senses, the traditional one. It is the yardstick of all other 
variants, breakaways, and bright ideas on the subject. It is the starting-point of 
what Mme de Stael once called 'penser a I'europeenne'. 

For cultural historians of Europe, the most fundamental of tasks is to identify 
the many competing strands within the Christian tradition and to gauge their 


weight in relation to various non-Christian and anti-Christian elements. 
Pluralism is de rigueur. Despite the apparent supremacy of Christian belief right 
up to the mid-twentieth century, it is impossible to deny that many of the most 
fruitful stimuli of modern times, from the Renaissance passion for antiquity to 
the Romantics' obsession with Nature, were essentially pagan in character. 
Similarly, it is hard to argue that the contemporary cults of modernism, 
eroticism, economics, sport, or pop culture have much to do with the Christian 
heritage. The main problem nowadays is to decide whether the centrifugal forces 
of the twentieth century have reduced that heritage to a meaningless jumble or 
not. Few analysts would now maintain that anything resembling a European 
cultural monolith has ever existed. One interesting solution is to see Europe's 
cultural legacy as composed of four or five overlapping and interlocking 
circles- (see Appendix III, p. 1238). According to the novelist Alberto Moravia, 
Europe's unique cultural identity is 'a reversible fabric, one side variegated ... 
the other a single colour rich and deep'.- 

It would be wrong to suppose, however, that 'Europe' was devoid of political 
content. On the contrary, it has often been taken as a synonym for the harmony 
and unity which was lacking. 'Europe' has been the unattainable ideal, the goal 
for which all good Europeans are supposed to strive. 

This messianic or Utopian view of Europe can be observed as far back as the 
discussion which preceded the Treaty of Westphalia. It was loudly invoked in the 
propaganda of William of Orange and his allies, who organized the coalitions 
against Louis XIV, as in those who opposed Napoleon. 'Europe', said Tsar 
Alexander I, 'is us.' It was present in the rhetoric of the Balance of Power in the 
eighteenth century, and of the Concert in the nineteenth. It was an essential 
feature of the peaceful Age of Imperialism which, until shattered by the Great 
War of 1914, saw Europe as the home base of worldwide dominion. 

In the twentieth century, the European ideal has been revived by politicians 
determined to heal the wounds of two world wars. In the 1920s, after the First 
World War, when it could be propagated in all parts of the continent outside the 
Soviet Union, it found expression in the League of Nations and particularly in 
the work of Aristide Briand (see pp. 949-51). It was specially attractive to the 
new states of Eastern Europe, who were not encumbered by extra-European 
empires and who sought communal protection against the great powers. In the 
late 1940s, after the creation of the Iron Curtain, it was appropriated by people 
who were intent on building a Little Europe in the West, who imagined their 


construction as a series of concentric circles focused on France and Germany. 
But it equally served as a beacon of hope for others cut off by oppressive 
communist rule in the East (see p. 13 below). The collapse of the Soviet empire 
in 1989-91 offered the first glimpses of a pan-European community that could 
aspire to spread to all parts of the continent. 

Yet the frailty of the European ideal has been recognized both by its 
opponents and by its advocates. In 1876 Bismarck dismissed Europe, as 
Metternich had once dismissed Italy, as 'a geographical notion'. Seventy years 
later Jean Monnet, 'the Father of Europe', saw the force of Bismarck's disdain. 
'Europe has never existed,' he admitted; 'one has genuinely to create Europe.'- 

For more than five hundred years the cardinal problem in defining Europe has 
centred on the inclusion or exclusion of Russia. Throughout modern history, an 
Orthodox, autocratic, economically backward but expanding Russia has been a 
bad fit. Russia's Western neighbours have often sought reasons for excluding 
her. Russians themselves have never been sure whether they wanted to be in or 
out. 

In 1517, for example, the Rector of the Jagiellonian University in Cracow, 
Maciej Miechowita, published a geographical treatise which upheld the 
traditional Ptolemeian distinction between Sarmatia europaea (European 
Sarmatia) and Sarmatia asiatica (Asian Sarmatia) with the boundary on the Don. 
So Poland-Lithuania was in and Russian Muscovy was out.- Three centuries 
later, things were not so clear. Poland-Lithuania had just been dismembered, and 
Russia's frontier had shifted dramatically westwards. When the Frenchman 
Louis-Philippe de Segur (1753-1830) passed by on the eve of the French 
Revolution, he was in no doubt that Poland no longer lay in Europe. 'On croit 
sortir entierement de l'Europe,' he wrote after entering Poland; 'tout ferait 
penser qu'on a recule de dix siecles.' (One believes oneself to be leaving Europe 
completely; everything might give the impression of retreating ten centuries in 
time.) By using economic advancement as the main criterion for European 
membership, he was absolutely up to date.- 

Yet this was exactly the era when the Russian government was insisting on 
its European credentials. Notwithstanding the fact that her territory stretched in 
unbroken line through Asia to North America, the Empress Catherine 
categorically announced in 1767 that 'Russia is a European state'. Everyone who 
wished to do business with St Petersburg took note. After all, Muscovy had been 


an integral part of Christendom since the tenth century, and the Russian Empire 
was a valued member of the diplomatic round. Fears of the 'Bear' did not 
prevent the growth of a general consensus regarding Russia's membership of 
Europe. This was greatly strengthened in the nineteenth century by Russia's role 
in the defeat of Napoleon, and by the magnificent flowering of Russian culture 
in the age of Tolstoy, Tchaikovsky, and Chekov. 

Russian intellectuals, divided between Westernizers and Slavophiles, were 
uncertain about the degree of Russia's Europeanness (see Chapter X, pp. 811- 
12, 817). In Russia and Europe (1871), the Slavophile Nikolay Danilevskiy 
(1822-85) argued that Russia possessed a distinctive Slavic civilization of its 
own, midway between Europe and Asia. Dostoevsky, in contrast, speaking at the 
unveiling of a statue to the poet Pushkin, chose to launch into a eulogy of 
Europe. 'Peoples of Europe', he declared, They don't know how dear to us they 
are.' Only the small group of vostochniki or 'orientals' held that Russia was 
entirely un-European, having most in common with China.- 

After 1917 the conduct of the Bolsheviks revived many of the old doubts and 
ambiguities. The Bolsheviks were widely regarded abroad as barbarians-in 
Churchill's words, 'a baboonery'-a gang of wild Asiatics sowing death and 
destruction like Attila or Genghis Khan. In Soviet Russia itself, the Marxist 
revolutionaries were often denounced as a Western implant, dominated by Jews, 
backed by Western money, and manipulated by German Intelligence. At the 
same time, a strong line of official opinion held that the Revolution had severed 
all links with 'decadent' Europe. Many Russians felt humiliated by their 
isolation, and boasted that a revitalized Russia would soon overwhelm the 
faithless West. Early in 1918, the leading Russian poet of the revolutionary years 
wrote a defiant poem entitled 'The Scythians': 

You're millions; we are hosts and hosts and hosts. 

Engage with us and prove our seed! 

We're Scythians and Asians, too, from coasts 
That breed squint eyes, bespeaking greed. 

Russia's a Sphinx! Triumphant though in pain 
She bathes her limbs in blood's dark stream. 

Her eyes gaze on you-gaze and gaze again- 

With hate and love in a single beam. 

Old world-once more-awake! Your brothers' plight 


To toil and peace, a feast of fire. 

Once more! Come join your brothers' festal light! 

Obey the call of Barbar's lyre.- 

Not for the first time, the Russians were torn in two directions at once. 

As for the Bolshevik leadership, Lenin and his circle identified closely with 
Europe. They saw themselves as heirs to a tradition launched by the French 
Revolution; they saw their immediate roots in the socialist movement in 
Germany, and they assumed that their strategy would be to join up with 
revolutions in the advanced capitalist countries of the West. In the early 1920s, 
Comintern mooted the possibility of a (communist-led) United States of Europe. 
Only under Stalin, who killed all the old Bolsheviks, did the Soviet Union 
choose to distance itself spiritually from European affairs. In those same 
decades, an influential group of emigre Russian intellectuals including Prince N. 
S. Trubetskoy, P. N. Savitsky, and G. Vernadsky, chose to re-emphasize the 
Asiatic factors within Russia's cultural mix. Known as Yevraziytsy or 
'Eurasians', they were fundamentally opposed to Bolshevism, whilst 
maintaining a sceptical stance to the virtues of Western Europe. 

Of course, seventy years of totalitarian Soviet rule built huge mental as well 
as physical curtains across Europe. The public face of the Soviet regime grew 
blatantly xenophobic-a posture greatly assisted by experiences during the 
Second World War, and assiduously cultivated by the Stalinists. In their hearts, 
however, many individual Russians followed the great majority of non-Russians 
in the Soviet Bloc in fostering a heightened sense of their European identity. It 
was a lifeline for their spiritual survival against communism. When the chains of 
communism melted away, it enabled them to greet, in Vaclav Havel's phrase, 
'the Return to Europe'. 

None the less, scepticism about Russia's European qualifications continued 
to circulate both inside and outside Russia. Russian nationalist opinion, which 
heartily dislikes and envies 'the West', supplied a rallying-point for the Stalinist 
apparatus, which felt humiliated by the collapse of Soviet power and which 
wanted nothing more than to get its empire back. As the core of opposition to 
hopes for a post-communist democracy, the unholy alliance of Russian 
nationalists and unreformed communists could only look askance at Moscow's 
growing rapprochement with Washington and with Western Europe. 

For their part, Western leaders were most impressed by the need for stability. 


Having failed to find a lasting partnership with Gorbachev's humanized version 
of the USSR, they rushed headlong to shore up the Russian Federation. They 
responded sympathetically to Moscow's requests for economic aid and for 
association both with NATO and with the European Community. But then some 
of them began to see the drawbacks. After all, the Russian Federation was not a 
cohesive nation-state, ripe for liberal democracy. It was still a multinational 
complex spanning Eurasia, still highly militarized, and still manifesting imperial 
reflexes about its security. It was not clearly committed to letting its neighbours 
follow their own road. Unless it could find ways of shedding the imperialist 
legacy, like all other ex-imperial states in Europe, it could not expect to be 
considered a suitable candidate for any European community. Such at least was 
the strong opinion of the doyen of the European Parliament, speaking in 
September 1993. [eesti] 

Some commentators have insisted that Britain's European credentials are no 
less ambiguous than Russia's. From the Norman Conquest to the Hundred Years 
War, the kingdom of England was deeply embroiled in Continental affairs. But 
for most of modern history the English sought their fortunes elsewhere. Having 
subdued and absorbed their neighbours in the British Isles, they sailed away to 
create an empire overseas. Like the Russians, they were definitely Europeans, 
but with prime extra-European interests. They were, in fact, semi-detached. 
Their habit of looking on The Continent' as if from a great distance did not start 
to wane until their empire disappeared. What is more, the imperial experience 
had taught them to look on Europe in terms of 'great powers', mainly in the 
West, and 'small nations', mainly in the East, which did not really count. Among 
the sculptures surrounding the Albert Memorial (1876) in London is a group of 
figures symbolizing 'Europe'. It consists of only four figures-Britain, 
Germany, France, and Italy. For all these reasons, historians have often regarded 
Britain as 'a special case'.- The initiators of the first pan-European movement 
in the 1920s (see pp. 944,1065) assumed that neither Britain nor Russia would 
join. 

In the mean time, a variety of attempts have been made to define Europe's 
cultural subdivisions. In the late nineteenth century, the concept of a German- 
dominated Mitteleuropa was launched to coincide with the political sphere of the 
Central Powers. In the inter-war years, a domain called 'East Central Europe' 
was invented to coincide with the newly independent 'successor states'-from 
Finland and Poland to Yugoslavia. This was revived again after 1945 as a 
convenient label for the similar set of nominally independent countries which 


were caught inside the Soviet bloc. By that time the main division, between a 
'Western Europe' dominated by NATO and the EEC and an 'Eastern Europe' 
dominated by Soviet communism seemed to be set in stone. In the 1980s a group 
of writers led by the Czech novelist, Milan Kundera, launched a new version of 
'Central Europe', to break down the reigning barriers. Here was yet another 
configuration, another true 'kingdom of the spirit'.- 

The 'Heart of Europe' is an attractive idea which possesses both 
geographical and emotional connotations. But it is peculiarly elusive. One author 
has placed it in Belgium, another in Poland, a third in Bohemia, a fourth in 
Hungary, and a fifth in the realm of German literature.- Wherever it is, the 
British Prime Minister declared in 1991 that he intended to be there. For those 
who think that the heart lies in the dead centre, it is located either in the 
commune of St Clement (Allier), the dead centre of the European Community, or 
else at a point variously calculated to lie in the suburbs of Warsaw or in the 
depths of Lithuania, the dead centre of geographical Europe. 

During the seventy-five years when Europe was divided by the longest of its 
civil wars, the concept of European unity could only be kept alive by people of 
the widest cultural and historical horizons. Especially during the forty years of 
the Cold War, it took the greatest intellectual courage and stamina to resist not 
only persistent nationalism but also the parochial view of a Europe based 
exclusively on the prosperous West. Fortunately, a few individuals of the 
necessary stature did exist, and have left their legacy in writings which will soon 
be sounding prophetic. 

One such person was Hugh Seton-Watson (1916-84), elder son of the 
pioneer of East European studies in Britain, R. W. Seton-Watson (1879-1951). 
As a boy he played at the knee of Thomas Masaryk; he spoke Serbo-Croat, 
Hungarian, and Romanian as effortlessly as French, German, and Italian. Born in 
London, where he became Professor of Russian History at the School of 
Slavonic and East European Studies, he usually described himself as a Scot. He 
never succumbed to the conventional wisdom of his day. He set out his testament 
on the concept of Europe in a paper published posthumously. His argument 
stressed three fundamental points-the need for a European ideal, the 
complementary role of the East and the West European nations, and the 
pluralism of Europe's cultural tradition. Each deserves a quotation of some 
length. 


Seton-Watson's first thunderbolt was directed at the low horizons of those 
who expected European unity to be built on nothing more than the security 
interests of NATO or the economic interests of the EEC: 


Let us not underrate the need for a positive common cause, for something more exciting than the price of 
butter, more constructive than the allocation of defence contracts-a need for an European mystique.- 

The second shaft was directed at those who sought to exclude the East 
Europeans in the name of Western civilization: 

The European cultural community includes the peoples living beyond Germany and Italy... something in no 
way annulled by the fact that they cannot today belong to an all-European economic or political community 
... Nowhere in the world is there so widespread a belief in the reality, and the importance, of a European 
cultural community, as in the countries lying between the EEC and the Soviet Union... To these peoples, 
the idea of Europe is that of a community of cultures to which the specific culture or sub-culture of each 
belongs. None of them can survive without Europe, or Europe without them. This is of course a myth... a 
sort of chemical compound of truth and fantasy. The absurdities of the fantasy need not obscure the truth.- 

The third shaft was aimed at those who harbour a simplistic or monolithic 
view of European culture: 


The interweaving of the notions of Europe and of Christendom is a fact of History which even the most 
brilliant sophistry cannot undo... But it is no less true that there are strands in European culture that are not 
Christian: the Roman, the Hellenic, arguably the Persian, and (in modern centuries) the Jewish. Whether 
there is also a Muslim strand is more difficult to say.- 

The conclusion defines the purpose and value of European culture: 

[European culture] is not an instrument of capitalism or socialism; it is not a 
monopoly possession of EEC Eurocrats or of anyone else. To owe allegiance to 
it, is not to claim superiority over other cultures... The unity of European culture 
is simply the end-product of 3000 years of labour by our diverse ancestors. It is a 
heritage which we spurn at our peril, and of which it would be a crime to deprive 
younger and future generations. Rather it is our task to preserve and renew it.- 

Seton-Watson was one of a select band of lonely runners who carried the 
torch of European unity through the long night of Europe's eclipse. He was one 
of the minority of Western scholars who bestrode the barriers between East and 
West, and who saw Soviet communism for what it was. He died on the eve of the 
events which were to vindicate so many of his judgements. His intellectual 
legacy is the one which the present work is honoured to follow most closely.- 


The writing of European history could not proceed until the concept of Europe 
had stabilized and the historian's art had assumed an analytical turn. But it was 


certainly well under way in the early decades of the nineteenth century. The 
earliest effective attempt at synthesis was by the French writer and statesman 
Francois Guizot (1787-1874). His Histoire de la cvilisation en Europe (1828- 
30) was based on lectures presented at the Sorbonne. 

Thanks to the problems of definition, most historians would agree that the 
subject-matter of European history must concentrate on the shared experiences 
which are to be found in each of the great epochs of Europe's past. Most would 
also agree that it was in late antiquity that European history ceased to be an 
assortment of unrelated events within the given Peninsula and began to take on 
the characteristics of a more coherent civilizational process. Central to this 
process was the merging of the classical and the barbarian worlds, and the 
resultant assertion of a consciously Christian community-in other words, the 
founding of Christendom. Later on, all manner of schisms, rebellions, 
expansions, evolutions, and fissiparities took place, giving rise to the 
exceedingly diverse and pluralistic phenomenon which is Europe today. No two 
lists of the main constituents of European civilization would ever coincide. But 
many items have always featured prominently: from the roots of the Christian 
world in Greece, Rome, and Judaism to modern phenomena such as the 
Enlightenment, modernization, romanticism, nationalism, liberalism, 
imperialism, totalitarianism. Nor should one forget the sorry catalogue of wars, 
conflicts, and persecutions that have dogged every stage of the tale. Perhaps the 
most apposite analogy is the musical one. European historians are not tracing the 
story of a simple libretto. They are out to recapture a complicated score, with all 
its cacophony of sounds and its own inimitable codes of communication: 
'Europe ... has been likened to an orchestra. There are certain moments when 
certain of the instruments play a minor role, or even fall silent altogether. But the 
ensemble exists.'- There is much to be said also for the contention that Europe's 
musical language has provided one of the most universal strands of the European 
tradition, [mousike] 

None the less, since Europe has never been politically united, diversity has 
evidently provided one of its most enduring characteristics. Diversity can be 
observed in the great range of reactions to each of the shared experiences. There 
is lasting diversity in the national states and cultures which persist within 
European civilization as a whole. There is diversity in the varying rhythms of 
power and of decline. Guizot, the pioneer, was not alone in thinking of diversity 
as Europe's prime characteristic. 


Eurocentrism 


European history-writing cannot be accused of Eurocentrism simply for focusing 
its attention on European affairs, that is, for keeping to the subject. Eurocentrism 
is a matter of attitude, not content. It refers to the traditional tendency of 
European authors to regard their civilization as superior and self-contained, and 
to neglect the need for taking non-European viewpoints into consideration. Nor 
is it surprising or regrettable to find that European history has mainly been 
written by Europeans and for Europeans. Everybody feels the urge to discover 
their roots. Unfortunately, European historians have frequently approached their 
subject as Narcissus approached the pool, looking only for a reflection of his 
own beauty. Guizot has had many imitators since he identified European 
civilization with the wishes of the Almighty. 'European civilisation has entered 
... into the eternal truth, into the plan of Providence,' he reflected. 'It progresses 
according to the intentions of God.'- For him, and for many like him, Europe 
was the promised land and Europeans the chosen people. 

Many historians have continued in the same self-congratulatory vein, and 
have argued, often quite explicitly, that the European record provides a model 
for all other peoples to follow. Until recently, they paid scant regard to the 
interaction of European culture with that of its neighbours in Africa, India, or 
Islam. A prominent American scholar, writing in 1898, who traced European 
civilization primarily to the work of 'Teutonic tribes', took it as axiomatic that 
Europe was the universal model: 

The heirs of the ancient world were the Teutonic tribes, who ... gradually 
formed a new uniform civilisation on the foundation of the classic, and in recent 
times this has begun to be worldwide and to bring into close relationship and 
under common influences all the inhabitants of the earth.- 

When Oxford University Press last dared to publish a one-volume History of 
Europe, the authors opened their preface with a similar choice sentiment: 

Although a number of grand civilisations have existed in various ages, it is the 
civilisation of Europe which has made the deepest and widest impression, and 
which now (as developed on both sides of the Atlantic) sets the standard for all 
the peoples of the earth.- 


This line of thought and mode of presentation has steadily been losing its 
attractions, especially for non-Europeans. 

Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936) is sometimes regarded as a central figure of 
the Eurocentric tradition, even as 'an apologist for the civilizing mission of 
British colonial expansion'. His famous Ballad of East and West was composed 
with India in mind: 

Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet 
Till Earth and Sky stand presently at God's great Judgement Seat. 

But there is neither East nor West, Border, Breed nor Birth, 

When two strong men stand face to face, though they come from the ends 
of the Earth.- 

Kipling shared little of the arrogance which was usually associated with the 
European attitudes of his day. He did not shrink from the phraseology of his day 
concerning our 'dominion over palm and pine' or 'the lesser breeds without the 
Law'. Yet he was strongly attracted to Indian culture-hence his wonderful 
Jungle Books -and he was a deeply religious and humble man: 

The tumult and the shouting dies- 

The captains and the kings depart- 

Still stands Thine ancient sacrifice, 

An humble and a contrite heart. 

Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet, 

Lest we forget, lest we forget.- 

These words are a standing rebuke to anyone who would lump all 'Western 
imperialists' into the same gang of arrogants. 

Opposition to Eurocentrism comes at present from four main sources. In 
North America it has emerged from that part of the Black community, and their 
political sympathizers, who are rebelling against an educational system allegedly 
dominated by 'white supremacist values', in other words by the glorification of 
European culture. It has found expression in the Black Muslim movement and, 
in scholarship, in a variety of Black studies (Afrology) directed against 
conventional American academia.- In its most militant form, it aims to replace 
Eurocentrism with Afrocentricity-'the belief in the centrality of Africans in 


post-modern history'.- This is based on the contention that European 
civilization has 'stolen' the birthright of mankind, and of Africans in particular.- 
In the world of Islam, especially in Iran, similar opposition is mounted by 
religious fundamentalists, who see 'the West' as the domain of Satan. Elsewhere 
in the Third World, it is espoused by intellectuals, often of a Marxian 
complexion, who regard Eurocentric views as part and parcel of capitalist 
ideology.- In Europe it is widespread, though not always well articulated, in a 
generation which, when they paused to think, have been thoroughly ashamed of 
many of their elders' attitudes. 



One way forward for historians will be to pay more attention to the 
interaction of European and non-European peoples, [goncalvez] Another is to 
use non-European sources for the elucidation of European problems, [rus 5 ] A 
third is to insist on honest comparisons with Europe's neighbours-comparisons 
which in many aspects and instances will not be in Europe's favour. Above all, it 
is essential to modulate the tone. For the last hundred years the conduct of those 
'Teutonic tribes', and of other Europeans, has not been much to boast of. 

In the end, like all human activities, the European record must be judged on 





































its own merits. It cannot be fairly represented in a list of'Great Books', which 
selects whatever is most genial and ignores the dross (see below). It can be 
viewed with admiration or with disgust, or with a mixture of both. The opinion 
of one Frenchman strikes an optimistic note: 'After all, crime and western 
history are not the same thing. Whatever [the West] has given to the world by far 
exceeds that which it has done against various societies and individuals.'- Not 
everyone would agree. 

Western Civilization 

For the best part of 200 years European history has frequently been confused 
with the heritage of'Western civilization'. Indeed, the impression has been 
created that everything 'Western' is civilized, and that everything civilized is 
Western. By extension, or simply by default, anything vaguely Eastern or 
'Oriental' stands to be considered backward or inferior, and hence worthy of 
neglect. The workings of this syndrome have been ably exposed with regard to 
European attitudes towards Islam and the Arab world, that is, in the tradition of 
so-called 'Orientalism'.- But it is not difficult to demonstrate that it operates 
with equal force in relation to some of Europe's own regions, especially in the 
East. Generally speaking, Western civilization is not taken to extend to the whole 
of Europe (although it may be applied to distant parts of the globe far beyond 
Europe). 

Historians most given to thinking of themselves as from 'the West'-notably 
from England, France, Germany, and North America-rarely see any necessity 
to describe Europe's past in its entirety. They see no more reason to consider the 
countries of Eastern Europe than to dwell on the more westerly parts of Western 
Europe. Any number of titles could be cited which masquerade as histories of 
'Europe', or of'Christendom', but which are nothing of the sort. Any number of 
surveys of'Western civilization' confine themselves to topics which relate only 
to their chosen fragments of the Peninsula. In many such works there is no 
Portugal, no Ireland, Scotland or Wales, and no Scandinavia, just as there is no 
Poland, no Hungary, no Bohemia, no Byzantium, no Balkans, no Baltic States, 
no Byelorussia or Ukraine, no Crimea or Caucasus. There is sometimes a Russia, 
and sometimes not. Whatever Western civilization is, therefore, it does not 
involve an honest attempt to summarize European history. Whatever 'the West' 
is, it is not just a synonym for Western Europe.- This is a very strange 


phenomenon. It seems to assume that historians of Europe can conduct 
themselves like the cheese-makers of Gruyere, whose product contains as many 
holes as cheese. 

Examples are legion; but three or four must suffice. A History of Mediaeval 
Europe, written by a distinguished Oxford tutor, has long served as a standard 
introduction to the subject. Readers of the preface may be surprised to learn, 
therefore, that the contents do not coincide with the tide: 

In the hope of maintaining a continuity of theme... I have probably been guilty of oversimplifying things... 
The history of mediaeval Byzantium is so different from that of western Europe in its whole tone and tenor 
that it seemed wiser not to attempt any systematic survey of it; in any case, I am not qualified to undertake 
such a survey. I have said nothing about the history of mediaeval Russia, which is remote from the themes 
which I have chosen to pursue; and I have probably said less than I should have done about Spain.- 

The subject, in fact, is defined as 'western Europe (Latin Christendom), the 
terms being more or less analogous'.- One might then think that all would be 
well if the book were to receive a tide to match its contents. 'A History of 
Medieval Western Europe' or 'A History of Latin Christendom in the Middle 
Ages' might seem appropriate. But then one finds that the text makes little 
attempt to address all the parts even of Latin Christendom. Neither Ireland nor 
Wales, for example, find mention. The realm of the Jagiellons in Poland and 
Lithuania, which in the latter part of the chosen period was absolutely the largest 
state in Latin Christendom, merits two passing references. One relates to the 
policies of the German Emperor Otto III, the other to the plight of the Teutonic 
Knights. The huge, multinational kingdom of Hungary, which stretched from the 
Adriatic to Transylvania, gains much less attention than Byzantium and the 
Greeks, which the author has put a priori out of bounds. The book has many 
virtues; but, like very many others, what it amounts to is a survey of selected 
themes from favoured sectors of one part of Europe. 

A highly influential Handbook to the History of Western Civilization is 
organized within a similar strange framework. The largest of its three parts, 
'European Civilization (cad 900-Present)', starts with 'The Geographical Setting 
of European Civilization', and explains how 'the transitions from Oriental to 
Classical and from Classical to European civilizations each time involved a shift 
to the periphery of the older society'. The 'original homeland of European 
Civilization' is described in terms of a plain 'extending from the Pyrenees... into 
Russia', and separated from 'the Mediterranean lands' by an 'irregular mountain 
barrier'. But there is no attempt in subsequent chapters to map out the history of 


this homeland. The former lands of the Roman Empire 'came to be divided 
between three civilizations-Islam, Orthodox Christianity, and Latin 
Christianity'. But no systematic treatment of this threefold division in Europe is 
forthcoming. One sentence is awarded to pagan Scandinavia, and none to any of 
the other pagan lands which were later christianized. There is a small subsection 
on 'The Peoples of Western Europe' in early times (p. 129), including 
unspecified 'Indo-European tribesmen', but none on the peoples of Eastern 
Europe in any period. There are scattered references to 'Slavic' or 'Slavic¬ 
speaking' peoples, but no indication that they represented the largest of Europe's 
Indo-European groups. There are major chapters on 'Western Christendom 900- 
1500'; but no chapter appears on Eastern Christendom. The paragraphs on 'The 
Expansion of Europe' refer either to German colonization or to ocean voyages 
outside Europe. Two sentences suddenly inform the reader that Western 
Christendom in the fourteenth century actually included 'Scandinavia, the Baltic 
States, Poland, Lithuania, and Hungar' (p. 345). But no further details are given. 
The largest of all the chapters, 'The Modern World, 1500-Present', deals 
exclusively with themes shorn of their eastern element until Russia, and Russia 
alone, appears ready-made under Peter the Great From then on, Russia has 
apparently been a fully qualified member of the West. The author apologizes in 
advance for his 'arbitrary principles of ordering and selection' (p. xviii). 
Unfortunately, he does not reveal what they are.- 

The 'Great Books Scheme' is another product of the same Chicago School. It 
purports to list the key authors and works that are essential for an understanding 
of Western civilization. It was invented at Columbia University in 1921, used 
from 1930 at Chicago, and became the model for university courses throughout 
America. No one would expect such a list to give exact parity to all the regions 
and cultures of Europe. But the prejudices and preferences are manifest. Of the 
151 authors on the amended list, 49 are English or American, 27 French, 20 
German, 15 Classical Greek, 9 Classical Latin, 6 Russian, 4 Scandinavian, 3 
Spanish, 3 early Italian, 3 Irish, 3 Scots, and 3 East European (see Appendix III, 
p. 1230).- 

Political theorists often betray the same bias. It is very common, for 
example, to classify European nationalism in terms of two contrasting types 
-'Eastern' and 'Western'. A prominent Oxford scholar, who stressed the 
cultural roots of nationalism, explained his version of the scheme: 


What I call eastern nationalism has flourished among the Slavs as well as in Africa and Asia, and... also in 


Latin America. I could not call it non-European and have thought it best to call it eastern because it first 
appeared to the east of Western Europe.- 

He then elucidated his view of Western nationalism by reference to the Germans 
and the Italians, whom he took, by the time of the onset of nationalism in the late 
eighteenth century, to have been 'well equipped culturally': 

They had languages adapted to the ... consciously progressive civilisation to which they belonged. They 
had universities and schools imparting the skills prized in that civilisation. They had... philosophers, 
scientists, artists and poets... of'world' reputation. They had legal, medical and other professions with high 
professional standards... To put themselves on a level with the English and the French, they had little need 
to equip themselves culturally by appropriating what was alien to them ... Their most urgent need, so it 
seemed to them, was to acquire national states of their own... 

The case with the Slavs, and later with the Africans and the Asians, has been quite different.- 

It would be difficult to invent a more cock-eyed comment on the geography and 
chronology of Europe's cultural history. The analysis of 'the Slavs', it turns out, 
is evidenced exclusively by points relating to Czechs, Slovaks, Slovenes, Serbs, 
and Croats. Nothing is said about the three largest Slav nations, the Russians, 
Ukrainians, and Poles, whose experiences flatly contradict the analysis. Who, 
what, and where, one wonders, did Professor Plamenatz imagine the Slavs to be? 
Is Eastern Europe inhabited only by Slavs? Did the Poles or the Czechs or the 
Serbs not feel an urgent need to acquire a state? Did not Polish develop as a 
language of government and of high culture before German did? Did the 
universities of Prague (1348) and Cracow (1364) belong to the 'East'? Was 
Copernicus educated in Oxford? 

As it happens, there is much to be said for a typology of nationalism which is 
based on varying rates of cultural development and on the differing correlations 
of nationality and statehood. But there is nothing to be said for giving it the 
labels of 'Eastern' and 'Western'. If one does, one finds that the best candidate 
for a nationalism of the Eastern type is to be found in the far west of Western 
Europe, in Ireland. As everyone knows, the Irish are typical products of Eastern 
Europe (see Chapter X, pp. 820-1, 829-31). 

By questioning the framework within which European history and culture is so 
frequently discussed, therefore, one does not necessarily query the excellence of 
the material presented. The purpose is simply to enquire why the framework 
should be so strangely designed. If textbooks of human anatomy were designed 
with the same attention to structure, one would be contemplating a creature with 


one lobe to its brain, one eye, one arm, one lung, and one leg. 

The chronology of the subject is also instructive. The idea of'the West' is as 
old as the Greeks, who saw Free Hellas as the antithesis of the Persian-ruled 
despotisms to the East. In modern times, it has been adopted by a long 
succession of political interests who wished to reinforce their identity and to 
dissociate themselves from their neighbours. As a result, 'Western civilization' 
has been given layer upon layer of meanings and connotations that have accrued 
over the centuries. There are a dozen or so main variants: 

The Roman Empire, which stretched far beyond the European Peninsula, 
none the less left a lasting impression on Europe's development. To this 
day, there is a clear distinction between those countries, such as France or 
Spain, which once formed an integral part of the Empire, and those, such 
as Poland or Sweden, which the Romans never reached. In this context, 

'the West' came to be associated with those parts of Europe which can 
claim a share in the Roman legacy, as distinct from those which can not. 
(See Map 3.) 

Christian utilization, whose main base settled down in Europe, was 
defined from the seventh century onwards by the religious frontier with 
Islam (see Chapter IV). Christendom was the West, Islam the East. 

The Catholic world was built on the divergent traditions of the Roman 
and the Greek churches, especially after the Schism of 1054, and on the 
use of Latin as a universal language. In this version, the West was 
equivalent to Catholicism, where the frequent divorce of ecclesiastical 
and secular authority facilitated the rise of successive non-conformist 
movements, notably the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Scientific 
Revolution, and the Enlightenment (see Chapter VII). None of these key 
movements made an early impact on the Orthodox world. 

Protestantism gave Western civilization a new focus in the cluster of 
countries in northern Europe, which broke away from Catholic control in 
the sixteenth century. The dramatic decline of major Catholic powers 
such as Spain or Poland was accompanied by the rise of the United 
Provinces, England, Sweden, and later Prussia, where naval or military 
pre-eminence was underpinned by economic and technological prowess. 

The French variant of Western civilization gained prominence in the 
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It found expression in the secular 



philosophy of the Enlightenment and in the ideals of the Revolution of 
1789-both of which have had a lasting influence. The French language 
was adopted by the educated elites of Germany and Eastern Europe, 
making French still more universal than the earlier reign of Latin. 

The imperial variant of Western civilization was based on the unbounded 
self-confidence of the leading imperial powers during the long European 
Peace prior to 1914. It was fired by a belief in the God-given right of the 
'imperial races' to rule over others, and in their supposedly superior 
cultural, economic, and constitutional development. Germany, England, 
and France were the clear leaders, whose prejudices could be impressed 
on the rest. Other major empire-owners, such as Portugal or the 
Netherlands, were minor players within Europe. Russia and Austria were 
impressive imperial powers, but fell short on other qualifications. For the 
rich imperial club in the West was marked by its advanced industrial 
economies and sophisticated systems of administration; the East by 
peasant societies, stateless nations, and raw autocracy. The Marxist 
variant was a mirror image of the imperial one. Marx and Engels 
accepted the premiss that the imperialist countries of Western Europe had 
reached a superior level of development; but they believed that the 
precocity of the West would result in early decadence and revolution. 
Their opinions carried little weight in their own day, but for a time gained 
greatly in importance thanks to the unexpected adoption of Marxism- 
Leninism as the official ideology of the Soviet empire. 

The first German variant of Western civilization was encouraged by the 
onset of the First World War. It was predicated on German control of 
Mitteleuropa (Central Europe), especially Austria, on hopes for the 
military defeat of France and Russia, and on future greatness to be shared 
with the Anglo-Saxon powers. Its advocates harboured no doubts about 
Germany's civilizing mission in Eastern Europe, whilst their rivalry with 
France, and their rejection of liberalism and 'the ideas of 1789', led to a 
distinction between Abendlich (Occidental) and Westlich (Western) 
civilization. The political formulation of the scheme was most closely 
associated with Friedrich Naumann. Its demise was assured by 
Germany's defeat in 1918, and was mourned in Spengler's Der 
Untergang des Abendlandes (1918-22). In the sphere of secular culture, 
the ethos of Mitteleuropa owed much to the influx of a strong Jewish 



element, which had turned its back on the East and whose assimilation 
into German life and language coincided with the peak of Germany's 
imperial ambitions.- [wiener welt] 

The WASP * variant of Western civilization came to fruition through the 
common interests of the USA and the British Empire as revealed during 
the First World War. It was predicated on the anglophile tendencies of 
America's then elite, on the shared traditions of Protestantism, 
parliamentary government, and the common law; on opposition to 
German hegemony in Europe; on the prospect of a special strategic 
partnership; and on the primacy of the English language, which was now 
set to become the principal means of international communication. 
Despite American contempt for the traditional forms of imperialism, it 
assumed that the USA was the equal of Europe's imperial powers. Its 
most obvious cultural monuments are to be found in the 'Great Books 
Scheme' (1921) and in the takeover of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Its 
strategic implications were formulated, among others, by the 'father of 
geopolitics', Sir Halford Mackinder,- and found early expression in the 
Washington Conference of 1922. It was revived at full strength after the 
USA's return to Europe in 1941 and the sealing of the Grand Alliance. It 
was global in scope and 'mid-Atlantic' in focus. It inevitably faded after 
the collapse of the British Empire and the rise of American interests in 
the Pacific; but it left Britain with a 'special relationship', that helped 
NATO and hindered European unification; and it inspired a characteristic 
'Allied Scheme of History' which has held sway for the rest of the 
twentieth century (see below). 

The second German variant, as conceived by the Nazis, revived many 
features of the first but added some of its own. To the original military 
and strategic considerations, it added 'Aryan' racism, Greater German 
nationalism, pagan mythology, and anti-Bolshevism. It underlay 
Germany's second bid for supremacy in Europe, which began in 1933 
and ended in the ruins of 1945. It specifically excluded the Jews. 

The American variant of Western civilization coalesced after the Second 
World War, around a constellation of countries which accepted the 
leadership of the USA and which paid court to American ideas of 
democracy and capitalism. It grew from the older Anglo-Saxon variant, 
but has outgrown its European origins. It is no longer dependent either on 


WASP supremacy in American society or on Britain's pivotal role as 
America's agent in Europe. Indeed, its centre of gravity soon moved 
from the mid-Atlantic to 'the Pacific Rim'. In addition to NATO 
members in Western Europe, it is supported by countries as 'Western' as 
Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Australia, South Africa, and Israel, 
even Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia. Through forty years of the Cold 
War, it was fired by perceptions of the worldwide threat of communism. 
One wonders how long it can continue to call itself'the West'. 

The Euro-variant of Western civilization emerged in the late 1940s, 
amidst efforts to forge a new (West) European Community. It was 
predicated on the existence of the Iron Curtain, on Franco-German 
reconciliation, on the rejection of overseas empires, on the material 
prosperity of the EEC, and on the desire to limit the influence of the 
'Anglo-Saxons'. It looked back to Charlemagne, and forward to a federal 
Europe united under the leadership of its founding members. So long as 
the community confined its principal activities to the economic sphere, it 
was not incompatible with the Americans' alternative vision of the West 
or with American-led NATO, which provided its defence. But the 
accession of the United Kingdom, the collapse of the Iron Curtain, plans 
for closer political and monetary union, and the prospect of membership 
spreading eastwards all combined to cause a profound crisis both of 
identity and of intent. 

From all these examples it appears that Western civilization is essentially an 
amalgam of intellectual constructs which were designed to further the interests 
of their authors. It is the product of complex exercises in ideology, of countless 
identity trips, of sophisticated essays in cultural propaganda. It can be defined by 
its advocates in almost any way that they think fit. Its elastic geography has been 
inspired by the distribution of religions, by the demands of liberalism and of 
imperialism, by the unequal progress of modernization, by the divisive effects of 
world wars and of the Russian Revolution, and by the self-centred visions of 
French philosopher of Prussian historians, and of British and American 
statesmen and educators, all of whom have had their reasons to neglect or to 
despise 'the East'. In its latest phase it has been immensely strengthened by the 
physical division of Europe, which lasted from 1947-8 to 1991. On the brink of 
the twenty-first century, one is entitled to ask in whose interests it may be used 
in the future. 



A set of assumptions recurs time and again. The first maintains that West and 
East, however defined, have little or nothing in common. The second implies 
that the division of Europe is justified by natural, unbridgeable differences; the 
third that the West is superior; the fourth that the West alone deserves the name 
of Europe. The geographical assumptions are abetted by selective constructs of a 
more overtly political nature. Every variant of Western civilization is taken to 
have an important core and a less important periphery. Great powers can always 
command attention. Failing powers, lesser states, stateless nations, minor 
cultures, weak economies do not have to be considered even if they occupy a 
large part of the overall scene. 

Four mechanisms have been employed to achieve the necessary effect. By a 
process of reduction, one can compress European history into a tale which 
illustrates the origins of themes most relevant to present concerns. By 
elimination, one can remove all contradictory material. By anachronism, one can 
present the facts in categories which suggest that present groupings are 
permanent fixtures of the historical scene. By the emphases and enthusiasms of 
language, one can indicate what is to be praised and what deplored. These are 
the normal mechanisms of propaganda. They devalue the diversity and the 
shifting patterns of European history, they rule out interpretations suggested by 
the full historical record; and they turn their unwitting readers into a mutual 
admiration society. 

Anachronism is particularly insidious. By taking transient contemporary 
divisions, such as the Iron Curtain, as a standing definition of'West' or 'East 5 , 
one is bound to distort any description of Europe in earlier periods. Poland is 
neatly excised from the Renaissance, Hungary from the Reformation, Bohemia 
from industrialization, Greece from the Ottoman experience. More seriously, one 
deprives a large part of Europe of its true historical personality, with 
immeasurable consequences in the miscalculations of diplomats, business 
people, and academics. 

As for the products of European history, which the propagandists of Western 
civilization are most eager to emphasize, everyone's list would vary. In the late 
twentieth century many would like to point to religious toleration, human rights, 
democratic government, the rule of law, the scientific tradition, social 
modernization, cultural pluralism, a free market economy and the supreme 
Christian virtues such as compassion, charity, and respect for the individual. 
How far these things are truly representative of Europe's past is a matter for 



debate. It would not be difficult to draw up a matching list which starts with 
religious persecution and ends with totalitarian contempt for human life. 

If mainstream claims to European supremacy have undoubtedly come out of 
the West, it should not be forgotten that there has been no shortage of 
counterclaims from the East. Just as Germany once reacted against the French 
Enlightenment, so the Orthodox Church, the Russian Empire, the pan-Slav 
movement, and the Soviet Union have all reacted against the more powerful 
West, producing theories which claim the truth and future for themselves. They 
have repeatedly maintained that, although the West may well be rich and 
powerful, the East is free from moral and ideological corruption. 

In the final years of communist rule in Eastern Europe, dissident intellectuals 
produced their own variation on this theme. They drew a fundamental distinction 
between the political regimes of the Soviet bloc and the convictions of the 
people. They felt themselves less infected by the mindless materialism of the 
West, and argued that communist oppression had strengthened their attachment 
to Europe's traditional culture. They looked forward to a time when, in a 
reunited Europe, they could trade their 'Europeanness 5 for Western food and 
technology. Here was yet another exercise in wishful thinking. 

In determining the difference between Western Civilization and European 
History, it is no easy task to sift reality from illusion. Having discovered where 
the distortions of Western civilization come from, the historian has to put 
something in their place. The answer would seem to lie in the goal of 
comprehensiveness, that is, to write of Europe north, east, west, and south; to 
keep all aspects of human life in mind; to describe the admirable, the deplorable, 
and the banal. 

None the less no historian could deny that there are many real and important 
lines on the map which have helped to divide Europe into 'West' and 'East'. 
Probably the most durable is the line between Catholic (Latin) Christianity and 
Orthodox (Greek) Christianity. It has been in place since the earliest centuries of 
our era. As shown by events during the collapse of Yugoslavia, it could still be a 
powerful factor in the affairs of the 1990s. But there are many others. There is 
the line of the Roman limes, dividing Europe into one area with a Roman past 
and another area without it. There is the line between the western Roman Empire 
and the eastern Roman Empire. In more modern times there is the Ottoman line, 
which marked off the Balkan lands which lived for centuries under Muslim rule. 



Most recently, until 1989, there was the Iron Curtain (see Map 3). 

Less certainly, social scientists invent divisions based on the criteria of their 
own disciplines. Economic historians, for example, see a line separating the 
industrialized countries of the West from the peasant societies of the East, [cap- 
ag] Historical anthropologists have identified a Leningrad-Trieste line, which 
supposedly separates the zone of nuclear families from that of the extended 
family, [zadruga] Legal historians trace a line separating the lands which 
adopted forms of Roman law and those which did not. Constitutional historians 
emphasize the line dividing countries with a liberal, democratic tradition from 
those without. As mentioned above, political scientists have found a line 
dividing 'Western' and 'non-Western' forms of nationalism.- 

All these lines, real and imagined, have profoundly affected the framework 
within which European history has been conceived and written. Their influence 
is so strong that some commentators can talk disparagingly of a 'White Europe' 
in the West and a 'Black Europe' in the East. The division of Europe into two 
opposing halves, therefore, is not entirely fanciful. Yet one has to insist that the 
West-East division has never been fixed or permanent. Moreover, it rides 
roughshod over many other lines of division of equal importance. It ignores 
serious differences both within the West and within the East; and it ignores the 
strong and historic division between North and South. Any competent historian 
or geographer taking the full range of factors into consideration can only 
conclude that Europe should be divided, not into two regions, but into five or 
six. 

Similarly, no competent historian is going to deny that Europe in its various 
guises has always possessed a central core and a series of expanding peripheries. 
European peoples have migrated far and wide, and one could argue in a very real 
sense that Europe's periphery lies along a line joining San Francisco with 
Buenos Aires, Cape Town, Sydney, and Vladivostok. Yet, once again, there can 
be no simple definition of what the core consists of. Different disciplines give 
different analyses. They have based their findings on the geographical Peninsula 
of Europe; on the ethnic heritage of the European branch of the Indo-European 
peoples; on the cultural legacy of Christendom; on the political community 
which grew from 'the Concert of Europe'; or, in the hands of the economists, on 
the growth of a world economy. 

For the purposes of comprehensive treatment, however, the important thing 
about all these definitions is that each and every one contains a variety of 


regional aspects. Wherever or whatever the core is taken to be, it is linked to the 
Ebro, the Danube, and the Volga as well as the Rhone and the Rhine; to the 
Baltic and the Black Seas as well as the Atlantic and the Mediterranean; to the 
Baits and the Slavs as well as the Germanics and the Celts; to the Greeks as well 
as the Latins; to the peasantry as well as the proletariat. Despite their differences, 
all the regions of Europe hold a very great deal in common. They are inhabited 
by peoples of predominantly Indo-European culture and related kin. They are co¬ 
heirs of Christendom. They are connected by every sort of political, economic, 
and cultural overlap and interaction. Despite their own antagonisms, they share 
fears and anxieties about influences from outside-whether from America, from 
Africa, or from Asia. Their fundamental unities are no less obvious than their 
manifest diversity. 

Western supremacy is one of those dogmas which holds good at some points 
in European history and not at others. It does not apply in the earlier centuries, 
when, for example, Byzantium was far more advanced than the empire of 
Charlemagne (which explains why Byzantium is often passed over). It has 
applied in many domains in recent times, when the West has clearly been richer 
and more powerful than the East. Yet as many would argue, the criminal conduct 
of Westerners in the twentieth century has destroyed the moral basis to all former 
claims. 

The title of 'Europe', like the earlier label of 'Christendom 5 , therefore, can 
hardly be arrogated by one of its several regions. Eastern Europe is no less 
European for being poor, or undeveloped, or ruled by tyrants. In many ways, 
thanks to its deprivations, it has become more European, more attached to the 
values which affluent Westerners can take for granted. Nor can Eastern Europe 
be rejected because it is 'different'. All European countries are different. All 
West European countries are different. And there are important similarities which 
span the divide. A country like Poland might be very different from Germany or 
from Britain; but the Polish experience is much closer to that of Ireland or of 
Spain than many West European countries are to each other. A country like 
Greece, which some people have thought to be Western by virtue of Homer and 
Aristotle, was admitted to the European Community, but its formative 
experiences in modern times were in the Orthodox world under Ottoman rule. 
They were considerably more distant from those of Western Europe than several 
countries who found themselves on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain. 

The really vicious quality shared by almost all accounts of'Western 



civilization' lies in the fact that they present idealized, and hence essentially 
false, pictures of past reality. They extract everything that might be judged genial 
or impressive; and they filter out anything that might appear mundane or 
repulsive. It is bad enough that they attribute all the positive things to the 'West', 
and denigrate the 'East'. But they do not even give an honest account of the 
West: judging from some of the textbooks, one gets the distinct impression that 
everyone in the 'West' was a genius, a philosopher, a pioneer, a democrat, or a 
saint, that it was a world inhabited exclusively by Platos and Marie Curies. Such 
hagiography is no longer credible. The established canon of European Culture is 
desperately in need of revision. Overblown talk about 'Western civilization' 
threatens to render the European legacy, which has much to be said in its favour, 
disreputable. 

In the United States the debate about Western civilization has centred on the 
changing requirements of American education. In recent years, it seems to have 
been driven by the needs of a multiethnic and multicultural society, and by 
concern for Americans whose origins lie neither in Europe nor in Europe's 
Christian-based culture. Generally speaking, it has not re-examined the picture 
of the European heritage as marketed by the likes of the 'Great Books Scheme'; 
and it has not been disturbed by demands from Americans of European descent 
for a fairer introduction to Europe. Where courses on Western civilization have 
been abandoned, they have been rejected for their alleged Eurocentrism, not for 
their limited vision of Europe. In very many cases, they have been replaced by 
courses on world history, which is judged better suited to America's 
contemporary understanding of the 'West'. 

One well-publicized reaction against the shortcomings of'Western 
civilization' was to abolish it. Stanford University in California took the lead in 
1989, instituting a 'Culture, Ideas and Values' course in place of the former 
foundation course in 'Western Culture' that had hitherto been compulsory for all 
freshpersons. According to reports, the university authorities surrendered to 
chants of'Hey-ho, Hey-ho, Western Culture has to go!' Readings in Virgil, 
Cicero, Tacitus, Dante, Luther, Aquinas, More, Galileo, Locke, and Mill were 
replaced by excerpts from Rigoberta Manchu, Frantz Fanon, Juan Rulfo, Sandra 
Cisneros, and Zora Neale Hurston (none of whom suffered the stigma of being 
'Dead White European Males'). - This event was excessively satirized. Stanford 
can take some pride from seeing a problem and trying to tackle it. The trouble is 


that the cure may prove worse than the malady. In theory, there is much to be 
said for introducing 'mul-ticulturalism' and 'ethnic diversity' into American 
academe. It is unfortunate that there is no known Tibetan Tacitus, no African 
Aquinas, no Mexican Mill for students to study. Indeed, there is nothing very 
much in any of the recorded non-European cultures that might illustrate the roots 
of America's supposedly liberal traditions.- 

At the time of the furore over Stanford's program on Western Culture, its 
parallel courses on European History escaped the spotlight. But they were cast in 
the same mould. The choice of 39 set readings for the program in 'Europe I, II, 
and III', for example, revealed a brand of selectivity with far-reaching 
implications. Apart from Joseph Conrad (Korzeniowski), there was no single 
author from Eastern Europe. (Conrad was included for his novels about Africa, 
such as Heart of Darkness, not for his writings on Eastern Europe.) Apart from 
Matthew Arnold, there was no single author with any sort of connection with the 
Celtic world. (Arnold was included as English critic and poet, not as Professor of 
Celtic Literature.) There was no single Italian author more modern than 
Baldassare Castiglione, who died in 1528. There was one novelist from South 
Africa, but no one from Ireland, no one from Scandinavia, no one but Germans 
from central Europe, no one from the Balkan countries, no one from Russia. 
Most curiously, from a history department, there was no historical text more 
modern than one from Herodotus.- 

To be fair, selection is always necessary, always difficult, and always 
unsatisfactory: Stanford's quandary is not unique. But the particular form of 
selection practised by one of the world's most expensive seats of learning is 
indicative of wider concerns. It purports to introduce 'Europe', but introduces 
only a small corner of the European continent. It purports to introduce 'the 
Western Heritage'-the title of its textbook-but it leaves much of the West 
untouched. It purports to give emphasis to Europe's 'literary and philosophical 
aspects', but emphasises only a partial slice of European culture. It mentions 
neither Joyce nor Yeats, neither Andersen, Ibsen, nor Kirkegaard, neither Kafka, 
Koestler, nor Kundera, neither Solzhenitzyn nor even Dostoevsky. No Trades 
Description Act could ever sanction a product whose list of ingredients lacked so 
many of the basic items. 

No zoo can contain all the animals. But, equally, no self-respecting collection 
can confine itself to monkeys, vultures, or snakes. No impartial zoologist could 
possibly approve of a reptile house which masquerades as a safari park and 


which contains only twelve crocodiles (of both sexes), eleven lizards, one dodo, 
and fifteen sloths. In any case, Stanford was hardly alone. By 1991, the National 
Endowment for the Humanities was quoted with an assessment that students 
could graduate from 78 per cent of US colleges and universities without ever 
taking a course in Western civilization.- One suspects, in fact, that the problem 
lies less in the subject-matter of European studies than in the outlook of those 
who present them. Many American courses, like the Great Books Scheme, were 
directed at a particular generation of young Americans, who were desperately 
eager to learn a simplified version of the lost heritage of their immigrant 
forebears. Nowadays, they obviously need to be modified to match a new 
generation, with different perceptions. Readings about Europe might arouse less 
resentment if they were laced with some of its less savoury aspects. Intelligent 
students can always sense when something is concealed, when they are not 
expected to understand, but to admire. 

Some of America's minorities may indeed have a case for contesting 
Eurocentrism. If so, America's majority, who are overwhelmingly European in 
their origins, may choose to challenge 'Western civilization' on other grounds. 
Many of America's most numerous communities-Irish, Spanish, Polish, 
Ukrainian, Italian, Greek, Jewish-came from regions of Europe which find 
little place in existing surveys of 'Western civilization'; and they have every 
reason to expect an improvement. 

The great paradox of contemporary American intellectual life, however, lies 
in the fact that the virtues most prized by the American version of Western 
civilization-tolerance, freedom of thought, cultural pluralism-now seem to be 
under attack from the very people who have benefited from them most. Critics 
have observed 'the Closing of the American Mind'.- Self-styled 'liberals' have 
been shown to be pursuing an 'Illiberal Education'.- Sixty years on, the author 
of the Great Books Scheme, still proud of'The Opening of the American Mind', 
prefers to lambast his colleagues at the University of Chicago rather than to 
modify his prescription.- The wrangles may be over-reported. But America's 
historic drive towards a unified language and culture looks to be losing out to 
those lobbies and pressure groups who shout loudest. 

It is an understatement to say that history did not quite work out as the 
devotees of'Western civilization' would have wished. All of them were believers 
in one or another form of European domination. Spengler was as right to record 
the West's decline as he was wrong to believe in the future supremacy of Russia. 


But the ideas linger on, and their final defeat has not yet occurred. For most 
Europeans, they have lost their former vitality. They have been shattered by two 
World Wars and by the loss of overseas empires. They will obviously make their 
last stand in the USA. 

For only in the USA do the true well-springs of'Western civilization' still 
flow. Since the collapse of the Soviet empire in 1991, the USA is the sole heir of 
European imperialism, and has inherited many of its attitudes. It may not be an 
empire of the old sort; but it has been left with 'the white man's burden'. Like 
imperial Europe before it, the USA struggles to police the world, whilst battling 
the ethnic and racial conflicts within its own borders. Like Europe today, it is in 
urgent need of a unifying mystique to outreach the dwindling attractions of mere 
democracy and consumerism. Unlike Europe, it has not known the lash of war 
on its own face within living memory. 

An absolute majority of Americans have European roots. They have adopted 
and adapted the English language and the European culture of the founding 
fathers, often in creative ways. Yet those Euro-Americans will never draw their 
main inspiration from Asia or Africa, or from studying the world in general. In 
order to cope with themselves, they have a profound need to come to terms with 
Europe's heritage. In order to do so successfully, they must liberate their view of 
Europe's past from its former limitations. If the European example shows 
anything at all, it shows that belief in the divisive propositions of 'Western 
civilization' is a sure road to disaster. 

The greatest minds in Europe's past have had no truck with the artificial 
divorce of East and West: 

Gottes ist der Orient! 

Gottes ist der Okzident! 

Nord- und siidliches Gelande 

Ruht im Frieden seiner Hiinde. 

(God's is the East; God's is the West. Northern and southern lands rest in the peace of His hands.)- 


National Histories 

In modern times, almost every European country has devoted greater energy and 
resources to the study of its own national history than to the study of Europe as a 
whole. For reasons that are very understandable, the parts have been made to 


seem more significant than the whole. Linguistic barriers, political interests, and 
the line of least resistance have helped to perpetuate the reigning citadels of 
national historiography, and the attitudes which accompany them. 

The problem is particularly acute in Great Britain, where the old routines 
have never been overturned by political collapse or national defeat. Until 
recently, British history has generally been taken to be a separate subject from 
European history-requiring a separate sort of expertise, separate courses, 
separate teachers, and separate textbooks. Traditional insularity is a fitting 
partner to the other widespread convention that equates British History with 
English History. (Only the most mischievous of historians would bother to point 
out that his English History referred only to England.)- Politicians have 
accepted the misplaced equation without a thought. In 1962, when opposing 
British entry to the European Economic Community, the leader of HM 
Opposition felt able to declare quite wrongly that such a step would spell The 
end of a thousand years of British history'.- The English are not only insular; 
most of them have never been taught the basic history of their own islands. 

Similar attitudes prevail in universities. Honourable exceptions no doubt 
exist; but Britain's largest history faculty did not start teaching 'British history' 
until 1974; and even then the content remained almost entirely English. The 
students rarely learn anything about Ireland, Scotland, or Wales. When they take 
examinations in 'European history', they are faced with a few optional questions 
about Eastern Europe and none about Britain. The net result can only be a view 
of the world where everything beyond England is alien.- The basic, and 
fallacious, assumption, writes one dissenter, 'is that everything important in 
British History can be explained in terms of British causes'. Or again: 'The 
deeply ingrained and undiminished segregation of "British"-in reality English 
-history from European history ... creates a narrowness of vision that has 
become a powerfully constricting cultural factor.'- According to another harsh 
critic, a combination of traditional structures, arcane research, and excessive 
professionalization has reduced British history to 'incoherence'. 'At the 
universities as in the schools,' he wrote before sensibly emigrating, 'the belief 
that history provides an education ... has all but vanished.'- 

Cultural history as taught at Britain's universities often clings to a narrow, 
national focus. There is a marked preference for the old-style study of national 
roots, over broad international comparisons. At the University of Oxford, for 
example, the one and only compulsory subject for all students of the English 


Faculty remains the Anglo-Saxon text of Beowulf.- Until very recently in 
Oxford's Faculty of Modern History (51c), the one and only compulsory reading 
was the Latin text of the seventh century, 'History of the English Church and 
People' by the Venerable Bede.- 

Curiosities of the same order no doubt exist in all countries. In Germany, for 
instance, universities suffer from the ramifications of the Humboldtian principle 
of 'academic freedom'. German history professors are reputedly free to teach 
whatever they like. German history students are free to learn whatever they 
choose from the menu served up by their professors. In most universities, the 
only rule is that each student must choose at least one course from ancient 
history, one from medieval, and one from modern. At times of great pressure 
from the German state, therefore, professors sympathetic to official ideology 
were free to load the menu with a heavy dose of German national history. (Back 
to the Teutonic tribes, once again.) In more recent times, when the state has been 
loath to interfere, they have been free to devise a menu where German national 
history can be completely avoided by any student so inclined. 

The problem of national bias is probably best observed in the realm of school 
textbooks and popular histories. The more that historians have to condense and 
to simplify their material, the harder it is to mask their prejudices. A few 
comments are called for. 

In the first place, it may be taken for granted that historical education in most 
European countries has traditionally possessed a strong nationalistic flavour. In 
its origins in the nineteenth century, history-teaching was recruited to the service 
of patriotism. In its most primitive form, it consisted of little more than a rota of 
the names, dates, and titles of the ruling dynasty. From that it progressed to a 
recital of the nation's heroes, victories, and achievements, [bouboulina] In its 
most extreme form, it deliberately set out to condition schoolchildren for their 
future role as killers and casualties in the nation's wars.- On the other hand, it is 
not right to assume that nationalistic history-teaching has passed unchallenged. 
There has been a long countercurrent of trying to inculcate an awareness of 
wider horizons; and practices changed radically after 1945, at least in Western 
Europe.- 

A remarkable textbook on 'modern history', published in Austrian Galicia in 
1889, directly confronted the assumptions of the age of nationalism. The book 
was designed for Polish-language secondary schools. Its author, a historian from 
Warsaw, who could not publish freely in his home city, then under Russian rule, 


explained the priorities: 

In the struggles and achievements of the modern era, nations do not act on their own, but collectively. They 
are joined together in a variety of interrelated groupings and alliances. For this reason, we are obliged to use 
the 'synchronic method', that is, to speak of all the nations who participated in the events of any given time. 
Such general history cannot present a complete picture of all the nations involved; and ... their individual 
histories ... must be consigned to (the category) of special, national histories.- 

The result was a book where, in volume I, covering the period from the 
Renaissance to 1648, Habsburg and Polish events occupy exactly 71 and 519 
pages respectively. The author makes a careful distinction between 'Poland' and 
'the Polish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian-Prussian state'. The student could learn in 
some detail about 'the Catholic and the Lutheran Reformations', as about Islam 
and the Ottomans. The geographical range stretched from the Portuguese 
voyages of discovery to Ivan the Terrible's conquest of the Khanate of Kazan, 
from Mary Stuart's overthrow in Edinburgh to Charles V's expedition to Tunis.- 
This volume would rate more highly on the non-nationalist scale than many still 
emanating from member states of the European Community.- 

It is also fair to say that concerted attempts have been made in recent years to 
purge educational materials of the grosser forms of misinformation. Bilateral 
textbook commissions have worked long and hard on such matters as militarism, 
place-names and historical atlases, and one-sided interpretations. Scholars and 
teachers are possibly more aware of the problems than previously.- In the last 
analysis, two extremes can be observed. At one extreme is the cosmic approach, 
where historians are expected to write, and students to learn, about all parts of 
the world in all ages. At the other extreme lies the parochial approach, where 
attention is reserved for one country in one short period of time. The cosmic 
approach has breadth, but lacks depth. The parochial approach has the chance of 
depth, but lacks breadth. The ideal must be somehow to strike a balance between 
breadth and depth. 

On this score, one has to admit that the centrally planned syllabuses and 
textbooks of Soviet bloc countries were sometimes more successful than those of 
their Western counterparts. Though the actual content tended to be horrendously 
chauvinist and ideological, the chronological and geographical framework was 
often admirably comprehensive. All Soviet schoolchildren had to work their way 
through the five stages of historical development, gaining some knowledge of 
primitive society, classical antiquity, 'feudalism', 'capitalism', and from 1917 
so-called 'socialism'. Courses on the history of the USSR insisted on giving 


priority to the leading historical role of Russia and the Russians. At the same 
time, even in the worst years of Stalinism, any standard Soviet textbook would 
devote space to the ancient Greeks, Scythians, and Romans, to the history of the 
Caucasus, to the empires of Genghis Khan and Tamerlane, and to the Muslim 
states of Kazan or Crimea. One would look in vain for such things in most 
general histories of Europe. 

In England, in contrast-where the syllabus of history-teaching has largely 
been left to individual schools and teachers-the chronological and geographical 
framework tends to be extremely narrow. Even senior pupils studying history at 
advanced level are often confined to standard courses such as The Tudors and 
Stuarts' or 'Britain in the Nineteenth Century'.- 

Local history provides an interesting solution to some of these dilemmas. It 
draws on the familiar and the down-to-earth, encourages individual exploration 
and research, and is relatively resistant to nationalistic or to ideological 
pressures. It is well suited to subjects such as the family, which is readily 
understood by schoolchildren, whilst being used by specialists as the basis for 
far-flung international theorizing.- At the other end of the scale world history 
has been developed, both at schools and universities. It has strong arguments in 
its favour for the education of a generation which must take their place in The 
global village'.- Its critics would argue, as some argue about European history, 
that the sheer size of its content condemns all but its most able practitioners to 
deal in worthless generalities. 

Naturally, narrowness of one kind provides an opportunity for breadth of a 
different kind. The narrowing of chronological and geographical parameters 
enables teachers to widen the variety of techniques and perspectives that can be 
explored within the chosen sector. Generally speaking, English pupils are 
relatively well grounded in the study of sources, in causational problems, in the 
connections between political, socio-economic, and cultural factors, and in the 
art of thinking for themselves. Here, their historical education has strength. On 
the other hand, there really must be something wrong if their studies are limited 
to 5 or 10 per cent of the span of only one-third of just one of the 38 sovereign 
states of the world's smallest continent. 

The problem of national bias will only disappear when historians and 
educators cease to regard history as a vehicle for state politics. More than 1,800 
years ago the Greek writer Lucian (ad 120-80) advised that The historian among 
his books should forget his nationality'. It was sound advice. In the longer term, 


the definitive history of Europe will probably be written by a Chinese, a Persian, 
or an African. There are some good precedents: a Frenchman once wrote the best 
introduction to Victorian England; an Englishman is now established as the 
leading historian of Italy, and the only survey of British History to give 
proportionate weight to all four nations was written by an exile in the USA.- 

So far, none of the experiments aimed at writing history 'from the European 
point of view' has met with general acclaim. Some historians, such as 
Christopher Dawson, have made the attempt by appealing to Europe's Christian 
foundations.- But Dawson's Catholic thesis did not illuminate the pluralism of 
recent centuries, and did not convince his predominantly WASP readership. 
Others have taken the task of tracing the drive for European unity.- The trouble 
here is that the list of contents is exceedingly short. Nation-states and national 
consciousness have been dominant phenomena throughout the era when history 
has been written as a systematic science. To a large extent, national histories 
have been allowed to predominate through the lack of alternatives. This may be 
regrettable; but it reflects the true condition of a Europe that has been deeply 
divided over recent centuries. Ever since the fragmentation of Christendom 
during the Renaissance and the Reformation, Europe has had no unifying ideal; 
historians cannot pretend otherwise. As some analysts have realized about the 
United States, the mosaic of Europe is every bit as important as the melting-pot. 

In all probability, therefore, it is still too early for a satisfactory European 
synthesis to be conceived and accepted. National sensitivities still abound. 
National histories cannot simply be abandoned; and it would be a gross 
distortion if the differences between Europe's nations were to be wilfully 
submerged 'in some bland Eurohistory': 

European history may be more than the sum of its parts; but it cannot be built except by studying those parts 
in their full idiosyncrasies ... It seems that... we cannot be content with national history; but 'pan-European 
history' cannot be easily achieved.- 

This is wise counsel. The implication is that the reformulating of European 
history must inch forward alongside the gradual construction of a wider 
European community. Neither will be built in a day. 

Unfortunately, national bias dies slowly. In April 1605, soon after England 
and Scotland were joined in personal union, Sir Francis Bacon wrote to the Lord 
Chancellor recommending that 'one just and complete history be compiled of 
both nations'. His wish has not yet been granted. In the words of one of the few 
British historians who are trying to address the problem of British identity, 'the 


ingrained reluctance to ask fundamental questions about the nature of Britain 
remains constant.'- 

Two Failed Visions 

The prevalence of nationalism in the twentieth century has not encouraged inter-, 
nationalist history. But two forceful attempts were made to overcome prevailing 
divisions, and to provide the ideological framework for a new, universal vision 
of Europe's past. Both attempts failed, and deserved to fail. 

Of the two, the Marxist-Leninist or Communist version of European history 
started first and lasted longest. It grew out of Marxism, whose spirit and 
intentions it ignored, and in the hands of the Bolsheviks became one of the 
coercive instruments of state policy. In the initial phase, 1917-34, under 
enthusiasts such as M. N. Pokrovsky (1868-1932), it was strongly 
internationalist in flavour. Pokrovsky fully accepted that history was 'politics 
turned towards the past'; and he threw himself with gusto into the fight against 
chauvinism. 'Great Russia was built on the bones of the non-Russian nations,' he 
wrote. 'In the past, we Russians were the greatest robbers on earth.' Yet for 
Stalin the rejection of Russia's imperial traditions was anathema; and from 1934, 
when Stalin's decrees on history-teaching took effect, the direction changed 
abruptly. Pokrovsky died, and most of his unrecanting colleagues were shot. 
Their textbooks were suppressed. In their place there appeared a virulent brew of 
vulgar Marxism and extreme Russian imperialism that was served up by all the 
ideological agencies of the USSR for the next fifty years.- 

The twin elements of communist history were at bottom contradictory. They 
were held together by the messianic dogma of an ideology that no one could 
openly question. The pseudo-Marxist element was contained in the famous Five- 
Stage Scheme, that led from prehistory to the Revolution of 1917. The Russian 
element was predicated on the special mission awarded to the Russian nation as 
the 'elder brother' of the Soviet peoples and the 'vanguard' of the world's 
proletariat. By Lenin's own admission, Soviet Russia was not yet as advanced as 
Germany and the other industrialized countries. But the 'world's first socialist 
state' had been created to sow the seeds of the world revolution, to hold the fort 
of socialism during capitalism's terminal decline, and to inherit the earth at the 
end. In the meantime, superior Soviet methods of social organization and 
economic planning would soon ensure that the capitalist world was rapidly 


overtaken. Indeed, as the final chapter of the textbooks always stressed, the 
Soviet Union was surging ahead in everything from military might to living 
standards, technology, and environmental protection. The final victory of 
socialism (as communism was always called) was taken to be scientifically 
proved and inevitable. 

Despite its lip-service to 'socialist internationalism', the historical thinking 
of the Soviets paid homage both to 'Eurocentrism' and, in a backhanded way, to 
'Western civilization'. Its Eurocentrism found expression in the fund of 
European examples on which Marxist-Leninist argument was based, and in the 
mania for European-style industrialization. It was specially blatant in the 
emphasis placed on the historic destiny of the Russians. Soviet assumptions on 
this last score caused offence to the European members of their empire, had an 
unsettling effect on the comrades of the communist movement in the Third 
World, and was the principal cause of the Sino-Soviet split. In Chinese eyes, the 
droves of Soviet advisers and technicians who appeared in China in the 1950s 
gave a worse display of European arrogance (and bad machinery) than any 
previous wave of 'foreign devils' they had known. For the Chinese, as for Baits, 
Poles, or Georgians, the Russians' belief in their own superiority was bizarre. If 
Russians were accustomed to think of themselves as 'Westerners' in relation to 
China, they were obviously 'Easterners' in relation to the main body of 
Europeans. 

There is no doubt that Soviet communism proclaimed 'the West' to be the 
ideological enemy. At the same time it did not deny that its own roots lay in 
Europe, and that Lenin's dearest wish had been to link the revolution in Russia 
with the expected revolution in Germany. So 'Western civilization' was not all 
bad. Indeed, so long as they were dead, leading Western figures could be readily 
admired. The point was: the West had grown decadent; the East, in the hands of 
the heroic proletariat, had stayed vigorous and healthy. Sooner or later the 
capitalist regimes would fade, the socialist fatherland would give them a final 
push, the frontiers would fall, and East would be rejoined with the West under 
Soviet Russian leadership in a new revolutionary brotherhood. This is what 
Lenin had dreamed of, and what Leonid Brezhnev would have in mind when he 
talked of'a common European home'.- This view of the communists' 
messianic mission was exported, with local variations, to all the countries which 
the Soviet Union controlled. In its strictly historical aspect it sought to instil two 
cardinal dogmas-the primacy of 'socio-economic forces' and the benign nature 
of Russia's expansion. It was greatly boosted by the Soviet defeat of Germany in 


1941-5, and was still being taught as gospel to tens of millions of European 
students and schoolchildren in the late 1980s. Right at the end of communism's 
career, the General Secretary of the CPSU, Mikhail Gorbachev, revived the 
slogan of 'a common European home'.- It was seized on by many foreign 
commentators and widely welcomed; but Gorbachev never had time to explain 
what he meant. He was dictator of an empire from Kaliningrad to Kamchatka-a 
peninsula as remote, and as European, as neighbouring Alaska. Could it be 
possible that Gorbachev's dream was of a Greater Europe, stretching right round 
the globe? 

The rival, fascist version of history started later, and nourished more briefly. To 
some extent it grew up in response to Communism, and in the hands of the Nazis 
became one of the instruments of their New Order. In the initial phase, 1922-34, 
it contained a certain socialist flavour both in Germany and Italy, but was 
dominated by the Italian variant and by Mussolini's dream of a restored Roman 
Empire. From 1934, when Hitler began to remodel Germany, the direction 
changed abruptly. The socialist element of National Socialism was purged. The 
German variant of fascism took the driving seat, and overtly racial theories came 
to the fore. As a result, there appeared a virulent brew of racism and German 
imperialism that was served up by all the ideological agencies of the Nazi Reich 
as long as it lasted.- 

Despite Nazi-Soviet hostility, Nazi ideology was not so completely different 
from that of Stalinism. The racial element was predicated on the special mission 
supposedly awarded to the German nation as the most vigorous and healthy 
branch of the white Aryan race. The German imperial element was predicated on 
the criminal 'Diktat' of Versailles, and on Germany's supposed right to recover 
its leading position. Together, they formed the basis of a programme which 
assumed that Nazi power would spread across Europe, and eventually beyond it. 
There were serious incompatibilities with fascist ideologies elsewhere in Europe, 
especially in Italy, whose nationalism had always possessed strong anti- 
Germanic overtones. But these did not have the time to ferment. 

The historical thinking of the Nazis contained the most extreme versions of 
'Eurocentrism' and 'Western civilization' that have ever existed. The 'Master 
Race' was identified with Aryan Europeans, wherever they lived in the world. 
They were the only true human beings, and were credited with all the most 
important achievements of the past. All non-Aryans (non-whites and non- 


Europeans) were classed as genetically inferior, and were placed in descending 
categories of Untermenschen or 'subhumans'. A parallel hierarchy of biological 
merit was established within Europe, with the tall, slim, blond, Nordic type-as 
tall as Goebbels, as slim as Goering, as blond as Hitler-considered superior to 
all others. The Slavs of the East (Poles, Russians, Serbs, etc.), who were wrongly 
classified as a racial subgroup, were declared inferior to the dominant Germanic 
peoples of the West, and were treated on a level with various non-Aryan 
subhumans. The lowest categories of European inhabitants were those of non- 
European origin-principally gypsies and Jews-who were blamed for all the 
evils of European history, and were deprived of the right to life. 

Nazi strategy was largely constructed from these absurdities, where the 
distinction between 'West' and 'East' was paramount. Beyond the removal of 
recalcitrant governments, Hitler harboured few designs against Western Europe, 
of which he felt himself to be the champion. He despised the French, whose 
Frankishness had been much diluted, and whose historic hatred for Germany had 
somehow to be cured. He disliked the Italians and their Roman connections, and 
felt them to be unreliable partners. He respected the Spaniards, who had once 
saved Europe from the Blacks, and was puzzled by Franco's reluctance to co¬ 
operate. With the exception of certain degenerate individuals, he admired the 
'Anglo-Saxons', and found their persistent hostility towards him distressing. In 
his own terms, their behaviour could only be explained as that of fellow 
Germanics who were preparing to compete for mastery of the Master Race. All 
he wanted from them was that they should leave him alone. 

All of the Nazis' most radical ambitions were directed against the East. Mein 
Kampf clearly identified Eastern Europe as the site of Germany's Lebensraurriy 
her future 'living space'. Eastern Europe was inhabited by an assortment of 
inferior Slavs and Jews; its genetic stock had to be improved by massive German 
colonization. The 'diseased elements' had to be surgically removed, that is, 
murdered. Eastern Europe was also the sphere of Soviet power; and the 'nest of 
Jewish Bolshevism' had to be smashed. When the Nazis launched the German 
invasions of Eastern Europe, first against Poland and then against the Soviet 
Union, they felt they were launching a 'Crusade'. And they said so explicidy. 
They were told by their history books that they were marching in the glorious 
steps of Henry the Fowler, the Teutonic Knights, and Frederick the Great. They 
claimed to be speeding to the ultimate showdown of'a thousand years of 
history'. 



Unlike Communism, Nazism was not granted seventy-five years in which to 
elaborate its theory and practice. It was destroyed by the combined efforts of its 
neighbours, before the Greater Reich could be consolidated. It never reached the 
point where a Nazi-run Europe would have been obliged to articulate its posture 
towards the other continents. Yet if the Soviets had succumbed, as they very 
nearly did in 1941-2, Nazism would have become the driving force of a 
Eurasian power of immense size; and it would have had to prepare for a global 
confrontation against rival centres in the USA and Japan. Conflict would surely 
have ensued. As it was, Nazidom was kept within Europe's bounds. Hitler was 
not given the chance to operate beyond the world of his fellow Aryans. Both as 
theorist and as political leader, he remained to the end a European. 

Though Nazidom once stretched from the Atlantic to the Volga, the Nazi 
version of history was only free to operate for a very brief interval. In Germany 
itself, its career was limited to a mere twelve years-less than the school days of 
one single class. Elsewhere, it could only sow its poison for a matter of weeks or 
months. Its impact was intense, but fleeting in the extreme. When it collapsed in 
disgrace in 1944-5, it left a gaping vacuum that could only be filled by the 
historical thoughts of the victorious powers. In Eastern Europe, occupied from 
1944-5 by the Soviet army, the Soviet version was imposed without ceremony. 
Western Europe, liberated by the Anglo-Americans, was left open for 'the Allied 
Scheme of History'. 

The Allied Scheme of History 

Contemporary views of Europe have been strongly influenced by the emotions 
and experiences of two World Wars and especially by the victory of the 'Grand 
Alliance'. Thanks to their triumphs in 1918, in 1945, and at the end of the Cold 
War in 1989, the Western Powers have been able to export their interpretation of 
events worldwide. They have been particularly successful in this regard in 
Germany whose receptiveness was heightened by a combination of native guilt 
and Allied re-education policies. 

The priorities and assumptions which derive from Allied attitudes of the 
wartime vintage are very common in accounts of the twentieth century; and are 
sometimes projected back into more remote periods. They may be tentatively 
summarized as follows: 


-The belief in a unique, secular brand of Western civilization in which 



'the Atlantic community' is presented as the pinnacle of human progress. 
Anglo-Saxon democracy, the rule of law in the tradition of Magna Carta, 
and a capitalist, free-market economy are taken to be the highest forms of 
Good. Keystones in the scheme include the Wilsonian principle of 
National Self-determination (1917) and the Atlantic Charter (1941). 

-The ideology of'anti-fascism', in which the Second World War of 
1939-45 is perceived as 'the War against Fascism' and as the defining 
event in the triumph of Good over Evil. Opposition to fascism, or 
suffering at its hands, is the overriding measure of merit. The opponents 
or the victims of fascists deserve the greatest admiration and sympathy. 

-A demonological fascination with Germany, the twice-defeated enemy. 
Germany stands condemned as the prime source both of the malignant 
imperialism which produced the First World War, and of the virulent 
brand of fascism which provoked the Second. Individuals and nations 
who fought on the German side, especially in 1939-45, bear the stigma 
of'collaboration'. (N.B. German culture is not to be confused with 
German politics.) 

-An indulgent, romanticized view of the Tsarist empire and the Soviet 
Union, the strategic ally in the East, commonly called 'Russia'. Russia's 
manifest faults should never be classed with those of the enemy. For 
Russia is steadily converging with the West. Russia's great merits as a 
partner in the 'anti-fascist' alliance, whose huge sacrifices brought 
fascism to its knees, outweigh all the negative aspects of her record. 

-The unspoken acceptance of the division of Europe into Western and 
Eastern spheres. Whereas 'Atlantic values' are expected to predominate 
in the more advanced West, Russia's understandable desire for security 
justifies its domination over the backward East. It is natural for the 
Western Powers to protect themselves against the threat of further 
Russian expansion, but they should not interfere in Russia's legitimate 
sphere of influence. 

-The studied neglect of all facts which do not add credence to the 
above. 


The Allied scheme of history grew naturally out of the politics and 
sympathies of two world wars, and has never been consciously or precisely 
formulated. In the hurly-burly of free societies it could never establish a 



monopoly, nor has it ever been systematically contested. Yet half a century after 
the Second World War it was everywhere evident in academic discussions and, 
perhaps unknowingly, in the conceptual framework which informs the policy 
decisions of governments. It was the natural residue of a state of affairs where 
Allied soldiers could be formally arrested for saying that Hitler and Stalin 'are 
equally evil'.- 

In the academic sphere, the Allied scheme can be seen at work in 
institutional priorities and structures, as well as in debates on particular issues. It 
has contributed to the crushing preponderance of research in history and political 
science that is devoted to Nazi or Nazi-related themes, and to the prominence of 
German studies, especially in the USA. It helps explain why the analysis of East 
European affairs continues to be organized in separate institutes of 'Soviet' or 
'Slavonic' studies, and why the sovietological profession was notoriously 
reluctant to expose the realities of Soviet life.- It was responsible in part for the 
excessive emphasis on Russian within the Soviet and Slavic field, often to the 
total exclusion of non-Russian cultures. It was present, above all, in the 
assumptions and illusions surrounding views on the Second World War. Half a 
century after that war was fought, the majority of episodes which contradict the 

Allied myth continued to be minimized or discounted, [altmarkt] [katyn] 
[KEELHAUL] 

Many wartime stereotypes have been perpetuated, especially regarding 
Eastern Europe. One can observe a clear-cut hierarchy of perceptions at work 
which are related to the degree of subservience of various nations to the Allied 
cause. The Czechs and Serbs, for example, who had a long tradition of co¬ 
operation with Russia and of hostility towards Germany, fitted well into the 
Allied scheme. So they could be hailed as 'brave', 'friendly', and 'democratic'- 
at least until the wars in Bosnia. The Slovaks, Croats, and Baltic nations, in 
contrast, who were thought to have rejected the friends of the West or to have 
collaborated with the enemy, deserved no such compliments. The Poles, as 
always, fitted no one's scheme. By resisting German aggression, they were 
obviously fighting staunchly for democracy. By resisting Soviet aggression, they 
were obviously 'treacherous', 'fascistic', 'irresponsible', and 'anti-democratic'. 
The Ukrainians, too, defied classification. Although they probably suffered 
absolutely the largest number of civilian casualties of any European nation, their 
main political aim was to escape from Soviet and Russian domination. The best 
thing to do with such an embarrassing nation was to pretend that it didn't exist, 
and to accept the old Tsarist fiction about their being 'Little Russians'. In reality 


they were neither little nor Russians, [ukraina] 

In the political sphere, the Allied scheme has been the foundation stone of 
the USA's supposed 'special relationship' with the United Kingdom, and one 
source for the exclusion of democratic Germany and democratic Japan from 
bodies such as the UN Security Council. It was explicit when a British Prime 
Minister scolded the French President over the relative merits of Magna Carta 
and the 'Rights of Man', or when the prospect of a European 'superstate' was 
blasted in tones reminiscent of Pitt or Churchill. It underlay the vote in the 
British House of Commons in favour of a War Crimes Bill which limits those 
crimes to offences committed 'in Germany or in German-controlled territory'- 
as if no other war crimes count. Arguably, it was present when a national 
Holocaust Memorial Museum was opened in Washington.- 

The hold of the Allied scheme was perhaps most strongly evident, however, 
in reactions to the collapse of communism after 1989. The outburst 
of'Gorbymania', the priority given to the integrity of wartime allies (first the 
USSR and then Yugoslavia), and the wilful confusing of patriotism with 
nationalism in Eastern Europe can only be explained in terms of pre-set 
historical reflexes. It was only by a slow process of readjustment that Western 
opinion learned that 'Russia' and the 'Soviet Union' were not the same thing; 
that Gorbachev headed a deeply hated regime; that the Yugoslav Federation was 
a communist front organization; that the most extreme nationalism was 
emanating from the communist leadership of Serbia; or that Lithuania, Slovenia, 
Ukraine, or Croatia were distinct European nations legitimately seeking 
statehood. The realization that 'the West' had been misled on so many basic 
issues was bound to swell demands for the revision of European history. 

Eurohistory 

The movement for European unity which began in Western Europe after 1945 
was fired by an idealism that contained an important historical dimension. It 
aimed to remove the welter of ultra-nationalistic attitudes which had fuelled the 
conflicts of the past. All communities require both a sense of present identity and 
the sense of a shared past. So historical revision was a natural requirement. The 
first stage sought to root out the historical misinformation and 
misunderstandings which had proliferated in all European countries. The second 
stage was to build a consensus on the positive content of a new 'Eurohistory'. 


The Council of Europe provided the forum within which most early 
discussions took place. As an organization supported by twenty-four 
governments in Western Europe, it was never bounded by the political horizons 
either of the EEC or of NATO; and in the cultural field it gained the co-operation 
of four non-member countries from the Soviet bloc, Poland, Czechoslovakia, 
Hungary, and the USSR. Its input ranged from the Vatican to the Kremlin. From 
the first colloquium, which was organized at Calw in 1953 on 'The European 
Idea in History Teaching', the Council organized at least one major international 
meeting on historical matters every year for forty years. A1965 symposium on 
'Teaching Histor' at Elsinore and a 1986 seminar on 'The Viking Age' 
emphasized the desirability both of broad-based themes and of a generous 
geographical and chronological spread. 

Apart from historical didactics, and the problems of introducing a skills- 
based 'new history' into school-teaching, the main focus lay on the elimination 
of national bias and religious prejudice from European education. Special 
attention was given to the shortcomings of national history textbooks. Numerous 
bilateral commissions were established for examining the sins of omission and 
commission of which all European educators were guilty in the presentation of 
their own and their neighbours' past. In this the Georg Eckert Institute for 
International Textbook Research, established at Braunschweig in West Germany 
played a pioneering role.- 

The obstacles to creating a consensus about European history, however, were 
legion. One line, following the Gaullist concept of a Europe des patries, might 
have contented itself with an amalgam of national histories shorn of all offensive 
material. Others have sought to fuse the national elements into a more coherent 
whole. A major obstacle lay in shifting political realities, and the expanding 
membership of the (West) European Community. It was one thing to imagine a 
history which might reconcile the historical perceptions of the original 'Six'; it 
was a much greater task to anticipate the sensitivities of the Twelve, the 
Nineteen, or even the Thirty-Eight. By the 1990s the notion of European unity 
could no longer be confined to Western Europe. 'Modern History syllabuses will 
have to abandon the old bifocal view of Europe in favour of an all-embracing 
concept.'- In the mean time, brave souls had not been deterred from attempting 
a new synthesis. 

One history project that was financially supported (though not originated) by 
the European Commission in Brussels was conceived prior to the political 


deluge of 1989-91. Labelled 'An Adventure in Understanding', it was planned 
in three stages: a 500-page survey of European history, a 10-part television 
series, and a school textbook to be published simultaneously in all eight 
languages of the EC. Its authors were quite open about their 'political quest': 
their aim was to replace history written according to the ethos of the sovereign 
nation-state: 


Nationalism, and the fragmentation of Europe into nation-states, are relatively recent phenomena: they may 
be temporary, and are certainly not irreversible. The end of Empires and the destmction wrought by 
nationalism have been accompanied by the defeat of totalitarianism and the triumph of liberal democracy in 
Western Europe, completed in 1974-5. This has enabled people to begin to rise above their nationalistic 

109 

instincts.- 


'Nationalistic instincts' was an unfortunate phrase. But the principal author, who 
had published both on early Christianity and on L'Idee de I'Europe dans ehistoire 
(1965), was convinced of Europe's basic 'unity in diversity': 'There are solid 
historic reasons for regarding Europe not only as a mosaic of cultures but as an 
organic whole.' 

The timing of the venture was unfortunate, since it reached the market at the 
very time when its geographical frame of reference had just collapsed. It had 
defined 'Europe' as the territory of the member states of the EC, with 
Scandinavia, Austria, and Switzerland thrown in. The status of Finland, Poland, 
Hungary, and Bohemia, it had intimated, was not clear. So here was yet another 
exercise in Western civilization. Several of the critics were not kind. Its moral 
tone was likened by one reviewer as 'reminiscent ... of Soviet-bloc 
historiography'. Elsewhere its approach was summed up in the headline 'Half- 
truths about half of Europe'.- 

The Greeks in particular were incensed. Although Greece had been a 
member state of the EC since 1981, Duroselle had largely omitted the 
contributions of ancient Greece and Byzantium. Letters of protest were 
addressed to the European Commission by several Greek MEPs, the Archbishop 
of Athens, and others. The text was likened to the Satanic Verses. Attention was 
drawn to the opinion of the French historian, Ernest Renan: 'L'Europe est 
grecque par la pensee et l'art, romaine par le droit, et judeo-chretienne par la 
religion.' (Europe is Greek in its thought and its art, Roman in its law, and 
Judaeo-Christian in its religion.) A British correspondent invoked the Greek 
origins of the words Europa and Istoria. If the Greek contribution is to be 
denied, he asked, one wonders what this book ought to be called. In due course 


the European Commission was obliged to dissociate itself from the project. 

The most telling observation was made amongst remarks originating in the 
Academy of Athens. It concerned M. Duroselle's concept of'a European history 
of Europe'. If a study addressed almost exclusively to Western Europe was to be 
categorized as 'European', it followed that the rest of Europe was somehow not 
European. ' "Non-western" is made to mean "non-European"; "Europe" equals 
"West" in everything but simple geography.'- Eastern Europe-whether 
Byzantine Europe, Orthodox Europe, Slavic Europe, Ottoman Europe, Balkan 
Europe, or Soviet Europe-was to be permanently beyond the pale. Here was the 
fundamental fallacy which led M. Duroselle to discuss 'the ancient peoples of 
Europe' without mentioning either the Greeks or the Slavs. The author's attempts 
to defend himself were not always felicitous. Charged that his book did not 
mention the Battle of Marathon, he was said to have countered with the news 
that it did not mention the Battle of Verdun either-in which case it must be 
judged as weak on West European history as on European history as a whole.- 

The project's textbook, composed by twelve historians from twelve different 
countries, appeared in 1992. The text had been established by collective 
discussion. A French account of'the Barbarian Invasions' was changed to 'the 
Germanic Invasions'. A Spanish description of Sir Francis Drake as a 'pirate' 
was overruled. A picture of General de Gaulle among the portraits on the cover 
was replaced by one of Queen Victoria. For whatever reason, The European 
History Book did not find a British publisher, and was judged unlikely to pass 
the strict authorization criteria of the sixteen German Lander.- 

Eurohistory, however, was not engaged on frivolous business. Its strong point lay 
in the search for a dynamic vision of a European community that would be 
capable of creating its own mystique. In its initial form, that vision was of 
necessity stunted. After all, it saw its origins in the middle of the Cold War. But 
it may have grasped an essential truth-that sovereign national states do not 
offer the sole form of sound political community. National states are themselves 
'imagined communities': they are built on powerful myths, and on the political 
rewriting of history: 

All communities larger than the primordial villages of face-to-face contact (and perhaps even these) are 
imagined... . members of even the smallest nation will never know their fellow members ... and yet in the 
mind of each lives the image of their communion.- 


Europeans need that same imagination. Sooner or later, a convincing new picture 
of Europe's past will have to be composed to accompany the new aspirations for 
Europe's future. 

The European movement of the 1990s may succeed or it may fail. If it 
succeeds, it will owe much to the historians who will have helped to give it a 
sense of community. They will have helped to provide a spiritual home for those 
millions of Europeans whose multiple identities and multiple loyalties already 
transcend existing frontiers. 

European History 

When asked to define 'European history', many professional historians cannot 
give a clear answer. They do not usually concern themselves with such matters. 
If pressed, however, most of them would contrast the certainties of past 
assumptions with the confusions of the present. An enquiry organized by a 
historical journal in 1986 brought some revealing replies. One distinguished 
scholar said: 

When I was a schoolboy in France in the 1930s, the answer to ... 'What is European History?' seemed 
simple and obvious ...; any place, event, or personality that has a relationship to France belongs to 
European History (nay, to History tout court.) ... [But now], there is no single European history, but rather 


A second respondent delivered a homily about Europe's traditional 
parochialism and the need for world-wide horizons: 

The concept of European History, indeed the History of Europe, was but history seen with the eyes of 
Europe and with a European vision of History ... This kind of presentation is indefensible today.- 

The implication seemed to be that the Eurocentric attitudes of his misguided 
predecessors had somehow invalidated the entire subject. 

A Hungarian contributor pointed to the eccentric British habit of 
distinguishing 'European' from 'British' history.- Through this distinction, 
'European' is made to mean 'Continental', and the British part is made to appear 
as something completely unique. 

Yet another contributor offered an analysis of three separate definitions of 
European History. He listed 'the geographical', 'the cultural or civilizational', 
and a category which he described as 'a convenient shorthand for the central 


zone of the capitalist world-economy as it has developed since the sixteenth 
century'.- 

In Magdalen College, one was used to more incisive opinions. Mr A. J. P. 
Taylor produced an inimitable sample for the benefit of the journal's enquiry: 

European History is whatever the historian wants it to be. It is a summary of the events and ideas, political, 
religious, military, pacific, serious, romantic, near at hand, far away, tragic, comic, significant, meaningless, 
anything else you would like it to be. There is only one limiting factor. It must take place in, or derive from, 
the area we call Europe. But as I am not sure what exactly that area is meant to be, I am pretty well in a 
haze about the rest.- 


As usual, my old tutor was more than half-right, and completely amusing. But he 
put himself in the company of those who imply that European history, even if it 
exists, is not a subject worth worrying about. 

In the end, therefore, intellectual definitions raise more questions than they 
answer. It is the same with European history as with a camel. The practical 
approach is not to try and define it, but to describe it.

PENINSULA 

Environment and Prehistory 


There is a marked determinism about many descriptions of Europe's 
environmental history. Many Europeans have assumed that their 'continent' was 
so magnificently endowed that it was destined by Nature for world supremacy. 
And many have imagined that Europe's good fortune would somehow last 
forever. 'The empire of climate', wrote Montesquieu in 1748, 'is the first of all 
empires'; and he proceeded to show that the European climate had no rival. For 
Montesquieu, as for his many successors, Europe was synonymous with 
Progress.- 

There has also been a good deal of national parochialism. Even the founder 
of human geography, the great Paul Vidal de la Blache (1845-1918), one of the 
intellectual ancestors of the Anuales school, was not above a touch of Gallic 
chauvinizing. The geography of France, he stressed, was marked by the keynote 
of variety. 'Against the diversities which assail her', he wrote, 'France sets her 
force d'assimilation, her power of assimilation. She transforms everything that 
she receives.' On Britain, in contrast, he quotes the doggerel lines about 'this 
paltry little isle, I with acres few and weather vile'. One hundred years later one 
finds Fernand Braudel doing similar things. 2 Variety is indeed a characteristic of 
France's superb make-up. But it is not a French monopoly, it is a hallmark of 
Europe as a whole. 

In fact, the Peninsula of Europe is not really a 'continent' at all: it is not a 





self-contained land mass. At c.10 million km 2 (3.6 million square miles), it is 
less than one-quarter the size of Asia, one-third of Africa, one-half of each of the 
Americas. Modern geographers classify it, like India, as a subcontinent of 
Eurasia: 'a cape of the old continent, a western appendix of Asia 5 . Even so, it is 
impossible to deny that Europe has been endowed with a formidable repertoire 
of physical features. Europe's landforms, climate, geology, and fauna have 
combined to produce a benign environment that is essential to an understanding 
of its development. 





Map 4. Europe: Physical Regions 


Europe's landforms do not resemble those of any other continent or 
subcontinent. The depressions to north and south have been flooded by the ocean 
to form two parallel sea-chains which penetrate deep into the interior. In the 
north, the North Sea-Baltic sea lane stretches 1,500 miles (2,500 km) from the 




Atlantic to Russia. In the south, the Mediterranean-Black Sea system stretches 
over 2,400 miles (4,000 km) from Gibraltar to the Caucasus. Within these 
protected seas lie a vast complex of lesser gulfs and a huge spangle of islands. 
As a result, the ratio of shoreline to landmass is exceptionally high: at c.37,000 
km, or more than 23,000 miles, the European shoreline is almost exactly the 
length of the Equator. For early Man, this was perhaps the most important 
measure of accessibility. 

What is more, since the shores of the Peninsula lie in the temperate latitudes 
of Eurasia's western extremity, they are served by a user-friendly climate. 
Prevailing ocean winds blow westerly; and it is the western coasts of the great 
continents that stand to benefit most from the moderating influx of sea air. Yet 
few other west-facing continental coasts can actually enjoy the advantage. 
Elsewhere, if the western shore is not blocked by towering peaks or icy currents, 
it is lined by deserts such as the Sahara, the Kalahari, or the Atacama. 

The climate of Europe, therefore, is unusually temperate for its latitude. 
Generally speaking, under the influence of the Gulf Stream, northern Europe is 
mild and moist; southern Europe is relatively warm, dry, and sunny. Central and 
eastern Europe enjoy elements of a true continental climate, with clear, cold 
winters and baking hot summers. But everywhere the weather is changeable. 
Extremes are usually avoided. Even in European Russia, where the difference 
between the mean temperatures of January and July can approach 45 °C, the 
range is only half what it is in Siberia. The wettest district in Europe is in 
western Norway, with an average annual precipitation of 3,500 mm (138 inches). 
The dryest district surrounds the Caspian Sea, with less than 250 mm (9 inches) 
per annum. The coldest spot is Vorkuta, with a mean January chill of -20°C; the 
hottest is disputed between Seville and Astrakhan, both with mean July roasts of 
+29°C. These extremes do not compare with their counterparts in Asia, Africa, 
or the Americas. 

Europe's temperate climate favoured the requirements of primitive 
agriculture. Most of the Peninsula lies within the natural zone of cultivable 
grasses. There were abundant woodlands to provide fuel and shelter. Upland 
pasture often occurs in close proximity to fertile valleys. In the west and south, 
livestock can winter in the open. Local conditions frequently encouraged special 
adaptations. The extensive coastline, combined with the broad Continental Shelf, 
gave fishermen rich rewards. The open plains, especially of the Danube Basin, 
preserved the nomadic horse-rearing and cattle-driving of the Eurasian steppes. 



In the Alps-which take their name from the high pastures above the tret-line- 
transhumance has been practised from an early date. 

Europe's climate was probably also responsible for the prevalent skin-colour 
of its human fauna. Moderate levels of sunshine, and hence of ultra-violet 
radiation, meant that moderate levels of pigmentation came to be encoded in the 
Peninsula's gene pool. Certainly, in historic times pale faces have predominated, 
together with blond or golden hair and blue eyes in the northern regions. The 
great majority of Europeans and their descendants can be easily recognized as 
such from their looks. 

Until recently, of course, it was impossible to take anything but the most 
superficial racial factors into consideration. The analysis of blood groups, body 
tissues, and DNA imprints, for example, was unknown until the late twentieth 
century; and it was not realized just how much genetic material all human beings 
have in common. As a result, racial theorists were apt to draw conclusions from 
external criteria such as skin colour, stature, or skull form. In reality, the racial 
make-up of Europe's population has always displayed considerable variety. The 
tall, blue-eyed, fair-skinned, platinum blonds of the so-called 'Nordic race' 
which established itself in Scandinavia forms the only group remotely qualified 
for the label of 'white'. They bore little resemblance to the squat, brown-eyed, 
swarthy-skinned and black-haired people of the so-called 'Mediterranean' or 
'Indo-Mediterranean Race' which dominated large parts of the south. Between 
the two extremes there were numerous gradations. Most of the Peninsula's 
population can be clearly distinguished from the Mongoloid, Indoid, and 
Negroid races, but not from other groups predominating in the Near East and 
North Africa. 

Some of the most promising advances in the field of prehistory are now 
being made through modern genetic research. The refinement of serology, the 
discovery of DNA (1953), and the subsequent operation of mapping the 3,000 
million 'letters' on human genes permit investigations of a very sophisticated 
nature. The correlation of genetic and linguistic records now suggests that the 
patterns of biological and cultural evolution may be closer than imagined. 
Recent studies show that the movement of genetic material into prehistoric 
Europe corresponded with parallel cultural trends. 'Genes, peoples, and 
languages have ... diverged in tandem,' writes a leading scholar.- Local studies 
show that isolated cultural communities, such as the non-Indo-European 
Basques, possess recognizable genetic traces of their own. There are no general 


conclusions. But the study of Europe's genetic inheritance, once a pseudo¬ 
science, is now a respectable pursuit. At last, 'we are beginning to read the 
messages left to us by distant ancestors'.- [cauca-sia] [tammuz] 

From the psychological point of view, the Peninsula presented early man 
with a stimulating blend of opportunity and challenge. It created a degree of 
stress that demanded enterprise but was still manageable. Life was hard but 
rewarding. Seasonal rhythms fostered activities which required routine and 
foresight. The changeable weather stimulated flexibility. There were plenty of 
natural hazards to be overcome-ocean gales, winter snows, summer droughts, 
and disease; yet the prospects for health and survival were good. One may 
surmise that the primitive settlers of prehistoric Europe felt less at risk than their 
descendants on the eastern seaboard of North America several millennia later. 

It would be rash to state that the European Peninsula was the only location 
where human civilization could have developed as it did; yet most of the 
alternative locations had their drawbacks. Compared to the sub-tropical river 
valleys where mankind first flourished, the seasonal rhythms and benign 
moderation of the Peninsula provided an altogether more receptive setting for 
sustained development. The geological and biological environment is rich and 
varied. There are 'young' alpine mountains, ancient primary hills, active 
volcanoes; deep gorges and wide plains; racing upland torrents, broad rivers, 
lakes by the thousand; sub-arctic tundra, permafrost, glaciers; rocky coasts, 
sandy beaches, and spreading deltas. There are open grasslands, spacious 
deciduous woods, gloomy pine-forests, and sub-tropical palms; leached, semi- 
desert soils, vast marshes, and zones of deep loess and 'black earth'. The range 
of plant life and fauna is large. Enough of Europe's wildernesses have survived 
to show what the primeval habitat would have resembled. 

Importantly, however, the scale of heights and distances is far less forbidding 
than elsewhere. Europe's localities are linked by a network of natural pathways 
which primitive man must have found more of an invitation than a barrier. Just 
as one could paddle round most of the inland coasts in a dugout, one could float 
down any number of rivers in almost any direction. The Seine, the Rhine, the 
Elbe, Oder, Vistula, Niemen, and Dvina all flow to the north; the Ebro, the 
Rhone, the Maritsa, the Dnieper, and the Volga to the south. Tagus, Loire, and 
Severn flow to the west; Thames, Danube, Po, and Dniester to the east. Between 
them, there is an endless series of short walks and easy porterages. In the district 
of Auxois in upper Burgundy, for instance, one can stroll in the course of a few 


hours between waters that take one to the Mediterranean, the Atlantic, or the 
English Channel. In the central Alps, the sources of the Rhine and the Rhone rise 
side by side near Andermatt before flowing north and south respectively. On the 
Dvina-Dnieper porterage, in the vicinity of Vitebsk, one can easily haul a boat 
which has come from Sweden to a point that will take it to Egypt. 

One should not underestimate the lengthy process whereby the highways and 
byways of Europe were opened up to human movement and settlement. On the 
other hand, there is no comparison between the relative ease of travel in Europe 
and that in the greater continents. Caravans on the ancient silk route from China 
needed a year or more to cross the body of Asia. Yet from time immemorial any 
fit and reasonably enterprising traveller has been able to move across Europe in 
a matter of weeks, if not days. 

The division of Europe into 'natural' or 'historic' regions has long provided an 
intellectual exercise that is as entertaining as it is inconclusive. Attempts to 
define 'Western Europe', as distinct from 'Eastern Europe', have been as 
numerous as the criteria used to fix the dividing lines. (See Map 3, and 
Introduction, pp. 22-5.) The distinction between 'Northern Europe' and 
'Southern Europe' is clear and permanent in the Peninsula's central alpine sector. 
But it does not hold good to the same extent either in Europe's far west, in 
Iberia, or in Europe's far east, in the hinterland of the Black Sea. The arguments 
advanced to prove the pedigree of regions such as 'Central Europe' or 'East 
Central Europe' are as ingenious as they are contorted.- One stands on safer 
ground dividing Europe into regions based on physical and geographical 
features. 

The European Peninsula is constructed from five natural components. In 
historical times, these geographical units have remained largely constant, whilst 
the political units surmounting them have come and gone with great fickleness. 
'Earth's proud empires' are constantly passing away. But the plains and the 
mountains, the seas, peninsulas, and islands, apparently go on forever. 

1. The Great European Plain stretches without interruption for over 2,400 miles 
(4,000 km) from the Atlantic to the Urals. It is Europe's dominant territorial 
feature. Indeed, since the Urals form little more than a gentle bridge, the plain 
may be regarded as an extension of the still greater expanse of lowland 
stretching to the Verkhoyansk Ridge of eastern Siberia. At the longitude of the 


Urals it spans the 1,200 miles (2,000 km) between the Barents Sea and the 
Caspian. Between the coast and the hills in the Low Countries, it narrows to less 
than 200 km. Almost all the major rivers of the plain flow on a north-south axis, 
thereby creating a series of natural breaks to east-west traffic and dividing the 
traverse of the plain into six or seven easy stages. East of the Vistula, the 
impenetrable Pripet Marshes split the plain into two natural pathways-a 
northerly one, which skirts the Baltic lakeland, and a southerly one, serving as 
the highroad to and from the steppes, [ukraina] 

The Plain is at its most vulnerable in the section between the Rhine and the 
Oder. Here, it is overborne by ranges of impenetrable, forested hills. The 
Ardennes, the Teutoburger Wald, and the Harz remain formidable barriers even 
today. They inhibit movement both laterally along the Plain and vertically from 
the Plain to the Alps. The map of modern Germany shows how almost all the 
country's development has been channelled either onto the Plain or into the four 
river basins of the Rhine, Main, Neckar, and Danube. 

The peoples who settled on the Plain suffered from one permanent disability: 
they could find no natural limits to the territory which they chose to occupy. 
They had to fight for it. Lowlanders tend to think of themselves as docile tillers 
of the soil in contrast to the ferocious, predatory men from the hills. In reality, it 
was the plainsmen who had to learn the arts of systematic military organization 
and occupation. On the plain, one learned to strike first or to be struck down 
oneself. It is perhaps no accident that the Plain long resisted the onset of 
settlement; also that in due course it nourished the most formidable military 
powers of European history. France, Prussia, and Russia-all grew strong from 
the interminable wars of the plains, and all developed a martial tradition to 
match their predicament. The lowlands provided the setting for many of their 
most titanic encounters: at Kunersdorf and Kursk, at Leipzig and Tannenberg, at 
Waterloo and Stalingrad. 

The physical gradients of the European Plain are tipped in two different 
directions-on the one hand from the alpine ridge to the shore of the northern 
seas, and, on the other hand, from east to west, from the peak of the Urals (1,894 
m) to France's Atlantic coast. On average, the main east-west gradient falls by 
6,000 ft over almost 3,000 miles, or 26 inches per mile-a gradient of only 0.04 
per cent. 

The idea of 'cultural gradients', which run across the European Plain in the 
opposite direction to the physical ones, developed in response to Europe's 



particular patterns of settlement and of political evolution. It so happened that 
permanent settlement occurred first in the south and the west, later in the north 
and centre, and last in the east. Hence for much of the last 4,000 years, to cross 
the mountains from the Plain and to descend to the Mediterranean was actually 
to undertake a 'cultural ascent'. Similarly, in modern times, to move along the 
European Plain from west to east was widely considered to involve a 'cultural 
descent'. 


UKRAINA 

Ukraine is the land through which the greatest number of European 
peoples approached their eventual homeland. In ancient times it was 
variously known as Scythia or Sarmatia, after the peoples who dominated 
the Pontic steppes long before the arrival of the Slavs, [chersonesos] It 
occupies the largest sector of the southern European plain, between the 
Volga crossing and the Carpathian narrows; and it carries the principal 
overland pathway between Asia and Europe. Its modern, Slavonic name 
means 'On the Edge', a close counterpart to the American concept of 'the 
Frontier'. Its focal point at the rapids of the Dnieper, where the steppe 
pathway crosses the river trade-route, was fiercely contested by all comers, 
for it provided the point of transition between the settled lands to the West 
and the open steppes to the East. Ukraine is rich in mineral resources-such 
as the coal of the 'Donbass' and the iron of Krivoi Roh. The loess of its 
famous 'black earth' underlies Europe's richest agricultural lands, which in 
the years prior to 1914 were to become the Continent's leading exporter of 
grain. 

Yet apart from the peninsula of Crimea and the main river valleys-the 
Dnistro, the Dnipro, and the Din, which had served as the focus both for 
[khazaria] and for the first East Slav state (see Appendix III, p. 1249)- 
much of Ukraine was only systematically settled In modern times. Until 
then, the wide open spaces of the 'wild plains' were ruled by the raids of 
pagans and nomads and by the wars of Cossacks and Tartars. Ottoman rule 
in the 15th-18th centuries drew it closer to the Black Sea and the Muslim 
world. Polish rule after 1569 brought in many Polish landowners and Polish 




Jews. Russian rule, which was steadily extended in stages between 1654 and 
1945, brought in Russians and russification. The 'Sich' of the Zaporozhian 
Cossacks, on an island in the Dnieper, was destroyed by the Russian army in 
1775; the Tartar Khanate of Crimea in 1783. Under the Tsars, the whole 
country was officially named Tittle Russia 5 . The southern provinces 
designated for new colonization were called 'New Russia 5 . 

Not surprisingly, after so many twists and turns of fortune, Ukraine's 
modern inhabitants are fiercely attached to their land. It features prominently 
in their plaintive poetry:

However, since the plain has always been the playground of power politics, 
the Ukrainians have rarely been allowed to control their destiny. In the 
twentieth century they were repeatedly suppressed. Their short-lived 
Republic, which in 1918-20 served as one of the main battlegrounds for 
Russia's Reds and Whites, was crushed by the victorious Red Army (see pp. 
928-9). They were victims of some of the Continent's most terrible man- 



made disasters, and of wholesale genocide. Their casualties during the wars 
of 1918-20, the collectivization campaign of the 1930s, the terror-famine of 
1932-3, and the devastations of the Second World War must have 
approached 20 million, [Chernobyl] [harvest] Some among them, 
frustrated by their impotence in face of Russians, Poles, and Germans, and 
unable to reach the source of their oppression, struck out in desperate 
violence against their neighbours, [buczacz] [pogrom] Their population is 
similar in size to that of England or France, and contains important 
minorities; but the Ukrainians find very little place in the history books. For 
many years, they were usually presented to the outside world as 'Russians' 
or 'Soviets' whenever they were to be praised, and as 'Ukrainians' only 
when they did evil, [lettland] They did not recover a free voice until the 
1990s. The Republic of Ukraine eventually reclaimed its independence in 
December 1991, facing an uncertain future. 2 


This concept of the Kulturgefalle or 'cultural gradient' was implicit in the 
ideology of German nationalism, which reacted against the cultural dominance 
of the West whilst laying claim to the East. It can be observed in some aspects of 
French attitudes to Belgium and Germany, of German attitudes to the Slavs, of 
Polish attitudes to Russia and Ukraine, of Russian attitudes to the peoples of 
Central Asia. Human nature always tempts people to imagine that they inhabit 
the cultural upland whilst their neighbours inhabit the Styx. In the British Isles, 
for example, the English majority are apt to perceive all cultural gradients 
sloping steadily downhill from the Himalayan peaks of Oxford or Hyde Park 
Corner to the 'Celtic fringe', the 'Scotch mist', the 'Irish bogs', and the 'Channel 
fog'. The English saying that 'wogs begin at Calais' is very close in spirit to 
France's histoires beiges to Metternich's most Viennese remark that 'Asia begins 
at the Landstrasse', or to the Polish proverb 'Na Rusi si^ musi' (in Russia, one 
has to). The prejudices inherent in their elastic cultural geography have 
undoubtedly been strengthened by fears of the instability of life on the Plain. 

Thanks to the configuration of its approaches, one small branch-line of the 
European Plain has assumed special importance. The plain of Pannonia, now in 
modern Hungary, is the only extensive stretch of grassland south of the mountain 
chain. It is protected in the north by the main Carpathian ridge, and is bounded 
to the south by the middle reaches of the Danube. It has three natural gateways 




-one at Vienna from the west, another through the Iron Gates from the east, and 
a third through the Moravian Gap from the north. Its well-watered pastures 
offered a natural terminus for nomads moving from east to west, and a 
convenient springboard for many a barbarian tribe preparing to invade the 
Roman Empire. It was the home successively of the Gepids, the Huns (from 
whom it took the name of Hungaria), the Avars, the Cumans, the Slavs, and 
eventually the Magyars. The Magyars call it the Alfold (Lowland), and 
sometimes the puszta> a word of Slav origin meaning 'the wilderness'. 

2. The Mountains. The central feature of the Peninsula is to be found in the 
majestic chain of mountains which curve in two elegant arcs from the Maritime 
Alps in Provence to the Carpathian Alps in Transylvania. This impressive barrier 
forms the Peninsula's backbone, creating a watershed which divides the northern 
Plain from the Mediterranean lands. The highest peaks in the westerly sections- 
Mont Blanc (4,807 m), the Matterhorn (4,478 m), or Gran Paradiso (4,061 m)- 
are significantly higher than those in the more easterly ranges-Triglav (2,863 
m) in the Julian Alps, Gerlach (2,655 m) in the Tatras, or Moldoveanu (2,543 m) 
in Romania. Even so, with the eternal snows lying above the 3,200-m line on the 
south-facing Sonnenseite or 'sunshine side', and above the 2,500-m contour on 
the north-facing slopes, the upper ridges are impassable almost everywhere. 
Continental Europe's largest glacier, the Aletsch, which runs beneath the 
Jungfrau in the Bernese Oberland, has no equivalent in the East. But all the 
highest passes are closed by snow during the winter months. For well over 1,200 
miles there are only three significant gaps in the chain-the Danube Gap in 
Bavaria, the Elbe Gap in Bohemia, and the Moravian Gap which links Silesia 
with Hungary. 

For obvious reasons, the peoples who settled in the high valleys kept 
themselves aloof from the turbulent affairs of the lowlands, regarding their 
mountain home as a refuge and fortress to be defended against all intruders. 
Switzerland, which emerged in the thirteenth century as a confederation of 
mountain cantons (see p. 404), has retained something of this outlook to the 
present day. [alpij 

The mountains, however, have had a unifying as well as a divisive function. 
The critical distances across them are not very great. Bourg St Maurice on the 
Isere and Martigny on the Rhone are, respectively, only 62 and 88 km (39 and 55 
miles) from Italian Aosta. Austrian Innsbruck is 68 km from Bressanone 



(Brixen) in South Tirol; Sambor on the Dniester is 105 km from Uzhgorod, on a 
tributary of the Danube. Once the high alpine passes were tamed, the lands on 
either side of the ridge acquired common links, common interests, and to a large 
degree a common culture. Turin, for example, is much closer to Lyons and 
Geneva than it is to Rome. Milan or Venice have had stronger ties with Zurich, 
Munich, or Vienna than with distant Sicily. Bavaria, which was long cut off from 
the north by the vast forests and hills of central Germany, has shared much with 
nearby Lombardy. The old province of Galicia on the northern slopes of the 
Carpathians had much to do with Hungary over the ridge to the south. As any 
tourist can see, the worlds of the Alpenraum or of the Carpathians have survived, 
notwithstanding the barriers created by modern national states, [gotthard] 

The presence of the mountains gave special significance to the three major 
gaps between them. The Bavarian Gap, which follows the corridor of the middle 
Danube from Passau to Krems, became a capital link between north and south. 
The Elbe Gap opened Bohemia to the German influences which the Bohmer 
Wald might otherwise have impeded. Of equal importance, especially in earlier 
times, was the Moravian Gap, which formed a natural south-bound funnel for 
many of the peoples coming from the steppes. In early medieval times it 
provided the site of the first Slav state, the Great Moravian Empire (see Chapter 
IV). In historic times it has provided a pathway for innumerable armies, for 
Sobieski bound for the Turkish Wars or for Napoleon bound for Austerlitz. It 
ultimately leads, like the routes through the Bavarian and the Elbe Gaps, to the 
Danube near Vienna, The heart of the heart of Europe', [slavkov] 

Of course, Europe possesses many mighty mountain chains in addition to its 
central spine. Mulhacen (3,487 m) in the Sierra Nevada, Le Pic de Nethou or 
d'Aneto (3,404 m) in the Pyrenees, Mt Etna (3,323 m) in Sicily, Monte Corno 
(2,912 m) in the Apennines, Musala (2,925 m) in Bulgaria, Korab (2,764 m) in 
Albania, and Olympus itself (2,917 m) are all peaks of alpine proportions. Not 
all Europeans are aware that the supreme summit of the Peninsula is to be found, 
not on Mont Blanc, but on the Elbrus Massif (5,642 m) in the Greater Caucasus. 

3. The Mediterranean, that marvellously secluded sea which laps Europe's 
southern coastline, forms the basis of a self-contained geographical unit. Its sea 
lanes provide a ready channel for cultural, economic, and political contacts. It 
supplied the cradle for the classical world. Under the Caesars it became in effect 
a Roman lake. In the Renaissance and after, it was the focus of an interwoven 



civilization with important material as well as cultural dimensions.- Yet 
significantly, since the decline of Roman power, the Mediterranean has never 
been politically united. Seapower has never been sufficient to overcome the 
land-based empires which established themselves on its perimeter. Indeed, once 
the Muslim states took root in the Levant and in Africa, the Mediterranean 
became an area of permanent political division. Maritime and commercial 
powers such as Venice were incapable of uniting the whole. The European 
powers of the nineteenth century founded colonies from Syria to Morocco; but 
they were prevented by their rivalries from destroying the principal Muslim 
bastion in Turkey, and hence from creating a general hegemony. 


ALPI 

Contrary to first appearances, the high alpine valleys provided an 
excellent environment for early colonization and primitive agriculture. They 
possessed an abundance of sunshine, fresh water, fuel, building materials, 
pasture, and most importantly, security. Their remoteness was one of their 
assets. They were inhabited from the earliest times, and, as Hannibal 
discovered in the fourth century bc, fiercely defended. Traces of hearths 
found in the Drachenloch cave at 2,445 m in Switzerland's Tamina Valley 
date from the Riss-Wurm interglacial. Evidence of transhumance goes back 
12,000 years. Roman building works and settlements were well established, 
especially in Val d'Aosta and the mining district of Noricum. 1 Villages 
perched on impregnable rocks, such as those in the Alpes Maritimes and 
Haute-Provence, were immune from bandits, invaders, and tax-collectors. 

In medieval times, many alpine communities established a distinct 
political independence. The Swiss cantons are not the only example. The 52 
communes of Brian^on obtained a charter of liberties in 1343, six years 
before the Dauphin of Vienne sold the rest of his patrimony and his title to 
the King of France. They maintained their self-government until the 
Revolution. 

Other districts avoided close control by the lack of communications. 
Barcelonnette, founded by the Counts of Provence and Barcelona, was ceded 





to France with the Pays d'Ubaye by the Treaty of Utrecht. But it could only 
be approached by a 15-hour mule trek until the permanent road was built in 
1883. The villages of the Gorges du Verdon were not linked to the outside 
world until 1947. The lowest pass in the western Alps, the Col de I'Echelle, 
still does not possess an all-weather road on both sides. 

Many roads were built for strategic reasons. An obelisk atop the 
Montgenevre (1,054 m) announces in French, Latin, Italian, and Spanish that 
the route was opened for carriages in 1807 'while the Emperor Napoleon 
was triumphing over his enemies on the Oder and Vistula'. The highest road 
in Europe, over the Col du Gabbier (3,242 m) was built in the 1930s as part 
of France's frontier defences. 

The Alpenraum was exploited most intensively in the second half of the 
nineteenth century, when mixed farming was pushed to high altitudes, and 
the rural population rose dramatically. Yet the advent of modern 
communications provoked a mass exodus, reflected in the old Savoyard 
complaint: Toujours ma chevre monte et ma femme descend. (My goat is 
always going up, and my wife going down.) The trend was reaching crisis 
proportions in many localities until the growth of hydroelectricity and mass 
tourism, especially winter skiing, after 1945. 2 

The antiquity and peculiarities of alpine life have inspired a wealth of 
specialized museums. The doyen is the Museo della Montagna, founded in 
1874 in Turin. The Ethnographic Museum at Geneva, like many smaller 
ones, specializes in the tools, buildings, ceramic stoves, and folk art of alpine 
communities. 


GOTTHARD 

The St Gotthard Pass commands the shortest passage across the central 
Alps. It can fairly claim to be Europe's most vital artery. By joining the 
valley of the Reuss, which flows northward into the Rhine, and the valley of 
the Ticino, which flows southwards into the Po, it provides the most direct 
link between southern Germany and northern Italy. At 2,108 m. it is 




significantly lower than its main rivals, which stay closed for longer periods 
during winter and bad weather. (See Appendix III, p. 1219.) 

It is interesting that the St Gotthard route did not become a major 
thoroughfare until relatively late. It was not developed by the Romans, who 
preferred the more westerly passes, especially the Great St Bernard, the 
Mons Jovis. Nor was it used during the centuries after the fall of the Roman 
Empire in the West, despite the constant migrations from north to south. The 
problem lay with a short section of the upper Reuss valley, which for some 
three miles north of the modern Andermatt enters a precipitous rocky 
canyon. This Schollenen Gorge, whose upper entrance is lined with sheer 
cliffs, was sufficient to defy all traffic until extensive engineering works 
were undertaken. The works began some time after ad 1200. The entrance to 
the gorge was spanned by the magnificent single arch of the Devil's Bridge, 
whose lofty construction must have been no less demanding than the vault of 
a Gothic cathedral. At the steepest passage of the defile, rock-steps known as 
scaliones or Schollen were cut into the cliff, together with supports for the 
wooden platforms which were suspended alongside the overhangs. By ad 
1300, when the hospice at the summit of the pass was dedicated to St 
Gotthard, Bishop of distant Hildesheim, it is clear that the flow of travellers 
had become steady and regular. 

For nearly 600 summers the St Gotthard road served from June to 
November as Europe's premier north-south trail. From Altdorf at the head of 
Lake Lucerne to Biasca at the head of the Levantina, the stream of pilgrims, 
merchants, and soldiers faced 60 miles of rough climbing over four or five 
stages. The southern approach, through the eerie Valle Tremola or 'Valley of 
Trembling', the source of the translucent mineral called tremo-lite, was 
hardly less daunting than the Devil's Bridge. The zigzag path could only be 
negotiated by pack mules, by litters, and by foot travellers. Before the 
widening of the track in 1830, the only person to cross the pass in a wheeled 
vehicle was the Englishman Charles Greville, who won a bet in 1775 by 
paying a team of Swiss guides to carry his phaeton on their shoulders all the 
way. 

The opening of the St Gotthard had important strategic consequences. It 
gave a particular stimulus to the Swiss district of Uri, the guardian of the 
pass, and hence to the Swiss Confederation as a whole. It enabled armies to 
march swiftly from Germany to Lombardy and back, a facility exploited by 



numerous emperors, and most notably by General Suvorov's Russians in 
1799. 

The construction of the St Gotthard railway in 1882 was no less 
remarkable than that of the St Gotthard road. It required a main tunnel of 15 
km. under the summit, together with 80 others. At the famous Pfaffensprimg 
or 'Parson's Leap' above Goschenen, trains enter the spiral trackway 
travelling right and emerge several hundred feet higher up travelling left. It 
cost the lives of many workmen, among them its designer. The railway 
tunnel has been joined since 1980 by a 16.5 km motorway tunnel, which 
carries six lanes of vehicles in all weathers and all seasons. Motor cyclists, 
who hug their machines as they themselves are hugged by leather-suited pil- 
lionesses, scream over the pass in minutes. 

Yet modern travellers who stop by the Devil's Bridge can see a curious 
monument built into the rock beneath the modern viaduct. The inscription, in 
Tsarist Cyrillic, may be translated: to the valiant companions of field 

MARSHAL COUNT SUVOROV-RIMNITSKY, PRINCE OF ITALY, WHO LOST THEIR LIVES 

during the march across the alps in 1799. 2 Raised on the centenary of that 
march, it is a suitable reminder both of the unity of Europe and of the 
grandeur of its mountains. 


Political disunity may well explain some of the cultural unities which persist 
across state frontiers in the Mediterranean. One deep-rooted feature has been 
found in the existence of'parallel authorities', such as that of the Mafia in 
southern Italy, which defy all efforts to suppress them. 2 For most of recorded 
history, the peoples inhabiting the northern shores of the Mediterranean have 
outnumbered their southern neighbours by at least two to one, and hence have 
played a dominant role. A demographic explosion in North Africa promises to 
upset the traditional balance. In any case, the 'Mediterranean lands' have never 
been confined to the countries on the immediate shoreline. In Europe, the 
Mediterranean watershed lies far to the north, taking in Bavaria, Transylvania, 
and Ukraine. No power or culture, not even Rome, has ever united all of these. 

Similar patterns are observable in the history of Europe's other enclosed seas 
-the Baltic and the Black Sea. The Baltic came to prominence at a relatively 
late date. It was the focus in Hansa times for German commercial expansion, and 
in the seventeenth century for Sweden's bid for glory. Yet no single Baltic power 





ever achieved the long dreamt-of dominium marts. German, Swedish, Danish, 

Polish, and Russian rivalry has kept the Baltic disunited to the present day.- 
[HANSA] 

The Black Sea-first known to the ancients as the Axenos or 'Inhospitable', 
later as the Euxine or 'Hospitable' and then as the Pontus-is the 
Mediterranean's Siamese twin. It has passed through phases of Greek, Roman, 
Byzantine, and Ottoman dominance. Yet there again, the rise of a major 
landpower in Russia led to lasting divisions. Until the 1990s, the Soviet Union 
and its satellites faced NATO's southern flank in Turkey across hostile waters. 
More seriously, perhaps, much of the Black Sea is anoxic-that is, it is so 
heavily impregnated with hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) that 'its depths form the 
largest mass of lifeless water in the world'. If'turnover' of the water strata were 
to occur, it would provoke 'the worst natural cataclysm to strike the earth since 
the last Ice Age'. 2 

Since undisputed command of Europe's seas has proved impossible, special 
attention has inevitably been given to their three strategic gateways. The Straits 
of Gibraltar, the Dardanelles, and the Danish Sound have handed inordinate 
power and influence to the states that control them, [sund] 

4. The mainland trunk of the Peninsula is amplified by several large sub¬ 
peninsulas which protrude into the surrounding seas. One such mountainous 
promontory, Scandinavia, adjoins the Baltic. Three others-Iberia, Italy, and the 
Balkan massif-adjoin the Mediterranean. Two more-Crimea and Caucasus- 
adjoin the Black Sea. Each of them, though physically joined to the Continent, 
has more readily been approached by sea than by land. 


SUND 

Like its southern counterpart at the Straits of Gibraltar, the Danish Sound . 
has been called Europe's jugular vein. Controlling the sole point of entry to a 
major sea, it possessed immense strategic and commercial value. 1 Its 
potential was first realized in 1200, when King Canute VI of Denmark 
imprisoned some Liibeck merchants until they paid for the right of passage 






into the Baltic herring grounds. From then on, the Sound Dues were exacted 
for as long as the Danes could enforce them. They were accepted by other 
medieval Baltic powers such as Poland, the Teutonic State, and the Hansa, 
and survived Sweden's challenge in the seventeenth century. They declined 
after 1732, but continued in being until the Redemption Treaty of 1857 when 
British naval power finally persuaded the Danes to commute their ancient 
interest. Even then, the Sound remained important until Prussia acquired 
Kiel in 1866 and by-passed the Sound by building the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal 
(1895). Once aeroplanes could overfly them, all maritime straits, including 
the English Channel, lost much of their strategic significance. All that is left 
is the memory of greatness, a ferry crossing, and the shade of Hamlet's 
Ghost on the battlements at Elsinore. 


Scandinavia, once the site of the shrinking European ice-cap, could never 
support a large population. But its wild, western fiords are tempered by the Gulf 
Stream; the mountains are rich in minerals; and the morainic lakes left by the 
retreating ice are abundant in fish. What the Scandinavians lack in terms of 
climate, they have gained from a secure home base. 

The Iberian Peninsula consists largely of a lofty tableland, separated from 
the rest of the Continent by the high peaks of the Pyrenees. Its eastern seaboard 
forms part of the Mediterranean world, and in early times was drawn 
successively into the Carthaginian, Roman, and Muslim spheres. But much of 
the arid interior is drawn through the valleys of the Douro, the Tagus, and the 
Guadalquivir towards the Atlantic. Hence, in modern times whilst Aragon 
expanded eastward into the Mediterranean, Portugal and Castile moved 
confidently to the western ocean. They were Europe's first colonial powers, and 
they once divided the world between them. 

Italy is the most perfect of peninsulas. The alpine barrier to the north is 
seamless. The plain of the Po forms a rich natural larder. The long, craggy 'leg 
and toe' shelter a large number of fertile, impregnable valleys with ready access 
to the sea. Some of these Italian localities have been rich and extrovert; one of 
them, Rome, gave rise to the largest empire of the ancient world. But after 
Rome's decline they could so defend their independence that Italy was not 
reunited again for almost 2,000 years. 

The Balkan Peninsula is far less welcoming than Italy. Its interior is more 




arid; the mountains, from the Dinaric Alps to the Rhodopes, more stony; the 
valleys more remote, the sea less accessible. Its main function in history has 
been to preserve the tenacious communities which cling to its soil, and which 
block the direct passage between the Mediterranean and the Danube Basin. 

The peninsularity of Crimea -formerly known as Taurus-was emphasized 
by its hinterland on the Ukrainian steppe, which was not permanently settled 
until recent times. It looks to the sea, the sun, and the south, and formed part of 
successive east Mediterranean civilizations until conquered by the Russian 
Empire in 1783. [chersonesos] 

The Caucasus, too, has many peninsular characteristics. Although it is 
physically joined to land at both ends, to Europe in the north and to Asia in the 
south, the mountains which ring it on the landward side are so massive that its 
activities have inevitably been channelled seawards. The ridge of the Greater 
Caucasus, which tops 18,000 ft (5,486 m), is significantly higher than the Alps 
or the Carpathians. The Lesser Caucasus to the south attains a similar elevation 
on Mt Ararat (16,786 ft or 5,165 m). The inhabitants of the Caucasus are 
Eurasians in more senses than one. [Caucasia] 

5. Europe was endowed by Nature with ten thousand islands. The largest of them 
-Iceland, Ireland, Great Britain, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, and Crete-have 
been able at various times to develop distinct cultures and political entities of 
their own. One sceptred isle, in exceptional circumstances and for a very brief 
period, was able to amass the largest empire in world history. They are all part of 
Europe, yet physically and psychologically separate. As the twin slots on the 
post-boxes in Messina and Syracuse rightly indicate, there are two different 
worlds- Sicilia and Continente. 

Many of the lesser islands, from Spitzbergen to Malta, stand like watchmen 
in the lonely sea. But others are grouped in comforting archipelagos that support 
a sense of mutual interest and identity. The Shetlands, Orkneys, and Hebrides off 
Great Britain; the Balearios off Catalonia, and, above all, the Ionians, the 
Sporades, the Cyclades, and the Dodecanese off Greece all have their collective 
as well as their individual characters, [Faroe] 

Nowadays, however, insularity is shrinking fast. Great Britain, for example, 
built its overseas empire in an era when naval power could provide effective 
insulation from continental affairs. But the same degree of separation is no 
longer possible. Naval power has been superseded by aeroplanes, and aeroplanes 



by ICBMs, that render surface features such as the English Channel almost 
irrelevant. The British Empire has disappeared, and Britain's dependence on her 
continental neighbours has correspondingly increased. The opening of the 
Channel Tunnel in 1994 was an event of more than symbolic importance. It 
marked the end of Britain's island history. 

Given the principal divisions of the Peninsula, three sub-regions have gained 
functions of particular importance: the Midi, the Danube Basin, and the Volga 
corridor. 

The Midi or 'South' of modern France abuts the Mediterranean coast 
between the Pyrenees and the Alps. For anyone cruising the Mediterranean, it 
offers the only painless passage to the northern Plain. A landing in the Midi 
offers the immediate prospect of an easy journey to the main part of the 
Continent. From ancient Marseille, or from Aries at the mouth of the Rhone, one 
can move without hindrance either across the lowland of Fanguedoc to the 
Atlantic or round the flank of the Massif Central to the headwaters of the Foire 
and the Seine. The Rhone's main tributary, the Saone, leads straight to the 
Belfort Gap and a gentle descent to the Rhine. At every other point between 
Gibraltar and the Dardanelles, the early northbound traveller would be faced 
with alpine passes, dead ends, or lengthy detours. 

The felicitous location of the Midi, bridgeland between the Mediterranean 
and the Plain, had important consequences. It provided the most effective setting 
for the fusion of the ancient civilization of the south with the 'barbarian' cultures 
of the north. For the Romans it offered, as Cisalpine Gaul, the first major 
province beyond Italy. For the Franks, the first of the barbarians to establish a 
major empire of their own, it offered the promise of the sun, and of high culture. 
They established a foothold in ad 537, a century after the fall of Roman power, 
and never let go. The resultant Kingdom of France, partly northern, partly 
Mediterranean, developed the most influential and the most universal culture of 
the Continent. 

The Danube Basin, like the Midi, links the Plain with the Mediterranean; but 
in this case the link lies west-east. The Danube rises in the Black Forest, crosses 
the mountain line in the Bavarian Gap at Passau, and flows east for 1,500 miles 
to the Black Sea. For peoples approaching from the east it offered the simplest 
route to the interior; for the peoples of the Plain, the most tempting itinerary to 
the southern seas. For most of its length, it constituted the principal frontier line 
of the Roman Empire and hence of 'civilization'. In modern times, its catchment 



area supplied the territorial base for the great multinational empire of the 
Habsburgs, and the scene for the principal confrontation in Europe between 
Christianity and Islam, [danuvius] 


FAROE 

Of all Europe's many islands, none can match the lonely grandeur of the 
Faroes, whose high black basalt cliffs rise from the stormy North Atlantic 
midway between Iceland, Norway, and Scotland. Seventeen inhabited 
islands, centred on Stremoy and the principal harbour of Torshavn, support a 
modern population of 45,464 (1984), mainly from fishing. Descended from 
Norsemen who settled in the eighth century, the Faroese answered to the 
Gulatmg, the assembly of western Norway, and to their own local Loegting. 
[ding] Their language is a dialect of Norwegian; but they have their own 
sagas, their own poets and artists, their own culture. Yet from 1814, when 
Norway was annexed to Denmark, 'Europe's smallest democracy' was 
subjected to a Danish governor and to Danish interests. 

As a result, the Faroese national movement came to be directed against 
Denmark, 'the one Scandinavian country with which they have least in 
common'. 1 In this the Faroese followed in the steps of Iceland, aiming above 
all to preserve their identity. The big moment came in June 1940, when, with 
Copenhagen under Nazi occupation, a British warship ordered a Torshavn 
skipper to hoist the Faroese flag in place of the Danish one. The referendum 
of 1946, which opted for unlimited sovereignty, preceded the compromise 
settlement of 1 April 1948. Faroe accepted home rule within the Danish 
realm. In 1970 it was granted independent membership of the Nordic 
Council. The Norourlandahusio or 'Nordic House' in Torshavn was built 
with Swedish wood, Norwegian slate, Danish glass, and Icelandic roofing, 
and was equipped with Finnish furniture. 


Of all the bridgelands, however, none is more vital than that through which 
the Volga flows. By modern convention, the Continental divide is taken to lie on 






the line of the Ural Mountains and the Ural River. To the west of the Ural, in the 
Volga Basin, one is in Europe; to the east of the Ural, in Siberia or Kazakhstan, 
one is in Asia. On the banks of the Volga, therefore, at Saratov or Tsaritsyn, one 
stands truly at the gate. For the Volga marks the first European station on the 
highroad of the steppe; and it fills the corridor which joins the Baltic with the 
Caspian. Until the seventeenth century the Volga also happened to coincide with 
the limit of Christian settlement, and hence with an important cultural boundary. 
It is Europe's largest river, and a worthy guardian of the Peninsula which 
stretches 'from the Atlantic to the Urals'. 


DANUVIUS 

In ancient times, the River Danube represented one of the great dividing I 
lines of the European Peninsula. Established as the frontier of the Roman 
Empire in the 1st century ad, the Latin Danuvius, or Greek Ister divided 
civilization from barbarity. 

In later times, however, the Danube was to develop into one of Europe's 
major thoroughfares, an open boulevard linking West and East. 1 In Bernini's 
famous composition for the Fountain of the Four Rivers in the Piazza 
Navona in Rome, it is the Danube which is taken to personate Europe 
alongside Africa's Nile, Asia's Ganges, and America's Plate. 

In its upper reaches, as the Donau, the river flows through the heart of 
the Germanic world. A plaque in the Fiirstenberg Park at Donaueschingen in 
the Black Forest marks its source: HIER ENTSPRINGT DIE DONAU. 
Passing the castle of Sigmaringen, home of the Hohenzollerns, the river 
passes Ulm and Regensburg, chief cities of the Holy Roman Empire, and 
after Passau enters the 'eastern realm' of Oesterreich. In Austria, it guided 
the route of the [nibelung]. It passes Linz, where the Emperor Frederick III 
was buried under his motto of A-E-I-O-U, meaning Austria erit in orbe 
ultima-, Amstetten, where Franz Ferdinand is buried; Kierling, where Kafka 
died; and Eisenstadt, which is Haydn's last resting-place: 

Himmel habe Dank! (Heaven, receive our thanks! 

E in harmonischer Gesang My life's course 

War mein Lebenslauf Was one harmonious hymn.) 




Vienna, as Metternich remarked, is where 'Europe' meets 'Asia'. 

In its middle reaches as the Duna, the broadening stream enters Hungary, 
the land of the Magyars driven like a wedge through the lands of the Slavs 
on either side. At Bratislava/Pozsony/Pressburg, it laps the sometime capital 
of 'Upper Hungary', now the capital of the Slovakian Republic. Fertood was 
the site of the Eszterhazy's 'second Versailles'; Esztergom, the home of the 
Hungarian Primates. Szentendre (St Andrew), once a refuge for Serbian 
exiles, is now a mecca for bohemian artists. At Buda and Pest, a Turkish 
Castle on one bank faces an English-style Parliament on the other, [buda] 

In the lower reaches, beyond the Iron Gates, the river flows from 
Catholicism into Orthodoxy, [nikopolis] is where Wulfila translated the 
Greek bible into Gothic, 'the starting-point of Germanism', [biblia] 
Romania on the left side claims to be a descendant of Trajan's Dacia. Serbia 
and Bulgaria on the right bank, long occupied by the Ottomans (who called 
it the Tuna), were founded on top of Byzantine provinces. Chileavecche was 
once a Genoese outpost. The last landing-stage is at Sulina in the Delta, in 
Europe's largest bird reserve, in a world not of civilization but of eternal 
Nature. 2 

Rivers to the geographer are the bearers of sediment and trade. To the 
historian they are the bearers of culture, ideas, and sometimes conflict. 3 
They are like life itself. For 2,888 kilometres from Donaueschingen to the 
Delta, the flow never stops. 


Environmental change is taken for granted in all aspects of physical geography. 
Yet traditional disciplines such as geology give the impression that the pace of 
change is so slow as to be marginal within the human time-frame. Only recently 
has the realization dawned that the modern environment is far less fixed than 
was once supposed. 

Climate, for example, is constantly on the move. In Civilisation and Climate 
(1915), the American scholar Ellsworth Huntington published the fruits of his 
ingenious research into the giant redwoods of California. It was the starting- 
point of historical climatology. Since the redwoods can live for more than 3,000 
years, and since the annual rings of their trunks vary in size according to the 




warmth and humidity of every year that passes, the cross-section of a redwood 
trunk provides a systematic record of climatic variations over three millennia. 
Huntington's technique, now called dendrochronology, inspired a 'pulsatory 
theory' of alternating climatic phases which could be applied to the past of all 
the continents. This in turn produced a special brand of environmental 
determinism. The growth of classical civilization in the Mediterranean could be 
attributed to the onset of a moist phase which permitted the cultivation of wheat 
in North Africa, for instance, whilst northern Europe floundered under an 
excessive deluge of rain, fog, and frost. The decline of the ancient world could 
be attributed to a climatic shift in the opposite direction, which brought 
Mediterranean sunshine north of the Alps. The migrations of the Mongols, 
which directly affected the history both of China and of Europe (see pp. 364-6), 
could be attributed to an extended drought in the oases of Central Asia. In his 
later work, The Mainsprings of Civilisation (1945), Huntington explored other 
factors of the physical environment such as diet and disease, and their interplay 
with human heredity.- Crude linkages gave the subject a bad name, and 
attempts have since been made to refine the earlier findings. 

Nevertheless, periodicity theories continue to have their advocates. 
'Cyclomania' is not yet dead: the rise and fall of civilizations has been linked to 
everything from sunspots to locust swarms. Whatever their particular preference, 
scholars are bound to be drawn to the phenomenon of environmental variation, 
and to its impact on human affairs. After all, it is a matter of simple fact that 
climate does vary. Parts of the Roman world which once supported a flourishing 
population now find themselves in desert wasteland. Viking graves were once 
dug in plots in Iceland and Greenland, which permafrost renders impenetrable to 
pick or shovel. In the seventeenth century, annual fairs were held on the winter 
ice of the Thames in London; and armies marched across the frozen Baltic in 
places where similar ventures would now be suicidal. The European 
environment is not a fixed entity, even if its subtler rhythms cannot always be 
exactly measured, [vendange] 

Arnold Toynbee's A Study of History (1933-9), which offered a 
comprehensive theory of the growth, breakdown, and disintegration of 
civilizations, is but the most prominent of environmental histories. After 
discussing the genesis of civilizations in terms of mankind's response to the 
'challenge of the environment', he propounds his law on 'the virtues of 
adversity'. The Roman Campagna, the semi-desert of Judah, the sandy wastes of 
Brandenburg, and the hostile shore of New England are all cited as dour 


environments that have generated a vigorous response. One might add the 
backwoods of Muscovy. After outlining 'the stimuli of blows, pressures, and 
penalisations', he comes to the concept of the 'golden mean.' If the Slavs in 
Eastern Europe suffered from a lack of early stimuli, the Celts and the 
Scandinavians suffered from excessive adversity. According to Toynbee, the 
nearest thing to ideal conditions was experienced by the Hellenic civilization of 
ancient Greece-'the finest flower of the species that has ever yet come to 
bloom'. - 

Nowadays, though the impact of the environment on man is by no means 
discounted, special attention is also paid to the impact of man on the 
environment, [eco] Historical ecology emerged as an academic subject well 
before the onset of the 'greenhouse effect' alerted everyone to its importance. It 
calls on a wide range of technological wizardry. Aerial archaeology has 
revolutionized our knowledge of the prehistoric landscape. Sedimentology, 
which studies the patterns of riverine deposits, and glaciology, which studies the 
patterns of ice formation in glaciers, have been mobilized to give new precision 
to environmental change over centuries and millennia. Geochemical analysis, 
which measures tell-tale phosphates in the soil of ancient habitations, has given 
archaeologists another potent tool. Palynology, or pollen analysis, which 
analyses ancient grains preserved in the earth, permits the reconstruction of 
former plant-life spectra. Specialists debate the evidence for 'the great elm 
decline', for the crops of prehistoric agriculture, or for the chronology of forest 
clearances. Peat analysis, which depends on the composition and rate of 
accumulation of peat bogs, has identified five major climatic 'deteriorations' in 
the period between 3000 bc and ad 1000. The science of prehistory has moved 
far from the time when archaeologists could only dig objects out of the earth, 
and struggle to match their finds with fragmentary references in the writings of 
the ancients. [cl4] 

Today's prehistorians also place great emphasis on the processes of 
prehistoric social change. Time was when almost all new cultural phenomena 
were explained in terms of human migration. The emergence of new burial 
practices, of new rites, of new artefacts, or of a new language group was 
automatically linked to the presumed arrival of new peoples. Now, though 
prehistoric migrations are not discounted, it is well understood that material and 
cultural changes can be explained in terms of evolution within existing 
populations. Technological advances, religious conversions, and linguistic 
evolutions must all be taken into consideration. 


European prehistory has to be related to two chronologies of entirely different 
orders of magnitude. Geological time, which spans the estimated 4,550 million 
years since the formation of the earth, is divided into eras, periods, and epochs 
from the Azoic to the Holocene. Human life, in contrast, is confined to the 
terminal tip of geological time. Its earliest origins occur in Africa in the middle 
of the Pliocene. It reaches Europe in the middle of Pleistocene. It does not move 
into the stage called 'Civilization' until after the end of the Quaternary. Europe 
in its present form is no more than five million years old; and the human 
presence in Europe has not lasted for more than one million years (see Appendix 
III, p. 1215). 


VENDANGE 

Historical climatology relies on records preserved in books, and on 
records preserved by nature herself. The former include diaries, travellers' 
tales, and weather data kept by estate managers, grain merchants, or wine¬ 
growers. The latter involves the study of tree-rings, fossils, sediments, 
stalactites, and glaciers. 1 

The precision of Nature's own records is amazing, even within historical 
times. The annual deposits of the great Salt Lake in Crimea have been 
logged to 2294 bc. Some of the great stalagmites, such as that in the cave of 
Aven d'Orgnac in the Jura, are over 7,000 years old. Variations in the density 
of their calcite deposits faithfully reflect historical rainfall patterns. 

Phenology is the study of fruit-ripening, and has been widely exploited 
in relation to the history of wine-harvests. Every year for centuries, many 
French vineyards issued a public proclamation of the date for commencing 
the collection of grapes. An early date signified a sunny growing season; a 
late date signified a cool season. By listing the dates of the premiere cuvee in 
a particular location, historians can produce complete 'pheno-logical series' 
over very long periods. By collating the phenological series for different 
locations, they can work out the mean seasonal date for each region. These 
courbes de vendanges or 'wine-harvest curves' present precise indications of 
climatic change. 2 (See Appendix III, p. 1220.) 




The movement of glaciers provides another source of information. 
Glaciers advance in periods of cold, and retreat in periods of relative 
warmth. What is more, the length of Europe's alpine glaciers in any 
particular year can often be established from eyewitness accounts, from old 
prints, or from official records. Archives such as those of the Chambre des 
Comptes de Savoie contain inspectors' reports on glacial advances which 
destroyed villages or prevented the inhabitants from paying their tithes and 
taxes. In 1600, for example, a year of disaster at Chamonix, people on both 
the French and Italian side of Mont Blanc lived in fear for their future. 
Detailed studies of the Mer de Glace, of the Rhonegletscher in the Valais, or 
the Vernagt in Tyrol, all of whose termini in the late sixteenth century stood 
several kilometres below their current position, demonstrate the reality of 
Europe's 'Little Ice Age'. Periods of glacial maxima peaked in 1599-1600, 
1640-50, 1680, 1716-20, and 1770. In 1653 local people defiantly placed a 
statue of St Ignatius at the base of the Aletsch glacier; and the glacier 
stopped. The contemporary glacial retreat has continued since 1850. 3 

Climatic data are most convincing when different sources produce the 
same results. Wildly fluctuating weather in the 1530s, for example, is 
confirmed both by tree-rings from Germany, and by the Franco-Swiss 
vendanges (see Appendix III). The coldest year for Europe's vineyards 
occurred in 1816. Collection of the ruined grapes began in eastern France on 
All Saints Day (1 November). Mary Shelley, vacationing in nearby 
Switzerland, could not even go out for walks. Instead, she stayed indoors, 
and invented Frankenstein. 


C14 

4o ,000 years is the length of time within which isotopes of Carbonl4 show 
measurable signs of radioactivity. This means that radiocarbon dating 
methods can be applied to organic materials from the late palaeolithic to the 
recent past. 35,000 bc is approximately the date when the Neanderthals died 
out and when humans lived at Cromagnon. 

The value of C14, whose exploitation gave rise to a Nobel prize for 




chemistry in 1960, derives from the spontaneous and steady rate of its decay. 
It is the only one of three carbon isotopes to be radioactive, and it 
accumulates in all living matter through the action of cosmic rays on the 
atmosphere. It is present in bones, body tissue, shells, meat, hair, rope, cloth, 
wood, and many other materials which abound on archaeological sites. It 
starts to decay as soon as the organism dies, and continues to do so over a 
half-life of 5,730 years and a mean life of c.8,033 years. A 1 per cent 
decrease can be measured to c.80 years. 

The calibration of results is fraught with variables. But it has been 
greatly improved in recent years by the discovery of complementary 
techniques that provide a basis for comparison. Thermoluminescence (TL) 
and electron spin resonance (ESR), for example, detect minute changes 
caused by natural radioactivity in the crystal lattice of minerals, and are 
specially effective in dating ceramics. The examination of carbon isotopes 
by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) has extended the chronological 
range to c. 100,000 years, throwing doubt on previous age estimates of the 
oldest humanoid remains. 1 

After three decades of development, radiocarbon dating has been used to 
construct impressive data collections. Archaeologists of the mesolithic, for 
instance, can consult catalogues which list the dates of finds from all over 
Europe. A piece of linear beaded pottery from Eitzum in Lower Saxony is 
dated 6480 ± 210; charcoal from a site at Vlasac in Serbia, 7930 ± 77; a 
charred pine-branch from Calowanie near Warsaw, 10,030 ± 120. 2 Every 
new measurement consolidates the overall picture. 

The most sensational challenge for C14, however, arose with the dating 
of the Turin Shroud. Supposedly brought to Europe from the Holy Land in 
the fourteenth century, the shroud bears the faint impression of a dead man's 
face and body, and had been venerated as a relic of the Crucifixion. Tests 
undertaken in 1988-9 showed that the cloth of the shroud had been 
manufactured between ad 1260 and 1390. But they did not explain the dead 
man's image. 3 


On the scale of geological time, the formation of the European Peninsula 
must be counted as a recent event. Eighty million years ago most of the land that 




was destined to constitute Europe lay half-submerged in a scattered archipelago 
of mid-ocean islands. After that, as the Adantic opened up to its fullest extent, 
the drifting African plate closed the ocean gap from the south. Five million years 
ago Africa was still directly joined to Eurasia, with the Alps and the Atlas 
mountains piled high on either side of the dry Mediterranean trench. But then 
'the natural dam at Gibraltar broke'. 'A gigantic waterfall of sea-water, one 
hundred times the size of Victoria Falls' rushed in, and completed the 
Peninsula's familiar outline.- Two final afterthoughts less than ten thousand 
years ago opened up the English Channel and the Danish Sound, thereby 
creating first the British Isles and then the Baltic Sea. 

Over the last million years, the young Peninsula lived through seventeen ice 
ages. At its greatest extent, the ice sheet reached to a line joining North Devon, 
Hanover, Cracow, and Kiev. Humanoid visitors made their appearance during 
the warmer interglacials. The earliest traces of Man in Europe have been found 
at sites near Vertesszolos in Hungary and at Isernia in Italy, both dated 850- 
700,000 bc. At Isernia, Homo erectus ate a varied diet from the fauna of a 
savannah-type countryside. At Terra Amata, on the beach near Nice, a human 
footprint 400,000 years old was found in hard-baked fireside clay. In 1987 a 
cache of fossilized human remains was discovered deep in a cave chamber at 
Atapuerca near Burgos in Spain. 

In the course of the ice ages, human evolution progressed though the stages 
of homo erectus, homo sapiens, and homo sapiens sapiens (modern humankind). 
The remains of a transitional creature were found in a quarry in the Neanderthal 
Valley near Dusseldorf in 1856, thereby provoking the public debate on human 
origins that has continued ever since, [monkey] The Neanderthals, with massive 
bones and short limbs, are thought to have been a specifically European variant 
adapted to glacial conditions. They used flint tools, understood the secret of fire, 
buried their dead, and cared for the living. Their particular brand of'Mousterian' 
stone technology was named after a site in Dordogne. They hunted in organized 
collectives, as shown by the sites at La Cotte de St Brelade on the island of 
Jersey, or more recently at Zwoleri in Poland, which was used over many 
millennia for the entrapment of stampeding horses and mammoths. They passed 
away some 40-35,000 years ago, during the last interglacial. Recent finds at St 
Cesaire have suggested that they survived for a time alongside new immigrants 
who were arriving from Africa and the Middle East.- 

The newcomers were slight in build, but much more dexterous, possessing 


finger-bones only half as thick as those of their predecessors. As shown by 
remains from Sungir in northern Russia, they could thread very fine bone 
needles and could sew clothes. They are widely known as 'cavemen', but caves 
were only one of their habitats. They roamed the plains, hunting bison and 
mammoth and gathering wild plants. At Mezirich in Ukraine, one ice-age 
encampment has survived intact. Its spacious huts were built from hundreds of 
mammoth bones covered with hides, [gat-hunter] 

The end of the last ice age was preceded by the daddy of all volcanic 
explosions. The pressure of the African plate had opened a fault-line running 
along the bed of the Mediterranean; and it created a string of volcanoes, which 
still exist. Some 36,000 years ago the largest of these volcanoes blew its cone, 
leaving a trail of volcanic ash that reached to the Volga. At Pozzuoli, near 
Naples, it left a caldera or crater ring some seven miles wide. It was the 
forerunner of all the great eruptions of historic times-at Thera in 1628 bc (see 
pp. 93-4), at Vesuvius in ad 79 [panta], at Etna in 1669. It is a sobering 
reminder that mankind has always been skating on the fragile crust of its 
geological heritage. 

By convention, the human sector of European prehistory is usually related to 
the 'Three-Age System' of Stone, Bronze, and Iron. The system was first set out 
in 1836 by a Danish antiquary, Christian Thomsen; and it provides a framework 
of time based on the changing implements of primitive man. Hence, the 
palaeolithic (Old Stone Age) refers to the vast period before the end of the ice 
ages when Man worked with chipped stone tools. The mesolithic (Middle Stone 
Age) refers to the much more recent period following the last of the ice, c.8000- 
3000 bc. The two millennia which preceded the Christian or Common Era, 
which forms our own, arbitrary scheme of chronology [anno domini], were 
taken up successively by the neolithic (New Stone Age), the Bronze Age, and 
the Iron Age. Each of these technological 'Ages' can be subdivided into early, 
middle, and late phases. It is essential to remember, however, that the Three-Age 
System is not based on any absolute scale of time. At any given moment, one 
place might have lingered in the neolithic whilst others had reached the Iron 
Age. In any given region, there could be peoples living at different stages of 
development, or using different forms of technology simultaneously. 

The Old Stone Age reached back for a million years. It overlapped with the 
penultimate era of quaternary geological time, the Pleistocene, and with the last 
great glaciations-known respectively as Mindel, Riss, and Wiirm. Apart from 



Neanderthal and Le Moustier, invaluable finds have been made at Cromagnon 
(1868), Grimaldi (1874), Combe-Capelle (1909), Chancelade (1888), and at all 
points between Abbeville and Ojcow, each associated with particular humanoid 
types, periods, or cultures. At Aurignac, Solutre, and Abri La Madeleine, 
sculptures of the human form first appeared in the shape of figurines such as the 
'Venus of Willendorf ' or the 'Venus of Laussel'. With the Magdalenian period, at 
the end of the palaeolithic age when bone tools were in fashion, under the 
shadow of the last ice cap, the high point of cave art was reached. Magnificent 
subterranean galleries have survived at Altamira in Spain (1879) and at Lascaux 
in Dordogne (1940), leading some commentators to talk of a 'Franco-Cantabrian 
School'. In a cave near Menton on the Riviera, a hoard of Cassis rufa shells 
from the Indian Ocean was found. The shells were thought to possess life-giving 
powers, and their presence would seem to confirm both a sophisticated religious 
system and a far-flung trading network.- - [laussel] 


GAT-HUNTER 

The origins of organized political communities, or 'states', have rarely been 
sought before the neolithic period. Some theorists, including Marxists, have 
looked to the tribes and tribal chiefdoms of the Bronze and Iron Ages. 
Others have looked to the neolithic revolution in agriculture and to the 
associated growth of fixed settlement. According to V. Gordon Childe, for 
instance, the preconditions for a state organized on residence, not kinship, 
required territorial authority, surplus capital, symbolic monuments, long¬ 
distance trade, labour specialization, stratified society, scientific knowledge, 
and the art of writing. Such preconditions were first met in Egypt and 
Mesopotamia, and in Europe, in the city-states of ancient Greece (see 
Chapter II). 

Analysis of the complex society of hunter-gatherers, however, projects 
the topic much further back in time. Hunter-gatherers or gatherer-hunters, it 
seems, were not saved by the advent of agriculture from the immemorial 
threat of extinction. On the contrary, they enjoyed many millennia of 
'unending leisure and affluence'. They were not unfamiliar with agriculture 
when it arose, but rejected it, except as a marginal or supplementary activity. 





What is more, in the later stages of prehistory they developed social 
structures which permitted differentiated specialization. In addition to the 
far-roaming hunter-warriors and the home-based gatherers, some groups 
could specialize in the new labour-intensive processes of fishing, seafood 
collection, harvesting wild grass and nuts, or bird-trapping. Others were free 
to specialize as organizers or as negotiators in the formation of federations 
and regional alliances. In other words, the hunter-gatherer bands possessed 
an embryonic representative and political class. The historical problem can 
be addressed by analogy with the native peoples of North America, 
Australia, or New Guinea. 

The big question about the hunter-gatherers, therefore, does not seem to 
be 'How did they progress towards the higher level of an agricultural and 
politicised society?' but 'What persuaded them to abandon the secure, well- 
provided and psychologically liberating advantages of their primordial 
lifestyle?'. 1 


LAUSSEL 

The 'Venus of Laussel' dates from c. 19000 bc. It is a bas-relief, sculptured 
on the inner wall of a cave in the Dordogne, and painted with red ochre. It 
shows a seated female figure with no surviving facial features, but with a 
large coiffe of hair drawn behind the shoulder, long pendulant breasts, and 
knees opened wide to display the vulva. The left hand rests on a pregnant 
belly. The crooked right arm holds aloft a crescent-shaped bison horn. 

Like most of the human images of earliest European art, covering over 
90 per cent of human history, the manifestly female gender of this artefact is 
both striking and eloquent. It is widely taken to represent the palaeolithic 
Godhead, a variant of the 'Great Cosmic Mother', whose cult dominated the 
rites of a matriarchal community. According to one interpretation, it would 
have presided over masked ritual dancing, where women, men, and children 
sought mystical communion with the animal spirits. Less certainly, it formed 
the pinnacle of cave-life imagery where the cave was the 'Womb-tomb-maze 
of the Great Earth Mother' and where 'blood-woman- moon-bison horn- 




birth-magic-the cycle of life are analo-gised in a continuous resonance, or 
harmony, of sacred energies.' 1 

The matriarchal, or 'matrifocal' character of prehistoric society has been 
accepted by most theorists, from Marx and Engels onwards. However the 
assumption that matriarchy only operated at the most 'primitive' level is not 
now regarded as valid. In his work on myths, the poet Robert Graves 
explored the origins and fate of matrifocal culture in Europe, tracing the 
decline of woman's status from ancient divinity to classical slavery. 2 

Others have considered the female origins of speech, and hence of 
conscious culture. In humanity's long 'nursery age', women and children 
may conceivably have learned to talk whilst the menfolk were away hunting. 
If so, the gender difference can only have been one of degree, since boy- 
children must surely have learned to verbalize alongside their sisters. 

More convincing is the strong possibility that matriarchal and patriarchal 
societies overlapped, creating a wide range of hybrid forms. If the Gimbutas 
theory is correct (see p. 86), the advance on to the Pontic Steppes of the late 
neolithic 'Kurgan peoples' marked the arrival not only of the Indo- 
Europeans but also of warlike, patriarchal traditions. On the other hand, after 
the subsequent arrival of the Sauromatians-the first wave of the Irano- 
Sarmatian confederation-the matriarchal newcomers began to mingle 
c.3000 BC with their patriarchal predecessors. In this connection, Herodotus 
retailed a curious story how Amazon warriors fled the southern shores of the 
Black Sea and, after mating with Scythian braves, set up a new homeland 
'three days march from the Maeotian Lake'. The story was rejected as sheer 
invention until archaeologists began to uncover the skeletons of female 
warriors in Sauromatian graves. A Sarmatian princess of a still later vintage, 
whose tomb was found at Kolbiakov on the Don, had been buried with her 
battle-axe. 3 

Like every committed doctrine, the feminist approach to 'preherstory' has its 
extravagances. But it is not entirely implausible: 

Because we have separated humanity from nature, subject from object, ... 
and universities from the universe, it is enormously difficult for anyone but a 
poet or a mystic to understand ... the holistic and mythopoeic thought of Ice 
Age humanity. The very language we use ... speaks of tools, hunters, and 



men, when every statue and painting we discover cries out that this Ice Age 
humanity was a culture of art, the love of animals, and women ... Gathering 
is as important as hunting, but only hunting is discussed. Storytelling is 
discussed, but the storyteller is a hunter rather than an old priestess of the 
moon. Initiation is imagined, but the initiate is not the young girl in 
menarche about to wed the moon, but a young man about to become a great 
hunter. 4 

Western civilization, however defined, is generally thought to have its roots 
in the Judaeo-Christian tradition and in the Classical World. Both those 
source cultures, whether of Yehovah or of Zeus-Jupiter, were dominated by 
male Godheads. Yet one should not forget that through eons of earlier time 
the Godhead was female. One can only presume that humankind, so long as 
it was a tiny vulnerable species, was more moved by the feminine role of 
generation and birth than by the male role of killing and death. 

All sorts of people have dreamed of a long-lost paradise in the remote 
past. Romantics, nationalists, and Marxists have all had their idealized 
Gardens of Eden, their semi-mythical Golden Ages. Now feminists are doing 
the same. 5 One thing is certain. The Venus of Laussel, and others like her, 
was no sex object of male gratification. In fact, she was no Venus at all. 


The Middle Stone Age or mesolithic represents a transitional era when Man 
was adapting to rapidly improving climatic conditions. The terminal moraine of 
the last Finno-Scandinavian ice sheet has been dated to 7300 bc. Technological 
advance was characterized by the appearance of microliths-very small, pointed 
or bladed flints. Greatly increased supplies offish and shellfish encouraged 
settlement along the lakes, rivers, and coasts. Earlier cultures identified in the 
south, as at Mas d'Azil in the Pyrenees, were complemented by more northerly 
ones, such as Maglemose in Zealand or Ertebolle in Jutland, where deep-sea 
fishing emerged. For the first time, the mesolithic stone axe was capable of 
felling the largest trees. 

The New Stone Age, or neolithic, was marked by the transition from food¬ 
gathering to food production. The domestication of plants and animals, 
otherwise known as agriculture, was accompanied by further improvements in 
stone technology, where grinding, polishing, and boring produced implements of 




far superior quality. This 'Neolithic Revolution' began in the Middle East in the 
eighth millennium bc, in northern parts of Europe as late as the second. It saw 
the beginnings of cattle, sheep, and pig-farming; of horse-breeding and of 
hybridization to produce mules; of systematic cereal production; of ploughing, 
weaving, pottery, mining. It also saw the principal drive for the comprehensive 
colonization of the Peninsula, where previously only scattered settlements had 
existed. 

Two main lines of neolithic advance have been identified. One, which is 
associated with the Linearbandkeramik or 'linear pottery', moved rapidly up the 
Danube Valley into central Europe. In a brief spurt of perhaps 700 years in the 
fifth millennium, it crossed the 1,500 miles between present-day Romania and 
the Netherlands. The pioneer settlements clustered round great communal long- 
houses built from the largest timbers of the newly cleared forest. Problems of 
agricultural over-exploitation and of manpower shortages led to temporary 
retreats, followed by the characteristic reoccupation of abandoned sites. A 
second line of advance, associated with the spread of a 'stamped-pottery' culture, 
moved westwards round the Mediterranean shore. In the fourth millennium there 
were further extensions of agricultural settlement into the Peninsula's western 
and northern extremities-into Iberia, France, and Switzerland, the British Isles, 
Scandinavia, and eastern parts of the Great Plain. By c.3200 bc the whole of the 
Peninsula below latitude 62 °N was occupied by various types of a food- 
producing economy.- [gat-hunter] [tammuz] [vino] 

In this era lake villages were built such as those at Charavines near Grenoble, 
at Chalain in the Jura, on the Federsee in Wiirttemberg, or on Lake Zurich. They 
are particularly valuable to archaeologists, since the mud of the lake has acted as 
an almost perfect preservative of everything from kitchen utensils to half-eaten 
apple-cores, [tollund] 

Overall, six principal neolithic zones have been established: an east 
Mediterranean and Balkan zone, under strong influences from the Levant; the 
Tripol'ye-Cucuteni zone on the Ukrainian steppe; the Baltic-Black Sea zone of 
cord-impressed ceramics and of the 'battle-axe' people; the central zone of linear 
ceramics, with its heartland in Bohemia but with outposts west of the Rhine and 
east of the Vistula; the northern zone of the Great Plain, dominated by funnel¬ 
necked beaker ware; and the western zone of the 'bell beaker' people, stretching 
from southern Spain to the British Isles and Scandinavia. Late neolithic cultures 
were often connected with vast megalith constructions varying from simple 


dolmens or menhirs to huge chambered tombs, stone avenues, and stone circles. 
The principal sites are at New Grange (Ireland) and Maes Howe in the Orkneys, 
at Carnac in Brittany, and at Avebury and Stonehenge in Wiltshire. The risky 
suggestion has been made that they owe their development to international 
enterprise, even to contact with Egyptian, or possibly Minoan, metal- 
prospectors, [DASA] [GGANTIJA] 


TAMMUZ 

Tammuz, son of Ishtar or Ashetar, Mother of the Universe, was the Corn 
God of ancient Babylon. At the end of the harvest, the stalks of the last 
sheaves were plaited into straw fans or cages, in which the god could take 
refuge until the next season. 

These corn idols or 'dollies' have continued to be made wherever wheat 
is cultivated. In the Balkans a dolly known as the Montenegrin Fan is still 
fashioned in the shape of its predecessors on the Nile. In Germany and 
Scandinavia straw stars and straw angels are popular items of Christmas 
decoration. 

In England a vast repertoire of corn dollies was saved by rural 
conservationists when the art began to die out in the 1950s. Simple designs 
such as the Neck and the Horseshoe, the Knot and the Cat's Paw, the Bell 
and the Lantern, can be found in all the wheat-growing counties. Local 
specialities include the Shropshire Mare, the Derbyshire Crown, and the 
Cambridge Umbrella. The Kern Babby of Northumberland and the Ivy Girl 
of Kent are nothing other than modern versions of 'Mother Earth', distant 
daughters of Egyptian Ishtar, of Demeter of the Greeks, and of Roman 
Ceres. 1 

The world knows three major staple cereals: rice, maize, and wheat. Of the 
three, 'Europe chose wheat.' Wheat came to Europe from Mesopotamia, and 
wherever Europeans have settled in force, they have taken their wheat with 
them-first to the empty lands of the neolithic north-west, more recently to 
the virgin prairies of America, Australia, and southern Siberia. The process 




whereby 'the choice' was made involved an endless series of experiments 
over several millennia. Although the rival cereals of rye, barley, oats, 
buckwheat, and millet have continued to exist in Europe, the triumphal 
march of King Wheat is uncontestable. 2 

Wheat-the genus Triticum of the grain-bearing grass family-is known 
in more than 1,000 varieties. Its grain is extremely nutritious. It consists on 
average of 70 per cent carbohydrate, 12 per cent protein, 2 per cent fat, 1.8 
per cent minerals. The protein content is markedly higher than that of rice, 1 
lb yielding up to 1,500 calories. Wheat-based nutrition is one of the factors 
which has given most Europeans a clear advantage in bodily stature over 
most rice-eaters and corn-eaters. Wheat is a seasonal crop, which only 
requires intensive labour at the spring sowing and the autumn harvest. 
Unlike the rice-growers, who had to tend the paddy-fields in disciplined 
brigades throughout the year, the wheat farmer was granted time and 
freedom to branch out, to grow secondary crops, to reclaim land, to build, to 
fight, to politicize. This conjunction may well contain the preconditions for 
many features of Europe's social and political history, from feudalism and 
individualism to warmongering and imperialism. Wheat, however, quickly 
exhausts the soil. In ancient times, the land could only retain its fertility if 
the wheat fields were regularly left fallow and manured by domestic 
animals. From this there arose the traditional European pattern of mixed 
arable and livestock farming, and the varied diet of cereals, vegetables, and 
meat. 

In bread-making, wheat proteins have the unique property of forming 
gluten when mixed with water to form dough. In turn, the gluten retains 
carbon dioxide emitted from the fermentation of yeast. The net result is a 
wheaten loaf that is lighter, finer, and more digestible than any of its 
competitors. 3 'Give us this day our daily bread' is a sentiment which 
European civilization could share with some of its Middle Eastern 
neighbours, but not with Indians, Chinese, Aztecs, or Incas. 


The Chalcolithic Age is a term used by some prehistorians to describe the 
long transitional phase when Stone and Bronze overlapped. 

The Bronze Age was marked by the manufacture of a new alloy through the 
admixture of copper with tin. Its onset began in the Middle East c.3000 bc, in 




northern Europe perhaps a thousand years later. Especially in the Mediterranean, 
it saw the growth of urban culture: written records, specialized crafts, 
widespread trade. Its greatest achievements were found at Mycenae, unearthed 
by Heinrich Schliemann from 1876 and at Cnossos in Crete, excavated by Sir 
Arthur Evans in 1899-1930. These sites are roughly contemporary with the 
stone circles at Stonehenge, whose three phases of construction began c.2600 bc. 
Charcoal from the 'Aubrey Holes' of Phase I at Stonehenge has been carbon- 
dated to 1848 bc ± 275 years; an antler pick from a stone socket of Phase III to 
1710 bc ± 150 years. Hence, whilst advanced civilizations akin to those of the 
Middle East were developing in the Aegean, the peoples of the north-west were 
passing through the transition from Neolithic to Bronze, [samphire] 

However, talk of 'advanced' or 'backward' cultures might well be inhibited 
by the skills of the engineers of Stonehenge, who contrived to transport eighty 
blue-stones weighing over fifty tons apiece from the distant Presceliy Mountains 
of South Wales, and to erect them with such precision that awestruck observers 
have imagined them to be the working parts of a sun-computer.- Indeed, 
carvings at Stonehenge of axes and daggers resembling objects found in the 
shaft-graves at Mycenae gave rise once again to speculation about direct 
contacts with the Mediterranean. 

Interregional trade, especially in minerals, is one of the important features of 
Bronze Age Europe. The Peninsula's mineral resources were rich and varied, but 
their distribution was uneven; and a widespread network of trade-routes grew up 
in response to the imbalances. Salt had been sought from the earliest times, 
either by mining rock-salt or by evaporating brine from seaside salt-pans. Huge 
rock-salt mountains occur naturally in several locations, from Cardona in 
Catalonia to the Salzkammergut in Austria or Wieliczka in Poland. Primitive 
salt-pans or sali-nae were located all along the hot southern coast, from the 
Rhone to the Dnieper. Now, permanent 'salt roads' began to function. Best 
known among them was the ancient Via Salaria, which linked Rome with the 
salt-pans of the Adriatic coast. Amber, which can be found both on the western 
shore of Jutland and on the Baltic shore east of the Vistula, was greatly prized as 
jewellery. The ancient 'amber road' ran down the valley of the Oder, through the 
Moravian Gap to the Danube, and over the Brenner Pass to the Adriatic. 
Obsidian and lapis lazuli were also in great demand. Copper and tin were the 
staples. Copper came first from Cyprus- whence its name-later from the 
Dolomites, and above all from the Carpathians. Carpathian copper found its way 
northwards at an early date to Scandinavia, and was later sent south to the 


Aegean. Tin, which was not always distinguished by the ancients from lead, was 
brought from distant Cornwall. The search for copper and tin seems to have 
stimulated transcontinental contacts more effectively than the subsequent search 
for iron, which was found much more readily. 


VINO 

Wine is no ordinary beverage. It has always been associated with love and 
religion. Its name, like that of Venus, is derived from the Sanskrit vena, 
'beloved'. Coming from the Caucasus, it featured in both the daily diet and 
the religious ceremonies of the ancient world. First cultivated by Noah 
{Genesis ix. 20), it inspired not only pagan bacchanalia but also the 
communion cup of Christianity. 1 

Saint Martin of Tours, born at Sabaria (modern Szombathely) near the 
Danube, was the first patron saint of wine-drinkers. St Urban and St Vincent 
(whose name offers a play on 'reeking of wine'), became the principal 
patrons of wine-growers and vintners. 

Commercial wine-growing in medieval Europe was pioneered by the 
Benedictines at Chateau-Prieure in the Bordeaux region, and at locations 
such as the Clos Vougeot on the Cote de Beaune in Burgundy. The Cluniacs 
on the Cote d'Or near Macon, and the Cistercians at Nuits St Georges, 
extended the tradition. According to Froissart, England's possession of 
Bordeaux demanded a fleet of 300 vessels to carry the vintage home. 
Benedictine (1534) from the Abbey of Fecamp, and Chartreuse (1604) from 
the Charterhouse in Dauphine, pioneered the art of fortified wine. 

Europe's wine zone cuts the Peninsula in two. Its northern reaches pass 
along a line stretching from the Loire, through Champagne to the Mosel and 
the Rhineland, and thence eastwards to the slopes of the Danube, and on to 
Moldavia and Crimea. There are very few wine-growing districts which did 
not once belong to the Roman Empire. Balkan wines in Serbia, Romania, 
Bulgaria, and Greece, inhibited by the anti-alcoholic Ottomans, are every bit 
as ancient as those of Spain, Italy, or France. 

The consumption of wine has far-reaching social, psychological, and 




medical consequences. It has been invoked as a factor in religious and 
political groupings, such as the Protestant-Catholic divide in Germany, and 
even in the fate of battles. 'It was wine and beer that clashed at Waterloo. 
The red fury of wine repeatedly washed in vain against the immovable wall 
of the sons of beer... ' 2 

Nor has St Martin's homeland lost its viticultural excellence. The 
volcanic soil on the slopes above Tokay, the hot summer air of the 
Hungarian plain, the moisture of the Bodrog River, and the most nobly 
rotten of 'Aszu' grapes, form a unique combination. The pungent, velvety, 
peachlike essentia of golden Tokay is not to everyone's taste; and has rarely 
been well produced in recent decades. But it was once laid down for 200 
years in the most exclusive cellars of Poland, and kept for the death-bed of 
mon-archs. A bottle of 'Imperial Tokay' from the days of Francis-Joseph is 
still one of the connoisseur's most prized ambitions. 3 


GGANTIJA 

The islands of Malta present two historic puzzles-their language and their 
megaliths. The former is Semitic, of mediaeval Arab provenance. It is the 
only Semitic tongue to be written in the Latin script. (Romantic philologists 
once linked it with ancient Phoenician.) The megaliths are far older. The 
principal sites at the temple of Ggantija on Gozo Island, and at the unique 
subterranean hypogeum or 'collective burial chamber' at Hal Saflieni, dating 
from c.2400 bc. The earliest rock-cut monuments were constructed a 
millennium before. 1 

The procession of civilizations through Malta reads like a shorthand 
guide to European history. 2 After the neolithic cave-dwellers, who built the 
megaliths, and the Bronze Age Beaker Folk, came the Carthaginians (from 
the seventh century bc) and then the Romans (from 218 bc). Gozo is often 
identified as 'Calypso's Isle', where Odysseus was stranded. St Paul was 
shipwrecked in a bay named after him, north of Valletta, in ad 60. Allocated 
to the Eastern (Byzantine) Empire in 395, Malta was then ruled successively 




by Arabs (from 870), by Normans (from 1091), by the Knights Hospitallers 
(from 1530), by the French (from 1798), by the British (from 1802)-and 
from 1964, belatedly, by the Maltese themselves. 


Special prominence accrued to those districts where several of the desired 
commodities could be found in close proximity. One such district was the 
Salzkammergut (Noricum), where the salt mountains of Ischl and Hallstatt lay 
alongside the metal mines of Noriae. Another lay in the vicinity of Cracow, 
where silver, lead, iron, and salt could all be found within a stone's throw of the 
upper Vistula. Most productive of all, however, were the islands of the Aegean. 
Melos yielded obsidian; Paros yielded pure white marble; Kythnos yielded 
copper; Siphnos, and Laurion on the coast of Attica, yielded silver and lead. The 
wealth and power of Crete, and later of Mycenae, was clearly connected with the 
command of these Aegean resources and with their role as the termini of the 
transcontinental trade routes. They were the focus of what has been called the 
'international spirit' of the Bronze Age. 


DASA 

Apopular history of mathematics states that the advance of the Beaker 
Folk into neolithic Europe was accompanied by the spread both of the Indo- 
European languages and of the decimal system. The statement is supported 
by lists of number words from a selection of Indo-European languages 
which use the Base-10 or decimal method of numeration. The implication is 
that prehistoric Europe was familiar with Base-10 counting three millennia 
before its introduction in written form. 1 

It is intriguing, of course, to think that one might reconstruct modes of 
counting in a remote and illiterate society, for which no direct evidence is 
available. Yet there can be no certainty that numbers used today have 
remained constant since prehistoric times; and one must be careful to test the 
hypothesis against all the most relevant languages:

Sanskrit, meaning 'perfect speech', is the second oldest of the recorded 
Indo-European languages. It was the language of ancient India and, in Hindu 
tradition, of the Gods. It was employed c.1500 BC for the composition of 
Vedic literature. Its prime followed shortly after the fall of the Indus 
civilization, which invented the decimal system. 

Sanskrit's number words were definitely based on decimal counting. Its 
units 1-10 corresponded with those found in other Indo-European languages. 
Its teens were simple combinations of units with the word for ten, hence 
ekadasa (1 + 10 = 11) or navadasa (9 + 10 = 19). Its tens were combinations 
of units with the collective numeral for a 'decade', dasat(i), hence vimsati or 
dvimdesati (2 x 10 = 20) or trimsati (3x10 = 30). Its word for 1,000, 
dasasata, meaning 'ten hundreds', stood alongside sa-hasra, a variation used 
in the formation of still higher numbers. It had a single word, crore for '10 
million', and another, satam, to express 'percentage'. 2 Latin numbers, too, 
are essentially decimal. But their structure bears no relation to Roman 
numerals, which are based on conglomerates of units, fives, and tens. 

The Celtic languages, of which Welsh is the most active modern 
survivor, once stretched across much of Europe. They belong to the most 
ancient Indo-European forms in the West. Yet Celtic numerals have 
preserved elements of counting in Base-5, Base-10, and especially Base-20. 
Modern Welsh, like Sanskrit, uses decimal units for 1-10; but in the teens it 
uses numbers similar in structure to Roman numerals. Sixteen is un ar 
bymtheg or 'one over five and ten' (XVI); and nineteen is pedwar ar 
bymtheg or 'four over five and ten'. Above nineteen, Base-20 counting takes 
over. Ugain is the base, and deugain (40), trigain (60), and pedwar gain (80) 
are all multiples of twenty. Thirty, seventy, and ninety are expressed as 'ten 
over' a multiple of twenty. Fifty, banner cant, means 'half of a hundred'.

Base-20 counting, which started by using toes as well as fingers, is 
preserved in the English word 'score 5 , which derives from the mark cut into 
counting-sticks. It is also reflected in French quatre-vingt, meaning 'four 
times twenty', which is probably a relic of Celtic Gaul. 

In all probability, therefore, Europe's early peoples counted in twos, 
fives, tens, dozens, or scores as they thought fit. At some point they must 
also have encountered the Babylonian system of Base-60, which was 
adopted for counting minutes and seconds. There is little reason to assume 
that Indo-Europeans in general, or the Beaker Folk in particular, were 
decimalized from the start. 

In fact, Europe had to wait until the thirteenth century ad before Base-10 
numbers were widely introduced. The key step, the use of 0 for 'zero', had 
first been taken in India. From there, the decimal system found its way into 
the Muslim world, and through Arabic Spain into Christendom. For several 
centuries it operated alongside the much clumsier Roman numerals, which 
could not even be used for addition or multiplication. When it finally 
triumphed, many Europeans did not realize that their numbers were not 
European at all. 3 (See Appendix III, p. 1242.) 


Neither Crete nor Mycenae were known to the early classicists who first 
formed our view of the ancient world. But it is now generally accepted that 
Minoan culture on Crete, and Mycenean culture on mainland Greece, formed the 
twin peaks of 'Europe's first civilization'. From the day when Schliemann found 
a golden death-mask in one of the royal shaft-graves at Mycenae, and 
telegraphed the mistaken news: 'Today I have looked on the face of 
Agamemnon', it was clear that he was opening up something far more 




significant than just another rich prehistoric grave, [loot] Both the palace sites 
on Crete, at Cnossos, Phaestus, and Mallia, and the mainland sites at Mycenae, 
Tiryns, and Pylos have yielded abundant proof of art, religion, technology, and 
social organization of a far more sophisticated kind than anything known before. 
The golden age of Minoan life, in the so-called 'palatial period', began c.1900 
bc. That of the more warlike Mycenaeans, whose fortresses commanded the 
Plain of Argos and the Gulf of Corinth, began three or four centuries later. 
Together with the Trojans, who commanded the Dardanelles, the Minoans and 
the Mycenaeans brought European history out of the realm of faceless 
archaeology, [thronos] 

In the late Bronze Age of central Europe, a widespread group of 'Urnfield 
cultures' was characterized by cemeteries where the cremated remains of the 
dead were buried in urns together with elaborate grave goods. Important Bronze 
Age sites have been found at Terramare (Italy), El Argar (Spain), Leubingen, 
Buchau, Adlerberg (Germany), Unetice near Prague in Czechoslovakia, and at 
Otomani in Romania. 

In the last quarter of the second millennium, c.1200 bc, Bronze Age Europe 
suffered an unexplained breakdown from which it never recovered. 
Archaeologists write of a 'general systems collapse'. Trade was disrupted; cities 
were abandoned; political structures were destroyed. Waves of invaders 
descended on the remnants. Crete, having barely withstood a series of terrible 
natural catastrophes, had already fallen to the Mycenean Greeks, before 
Mycenae itself was destroyed. Within the space of a single century, many 
established centres passed into oblivion. The Aegean was overrun by tribes from 
the interior. The Hittite Empire in Asia Minor came to an end. Egypt itself was 
besieged by unidentified 'sea peoples'. The Urnfield People survived in Central 
Europe relapsing into a long passive era which ended with the appearance of the 
Celts. Greece was plunged into its archaic Dark Age which separated the 
legendary era of the Trojan Wars from the recorded history of the later city- 
states. 


SAMPHIRE 


Boiled Samphire.... Pick marsh samphire during July or August at low 




tide. It should be carefully washed soon after collection and is best eaten 
very fresh. Tie the washed samphire with its roots still intact in bundles, and 
boil in shallow unsalted water for 8-10 minutes. Cut the string, and serve 
with melted butter. Eat the samphire by picking each stem up by the root and 
biting lightly, pulling the fleshy part away from the woody core. 1 

Prehistoric food has long since perished, and cannot easily be studied. 
Modern attempts to reconstruct the menus and the gastronomic techniques of 
the neolithic period rely on six main sources of information. Prehistoric 
mbbish tips present the archaeologists with large collections of meatbones, 
eggshells, and shellfish remains. The kitchen areas of hut sites often reveal 
seeds and pollen grains which can be identified and analysed. Implements 
for fishing and hunting and utensils for preparing, cooking, and eating food 
have survived in large numbers. (Cauldrons for boiling were common; ovens 
for baking were not.) The total food resources of the past can be assessed by 
subtracting modern items-such as yeast, wine, or onions-from the vast 
repertoire of edible plants and fauna living in the wild. All sorts of delicacies 
no longer in the cookbooks are known to have been eaten: guillemots, 
seakale, hedgehogs, beechmast, sloes. Much may also be learned by analogy 
with the food technology of primitive or pre-industrial societies, whose skills 
in everything from wild herbs to wind-drying, salting, and preserving are by 
necessity very considerable. Finally, modern techniques have permitted the 
analysis of the stomach contents of prehistoric corpses. The Tollund Man, 
for example, had eaten linseed, barley, and wild plants, [tollund] [vino] 

Whether, in the end, one can ever recreate an authentic neolithic meal is 
a matter for debate, preferably pursued whilst chasing the samphire with 
marrow-bones served with virpa: 

Marrow-Bones. (8 oz/225 g. marrow-bones, flour, salt, dry toast) Scrape 
and wash the bones, and saw in half across the shaft... Make a stiff paste of 
flour and water, and roll it out. Cover the ends of the bones with the paste to 
seal in the marrow, and tie the bones in a floured cloth. Stand upright in a 
pan of boiling salted water and simmer slowly for about 2 hours ... Untie the 
cloth, and remove the paste from each bone. Fasten a paper napkin round 
each one and serve with dry toast. 2 

Sowans or Virpa. (1 lb/450 g. fine oatmeal, 3 lb. wheatmeal, 16 pt./ 91, 



water) Put both meals into a stone crock. Stir in 14 pints or 8 litres of 
lukewarm water, and let it stand for 5-8 days until sour. Pour off the clear 
liquid ... This is the swats, which makes a refreshing drink. The remainder 
in the crock will resemble thick starch. Add about 2 pints or 1 litre water to 
give the consistency of cream. Strain through a cheesecloth over a colander. 
The liquid ... will contain all the nutritious properties of oatmeal... Gentle 
mbbing with a wooden spoon, and a final squeezing of the cloth ... will 
hasten the process. 3 

Reconstructing the past is rather like translating poetry. It can be done, but 
never exactly. Whether one deals in prehistoric recipes, colonial settlements, 
or medieval music, it needs great imagination and restraint if the twin perils 
of artless authenticity and clueless empathy are to be avoided. Did neolithic 
cooks really serve marrow-bones in a paper napkin, or strain their virpa 
through a cheesecloth? And were there prehistoric Augusts, when samphire 
could be picked? 


THRONOS 

The throne in the Palace of Knossos in Crete has been described as 
'Europe's oldest chair'. The claim is unlikely to be correct. What is certain is 
that high-backed chairs with arm-rests were reserved in ancient times for 
ceremonial purposes. They enabled rulers and high priests to assume a 
relaxed, dignified, and elevated position, whilst everyone else stood at their 
feet. From the royal throne, the concept of the chair as a symbol of authority 
has passed to the cathedra or See of bishops and to the Chairs of professors. 

Furniture for everyday sitting is a relatively modern, European invention. 
When not standing, primitive peoples sat, squatted, or lay on the floor. Many 
Asian nations, including the Japanese, still prefer to do so. Ancient Greeks 
and Romans reclined on couches. The medievals used rough-hewn benches. 
Individual chairs were first introduced into monastic cells, perhaps to 
facilitate reading. They did not join the standard household inventory until 
the sixteenth century, nor the repertoire of fine design until the eighteenth. 




They were not widely used in schools, offices and workplaces until the end 
of the nineteenth. 

Unfortunately, flat-bottomed chairs do not match the requirements of the 
human anatomy. Unlike the horse-saddle, which transfers much of the rider's 
body-weight onto the stirrup, leaving the natural curvature of the spine 
intact, chairs lift the thighs at right-angles to the trunk and disrupt the 
equilibrium of the skeleton. In so doing, they put abnormal stress on the 
immobilized pelvis, hip-joints, and lumbar regions. Chronic backache is one 
of the many self-inflicted scars of modern progress. 1 


The Iron Age brings prehistory within range of regular historical sources. 
Iron-working is usually thought to have been initiated by the Hittites of Asia 
Minor. A gold-hilted dagger with an iron blade, unearthed from the royal tombs 
at Alaca Huyiik, may originate from the end of the third millennium bc. From 
there, the use of iron spread first to Egypt c.1200 bc, to the Aegean c.1000 bc, 
and to the Danube Basin c.750 bc. [tollund] 

On the mainland of the Peninsula, the prehistoric Iron Age is customarily 
divided into two successive periods-that of Hallstatt (c.750-400 bc) and of La 
Tene (c.400-50). Hallstatt, a site in the Saltzkammergut first explored in 1846, 
gave its name to a period and culture which blended the traditions of the former 
Urnfield people with fresh influences coming from the East. La Tene, a site on 
Lake Neuchatel in Switzerland discovered in 1858, gave its name to the second 
period, where iron-working reached a very high level of competence. 
Longswords, beautifully wrought from a hard iron core and a soft iron cutting 
edge which could be fearfully sharpened, were the hallmark of a warrior society, 
living in great hill forts. These people were familiar with the potter's wheel, with 
horse-drawn chariots, with the minting of coins, and with highly stylistical art 
forms that combine native, Mediterranean, and even nomadic elements. At 
Rudki in the Holy Cross Mountains near Cracow in southern Poland, they left 
traces of the most extensive iron-workings in prehistoric Europe. They were 
active traders, and the tombs of their princes have yielded up Celtic jewellery, 
Etruscan vases, Greek amphorae, Roman artefacts. Not without dissenting 
voices, they have been widely identified with the Celts, The first great nation 
north of the Alps whose name we know'. Apart from La Tene itself, important 
sites are located at Entremont in Provence, at Alesia in Burgundy, and at 




Villanova in Emilia. 


With the appearance of Celts, European prehistory reaches the knottiest of all 
problems-the matching of the material cultures defined by archaeologists with 
the ethnic and linguistic groupings known from other sources. Most prehistori¬ 
ans do indeed accept that those iron-workers of the La Tene period were Celts, 
that they derived from the formation or influx of Celtic tribes in the first 
millennium bc, and that they were one and the same group whom Greek and 
Roman literary records refer to as Keltoi or Celtae. But the most recent survey of 
the matter maintains that the origin of the Celtic languages may lie much further 
back, in the neolithic era.- One thing is certain: modern linguistic research has 
proved beyond doubt that the languages of the Celts are cognate both to Latin 
and to Greek, and to most of the languages of modern Europe. The Celts were 
the vanguard of a linguistic community that can be more clearly defined than the 
archaeological communities of prehistory. The Celts stand at the centre of the 
Indo-European phenomenon. 

As long ago as 1786 Sir William Jones, a British judge serving in Calcutta, 
made the epoch-making discovery that the main languages of Europe are closely 
related to the principal languages of India. Jones saw the link between classical 
Latin and Greek and ancient Sanskrit. It subsequently turned out that many 
modern Indian languages formed part of the same family as their counterparts in 
Europe, namely the Romance, Celtic, Germanic, Baltic, and Slavonic groups 
(see Appendix III, p. 1232). 

At the time, no one had any idea how this family of'Indo-European' 
languages could have found its way across Eurasia, though it came to be 
assumed that they must have been carried to the West by migrating peoples. In 
1902, however, a German archaeologist. Gustav Kossinna. linked the Indn- 
F.urnneam with a specific type of corded ware pottery, that was widely 
distributed in sites throughout northern Germany. Kossinna's conclusions 
indicated that an 'Indo-European homeland' could have existed in the north 
European Iron Age. The idea was developed by the prominent Australian 
archaeologist Vere Gordon Childe (1892-1957), whose synthesis, The Dawn of 
European Civilisation (1925), was one of the most influential books of its day. 
Most recently the Lithuanian-American archaeologist Marija Gimbutas has 
confirmed his placement of the Indo-European homeland on the steppelands of 
Ukraine by identifying it with the widespread Kurgan culture of barrow-burials 


in that area: 


TOLLUND 

Tollund is the name of a marsh near Aarhus in Denmark, where in 1950 
the whole body of a prehistoric man was-discovered in a state of remarkable 
preservation. It is displayed in the Silkeborg Museum. The tan-nic acid of 
the peat had mummified him so perfectly that the delicate facial features 
were quite intact, as were the contents of his stomach. Except for a pointed 
leather cap and waistband, he was naked, and had been strangled with a 
braided leather rope, apparently the victim of ritual murder some two 
thousand years ago. His strange fate can evoke a haunting sense of 
compassion, even today: 

Something of his sad freedom 
As he rode the tumbril 
Should come to me, driving, 

Saying the names 

Tollund, Grauballe, Nebelgard, 

Watching the pointing hands 
Of country people, 

Not knowing their tongue. 

Out there in Jutland 

In the old, man-killing parishes 

I will feel lost, 

Unhappy, and home. 1 

Yet Tollund Man is not alone. Similar discoveries were made thirty years 
later at Lindow Moss in Cheshire (England); and a particularly interesting 
corpse came to light in September 1991 in a glacial pocket near the Similaun 
Ridge of the Otztaler Alps in South Tirol. The body appeared to be that of a 
pre-Bronze Age hunter, fully dressed and equipped. He was 5 feet (152 cm) 
in height, 120 lb (54.4 kg), perhaps twenty years old, with blue eyes, a 
shaven face, and even a complete brain. He was very thoroughly clad in 
tanned leather tunic and leggings, a cap of chamois fur, birchbark gloves, 
and hay-lined, thick-soled boots. His skin was tattooed with blue tribal 




markings in four places, and he was wearing a necklace made from 20 
sunray thongs and one stone bead. He was carrying an empty wooden¬ 
framed rucksack, a broken 32-inch (975 cm) bow, a quiver of 14 bone-tipped 
arrows, a stone-bladed axe tipped with pure copper, a short flint knife, and a 
body belt containing flints and tinder. He apparently froze to death whilst 
crossing the pass in a blizzard. Rigor mortis fixed his outstretched arm, still 
trying to shield his eyes. Dated to 2731 BC ± 125, he finally reached an 
unintended destination in the deep-freeze at Innsbruck University with some 
5,000 years' delay. 2 

Prehistoric bodies are clearly a valuable source of scientific information. 
Recent advances in 'prehistoric pathology' have facilitated detailed analysis 
of the bodies' tissues, diseases, bacteria, and diet. But no one can entirely 
forget the case of Piltdown Man, whose bones were unearthed at a quarry in 
Sussex in 1908. In the same year that Tollund Man was discovered, Piltdown 
Man was shown to be one of the great master forgeries. 


Constantly accumulating archaeological discoveries have effectively eliminated 
the earlier theories of Indo-European homelands.... The Kurgan culture seems 
the only remaining candidate for being Proto-Indo-European. There was no other 
culture in the neolithic and chalcolithic periods which would correspond with the 
hypothetical mother culture of the Indo-Europeans as reconstructed with the help 
of common words; and there were no other great expansions and conquests 
affecting whole territories where the earliest historic sources and a cultural 
continuum prove the existence of Indo-European speakers.- 

The essential point here is that Gordon Childe and his successors were using the 
term 'culture' in relation to human groups defined both by material and by 
linguistic criteria. Yet on reflection there seems no good reason why 
archaeological cultures should necessarily be correlated with linguistic groups in 
this way. The Indo-European enigma is not really solved. It is particularly 
exciting to realize that languages evolve by ceaseless mutation just as living 
organisms do. In this case, it may become possible to correlate the chronology of 
language change in Europe with that of genetic change. By comparing the time- 
trace of 'linguistic clocks' with that of our 'molecular clocks', the story of the 





origins of the European peoples and their languages may one day be 
unravelled.- 

Europe's place-names are the product of thousands of years. They form a deep 
resource for understanding its past. The names of rivers, hills, towns, provinces, 
and countries are often the relics of bygone ages. The science of onomastics can 
delve beneath the crust of historical records.- By common consent the names of 
rivers are among the most ancient and persistent. They are frequently the only 
surviving links with the peoples who preceded the present population. By a 
process of accretion, they can sometimes preserve a record of the successive 
waves of settlement on their banks. The 'River Avon', for example, combines 
two synonyms, one English, the other the older Welsh. Five Celtic root words 
connected with water- afon, dwr, uisge, rhe, and possibly don -supply the 
commonest elements in river-names right across Europe. Scholars endlessly 
disagree, of course. But among the best-known candidates would be the Inn and 
the Yonne, Avignon on the Rhodanus ('Watertown' on the 'Swift River'), the 
Esk, the Etsch (or Adige), the Usk, and the Danube. 

Celtic names abound from Portugal to Poland. The modern Welsh dwr, 
'water', for example, has its cognates in Dee, Douro, Dordogne, Derwent (Clear 
Water), Durance, and Oder/Odra. Pen, meaning 'head' and hence 'mountain', 
appears in Pennine, Apennine, Pieniny, and Pindus; ard, 'high', in Arden, 
Ardennes, Lizard (High Cape), and Auvergne (Ar Fearanriy 'High Country'); 
dun, 'fort', in Dunkeld (Fort of the Celts), Dungannon, London, Verdun, 
Augustodunum (Fort Augustus, Autun), Lugdunum (Lyons), Lugodinum 
(Leyden), Thun in Switzerland, and Tyniec near Cracow. All attest to the far- 
flung presence of the Celts, [llanfair] [lugdunum] 

Similar exercises can be undertaken with Norse roots, Germanic roots, 
Slavonic roots, even Phoenician and Arabic roots. Etna is a very suitable 
Phoenician name meaning 'the furnace'. Elsewhere in Sicily, Marsala has a 
simple Arabic name meaning 'Port of God'. Trajan's bridge across the upper 
Tagus in Spain is now known as La puente de Alcantara-al cantara being the 
exact Arabic equivalent of the Latin pons. 

Slavonic place-names spread much further west than the present-day 
Slavonic population. In northern Germany, for example, they are common in the 
region of Hanover. In Austria, names such as Zwettl (Svetly, 'Bright Spot'), 
Doebling (Dub, 'Little Oak'), or Feistritz (Bystrice, 'Swift Stream') can be 


encountered from the environs of Vienna to Tyrol. In Italy, they overlap with 
Italian in the province of Friuli. 

The names of towns and villages frequently incorporate a record of their 
origins. Edinburgh was once 'Edwin's fort'; Paris, the city of the Parish' tribe; 
Turin (Torino), the city of the Taurini; Gottingen, the 'family home of the 
Godings'; Krakow (Cracow), the seat of good King Krak. Elsewhere, they 
record the attributes or function of the place. Lisboa/Lisbon means 'Good Spot'; 
Trondheim means 'Home of the Throne'; Munich/Mtinchen, 'Place of the 
Monks'; Redruth 'Place of the Druids'; Novgorod, 'New City'. Sometimes they 
recall distant disasters. Ossaia in Tuscany, meaning 'Place of Bones', lies on the 
site of Hannibal's victory at Trasimeno in 217 bc. Pourrieres in Provence, 
originally 'Campi Putridi' (Putrid Fields), marks the slaughter of the Teutons by 
Marius in 102 BC; Lechfeld in Bavaria, the 'Field of Corpses', the scene of the 
Magyars' defeat in ad 955. 

The names of nations frequently reflect the way they saw themselves or were 
seen by others. The west Celtic neighbours of the Anglo-Saxons call themselves 
Cymry or 'Compatriots', but were dubbed Welsh or 'Foreigners' by the Germanic 
intruders. Similarly, French-speaking Walloons are known to the Flemings as 
Waalsch. The Germanic peoples often call themselves Deutsch or Dutch 
(meaning 'germane' or 'alike'), but are called Niemtsy, 'the Dumb', by their 
Slavonic neighbours. The Slavs think of each other as the people of the Slovo or 
'common word', or as Serb (kinsman). They often call the Latins Vlachy, 
Wallachs, or Wiochy - which is another variation on the 'Welsh' theme. The 
assorted Vlachs and Wallachians of the Balkans tend to call themselves Romani, 
Rumeni, or Aromani (Romans). 

The names of countries and provinces frequently record the people who once 
ruled them. The Celtic root of Gal-, indicating 'Land of the Gaels or Gauls', 
occurs in Portugal, Galicia in Spain, Gallia (Gaul), Pays des Galles (Wales), 
Cornwall, Donegal, Caledonia (later Scotland), Galloway, Calais, Galicia in 
southern Poland, even in distant Galatia in Asia Minor. 

Place-names, however, are infinitely mobile. They change over time; and 
they vary according to the language and the perspective of the people who use 
them. They are the intellectual property of their users, and as such have caused 
endless conflicts. They can be the object of propaganda, of tendentious 
wrangling, of rigid censorship, even of wars. In reality, where several variants 
exist, one cannot speak of correct or incorrect forms. One can only indicate the 



variant which is appropriate to a particular time, place, or usage. Equally, when 
referring to events over large areas of time and space, the historian is often 
forced to make a choice between equally inappropriate alternatives. 

Yet historians must always be sensitive to the implications. One easily 
forgets that 'Spain', 'France', 'England', 'Germany', 'Poland', or 'Russia' are 
relatively recent labels which can easily be used anachronistically. It is clearly 
wrong to talk of 'France' instead of 'Gaul' in the Roman period, as it is dubious 
to speak of 'Russia' prior to the state in Muscovy. Writing in English, one 
automatically writes of the 'English Channel', ignoring that 'La Manche' is at 
least half French. Writing in Polish, one automatically writes 'Lipsk' for Leipzig, 
without laying claim to the Polishness of Saxony, just as in German one says 
'Danzig' for Gdansk, or 'Breslau' for Wroclaw, without necessarily implying the 
exclusive Germanity of Pomerania or Silesia. One forgets that official language, 
which presents place-names in forms preferred by the bureaucracy of the ruling 
state, does not always concur with the practice of the inhabitants. Above all, one 
forgets that different people have every reason to think of place-names in 
different ways, and that no one has the right to dictate exclusive forms. One 
man's Deny is another man's Londonderry. This person's Antwerpen is the other 
person's Anvers. For them, it was East Galicia or Eastern Little Poland; for 
others, it is 'Western Ukraine'. For the ancients, it was the Borysthenes: for the 
moderns, it is the Dnipr, the Dnepr, or the Dnieper. For them, it is Oxford, or 
even Niu-Jin: for us, forever Rhydychen. 

'European History' has always been an ambiguous concept. Indeed, both 
'Europe' and 'History' are ambiguous. Europe may just refer to that Peninsula 
whose landward boundary for long stayed undefined-in which case historians 
must decide for themselves where the arbitrary bounds of their studies will lie. 
But 'European' can equally apply to the peoples and cultures which originated 
on the Peninsula-in which case the historian will be struggling with the world¬ 
wide problems of 'European Civilization'. History may refer to the past in 
general; or else, in distinction to prehistory, it may be confined to that part of the 
past for which a full range of sources are extant. With prehistory, one is dealing 
with the evidence of myth, of language, and above all of archaeology. With 
history in the narrower sense, one is also dealing with literary records, with 
documents, and above all with the work of earlier historians. In either case, 
whether one is beckoned by the ends of prehistory or the beginning of history 
proper, one is brought to the terminus of Europa's ride, to the island of Crete. 



1628 bc, Cnossos, Crete. Standing on the high northern terrace of the palace, 
the courtiers of Minos looked out to the distant sea over the shimmering groves 
of olive and cypress. They were the servants of the great Priest-King, masters of 
the Cretan thalassokratia the world's first 'seaborne empire'. Supported by the 
trade of their far-ranging ships, they lived a life of comfort, of ritual, and of 
administrative order. Their quarters were supplied with running water, with 
drainage, and with flushed sewers. Their walls were covered with frescos- 
griffins, dolphins, and flowers, painted onto luminous settings of deep blue and 
gold. Their spacious courtyards were regularly turned into arenas for the 
ceremonial sport of bull-leaping. Their underground storehouses were packed 
with huge stone vats filled with corn, wine, and oil for 4,000 people. Their 
domestic accounts were immaculately kept on soft clay tablets, using a method 
of writing which progressed over the centuries through hieroglyphic, cursive, 
and linear forms. Their craftsmen were skilled in jewellery, metalwork, 
ceramics, faience. They were so confident of their power and prosperity that 
none of their palaces was fortified (see Appendix III, p. 1217). 

Religion played a vital role in the life of the Minoans. The central object of 
their worship was probably the great Earth Goddess, later known as Rhea, 
mother of Zeus. She was revealed in many forms and aspects, and was attended 
by a host of lesser deities. Her sanctuaries were placed on mountain-tops, in 
caves, or in the temple-chambers of the palaces. Surviving sealstones portray 
naked women embracing the sacred boulders in ecstasy. Sacrifices were 
surrounded by the Cult of the Bull, by orgies, and by a mass of ritual 
paraphernalia such as altar tables, votive containers, blood-buckets, and wasp- 
waisted statuettes of fertility goddesses. The ubiquitous symbols of bulls' horns 
and of the labrys or double-headed axe were carried on high poles in procession. 
In times of danger or disaster, the sacrifice of animals was supplemented by the 
sacrifice of human children, even by cannibalistic feasts. (After all, Rhea's 
husband, Cronus, was remembered as a devourer of children, and but for a 
timely ruse would have eaten the infant Zeus.) Minoan ritual, therefore, was 
intense. But it was an important ingredient in the social cement which held a 
peaceable society together for centuries. Some observers have remarked on the 
absence of modern masculinity in representation of Minoan males. - These 
remarks necessarily prompt questions about the island's role in the transition 




from 'primitive matriarchy', and the onset of 'patriarchal warfare'. (See Plates 3, 

4.) 

Minoan civilization flourished on Crete for the best part of a thousand years. 
According to Sir Arthur Evans, the excavator of Cnossos, it passed through nine 
distinct phases, each identified with a particular ceramic style, from Early 
Minoan I to Late Minoan HI. The zenith was reached somewhere in the middle 
of Minoan II, in the second quarter of the second millennium bc. By that time, 
unbeknown to the courtiers on the terrace, the first of the 'great catastrophes' 
was upon them. 



The ethnic identity of the Minoans is the subject of considerable controversy. 
The old assumption that they were Hellenes is no longer widely accepted. The 
Linear A script, which might unlock the language of the earlier periods, has not 
been deciphered; whilst Linear B, which was definitively identified as Greek in 
1952, clearly belongs only to the final phase. Arthur Evans was convinced not 
only of a strong Egyptian influence on Crete but also of the possibility of 



Egyptian colonization. 'It may well be asked whether, in the times... that marked 
the triumph of the dynastic element in the Nile Valley, some part of the older 
population ... may not have made an actual settlement on the soil of Crete.'- 
However, in the course of the second millennium Crete seems to have been 
invaded by several waves of migrants. It can reasonably be supposed that the 
hellenization of the island began with one of the later waves some time after the 
'great catastrophes'. 

Another possibility is that the Minoans of the middle period were Hittites 
from Asia Minor. The Hittites were Indo-Europeans, and spoke a language 
called Kanesian. Their great confederation was centred on what is now Hattusas 
in Anatolia, and mounted a major challenge both to Mesopotamia and to Egypt. 
In the fourteenth century bc their greatest ruler, Suppiluliumash or 
Shubbiluliuma (c. 1380-1347 bc), extended his sway as far as Jerusalem. In 1269 
bc they entered a treaty of alliance with Egypt. (The bilingual text of the tablet 
recording this event, the oldest diplomatic document in existence, is now 
displayed in the foyer of the United Nations Building in New York.) In 1256 bc 
the Hittite King Khattushilish III travelled to Egypt to attend the wedding of his 
daughter with the Pharaoh Rameses II. So, if Hittite influence had been spread 
so widely over the Middle East, there is every likelihood that it could also have 
been projected from the mainland to Crete. More specifically, the discovery of a 
bull cult at the Hittite centre of (]atal Huyuk in Anatolia suggests a connection of 
much greater intimacy. But nothing is certain. 

According to later Greek legend, Crete was the birthplace both of Zeus and 
of the dreaded Minotaur. Zeus, after abducting Europa, had simply brought her 
to his island home. A cave on Mount Ida is still shown to tourists as the site of 
his birth. The Minotaur, on the other hand, was the product of a stranger passion. 
Pasiphae, the queen of Minos, was said to have taken a liking to a sacrificial bull 
presented by the sea-god, Poseidon, and, with the assistance of Daedalus, the 
architect of Cnossos, had succeeded in having intercourse with it. For this 
purpose, Daedalus devised a hollow wooden cow, within which the intrepid 
queen had presumably struck a suitable pose. The resultant offspring was the 
monstrous Minotaur-half-man, half-beast, Vmfamia di Creti. Whereupon 
Daedalus was ordered to devise a labyrinth in which to keep it. 

At that point, the plot thickened with the arrival of Theseus, hero of Athens. 
Theseus' obsession with killing the Minotaur may well be explained by the fact 
that he was the child of yet another mother who had dallied with a bull. At all 


events, having joined the annual transport of seven boys and seven maidens 
which Athens paid to Crete as tribute, he managed to reach Cnossos; and, 
mastering the labyrinth by means of a ball of thread provided by Ariadne, 
Pasiphae's daughter, he slew the Minotaur and escaped. He then fled with 
Ariadne to Naxos, where he deserted her. By another lamentable lapse, on 
approaching Athens he forgot to give the agreed signal of success, which was to 
change the colour of his sail from black to white. His despairing father, Aegeus, 
threw himself into the sea, which was henceforth named after him. These stories 
clearly date from an era when Crete was the great power, and the Greek 
communities of the mainland were dependent tributaries. 

Daedalus is also credited by legend with mankind's maiden flight. Barred by 
Minos from leaving Crete, he fashioned two pairs of wings from wax and 
feathers and, in the company of his son Icarus, soared from the slopes of Mount 
Ida. Icams flew too close to the sun, and plunged to his death. But Daedalus flew 
on to complete his escape to the mainland. 'Minos may own everything,' wrote 
Ovid, 'but not the air' (Omnia possideat, non possidet aera Minos). 

Mount Ida stands 8,000 ft (2,434 m) above the sea, and one can well imagine 
how the thermal currents would have carried those human birds to a height 
where the whole of Aegean civilization was laid out like a map beneath them. 
Crete itself, a rocky strip some 130 miles in length, faced south to the shore of 
Africa and north across the Aegean. Its dominion stretched to Sicily in the west 
and to Cyprus in the east. To the north-west lay the Peloponnese, dominated by 
the city of Mycenae with its royal 'beehive' tombs, and its Lion Gate. To the 
north-east, in the angle of Asia Minor, stood the ancient city of Troy. In the 
centre lay the scattered islands of the Cydades, Crete's first colonies. Nearest of 
all, set like a jet-black diamond in the deep blue sea, beautiful and ominous, rose 
the perfect cone of the island of Thera. 

It is doubtful that the Minoans knew much about the lands and peoples 
beyond the range of their ships. They knew North Africa, of course, especially 
Egypt, with which they traded: Cretan envoys are depicted on the temple walls at 
Thebes. Cnossos at the height of its magnificence in Late Minoan II coincided 
with the close of the 18th Dynasty of Aminhotep III, and hence with the 
accession of Tutankhamun. The Minoans knew the cities of the Levant-Sidon, 
Tyre, and Jericho-which were already ancient, and through them the countries 
of the Near East. In the seventeenth century bc the Hebrews were still kept 
captive in Egypt. The Aryans had recently migrated from Persia to India. The 



Babylonians ruled over the Land of the Two Rivers, united by Hammurabi the 
Lawgiver. Hammurabi's Code, based on the principle of 'an eye for an eye, a. 
tooth for a tooth', was the civilizational high point of the age. The Assyrians had 
recently become the vassals of Babylon. The Hittites, having formed the 
strongest state in western Asia, were starting to press into Palestine. (See 
Appendix III, p. 1216.) 

The Minoans may well have had dealings with the pre-Latin peoples of Italy. 
There was no obstacle to their ships cruising into the western Mediterranean. 
They could also have met the Bell-Beaker People and the Megalith-Builders of 
Malta and southern Spain, and have sailed into the Black Sea, where they could 
have encountered the Tripolye People. The latter could have acted as middlemen 
on the last, southern leg of the trade routes which led from the dominant Unetice 
and Tumulus peoples of the interior. The prime commodity was copper, its main 
source the mines of the Dolomites and the Carpathians. 

Beyond that, the veil of the Minoans' direct knowledge would have been 
firmly drawn. Whilst they basked in the Bronze Age, the northern lands lingered 
in the later stages of the neolithic. The westward march of the Indo-Europeans 
had undoubtedly begun. It is sometimes associated with the advent of a male- 
dominated warrior culture, which subdued both its peaceable predecessors and 
its own women. The advance guard of the Celts was already on station in central 
Europe. The Germanic, Baltic, and Slavonic tribes rested somewhere in the rear. 
The first northern trappers and merchants from beyond the 'frontier' may well 
have reached the Aegean. Both amber and jade had found their way to Crete. 

The eruption of Thera (Santorini) was one of the greatest events of European 
prehistory. In one crack of doom, like that at Krakatoa in modern times, 30 cubic 
kilometres of rock, fire, and sulphuric acid were blown twenty miles into the 
stratosphere. At a distance of only one hundred miles, the watchers at Cnossos 
could not have failed to see the plume and the flashes, and then the pillar of fiery 
ash. With nine minutes' delay they would have heard the boom, the rumbles, and 
the thuds. They would have seen the sea recede as it rushed to fill the gash in the 
seabed, only to recover with the dispatch of a mighty tidal wave that swamped 
the Cretan shore under a hundred feet of brine. 

High above Cnossos, on the northern slopes of Mount Juktas, the priests of 
the mountain shrine busied themselves with the human sacrifice which the 
disaster demanded. On this occasion, the everyday offerings of fruit, seeds, or 



wine, or even the slaughter of a prime bull, would not suffice. In the dark central 
chamber of the temple, one man prepared a blood-bucket adorned with the figure 
of a bull in white relief. At the inner end of the western chamber, a young 
woman lay face down, legs apart. On a low table, a young man lay with his feet 
bound-on his chest a bronze-bladed knife engraved with a boar's head. Beside 
him stood a powerful man of status, who wore a precious iron ring and an agate 
sealstone engraved with the figure of a god punting a boat. But the earthquake 
triggered by the eruption of Thera struck first. The temple roof collapsed. The 
sacrifice was never completed. The bodies of the participants remained where 
they lay, to be discovered three and a half millennia later.- 

The dating of Thera's eruption has largely been achieved by 
dendrochronology. In 1628 bc the rings of trees as far apart as the bristle-cone 
pines of California and the bog oaks of Ireland entered a period of stunted 
growth. Temperatures evidently plummeted throughout the northern hemisphere, 
probably in response to the Veil effect' of high-floating volcanic dust. 
Confirmation of a world-wide disaster in the period 1645 bc, ± 20 years, comes 
from sulphuric acid deposits in the relevant ice-layers in Greenland. Recent 
carbon-dating at Thera itself also suggests an eruption date at least a century 
earlier than the original estimate of 1500 bc. Scientific doubts remain, of course; 
but 1628 bc is clearly 'the best working hypothesis'.- 

The palace at Cnossos escaped the later fate of Pompeii and Herculaneum. A 
westerly wind happened to be blowing on the day of the eruption, and the 
heaviest deposits of ash fell on the coast of Asia Minor. Even so, Cnossos was 
rocked by the quake that felled walls and pillars; and one has to assume that 
damage to the vital Minoan navy was extensive, if not total. In the space of a few 
hours the cone of Thera was reduced to a smouldering ring of black basalt cliffs 
round an eerie, sulphurous lagoon. Like the stump of rock in the centre of that 
lagoon, Crete must have been left marooned at the centre of a blasted empire. 

Archaeological layering on eastern Crete shows that a clear interval of time 
separated the Thera eruption from a subsequent, and still unexplained, disaster 
which left the palace of Cnossos in ruins, with the clay tablets baked so hard by 
fire that they can still be read today. Thera did not destroy Cnossos, as was once 
proposed. But it certainly delivered the first of the blows which spelled the end 
of Minoan civilization. Material destruction and population loss must have been 
enormous, the disruption of trade crippling. A weakened Crete was left open to 
the mercy of Dorian warriors, and in due course was thoroughly hellenized. 


The violent end of Europe's first civilization inevitably prompts thoughts about 
the rise and fall of civilizations in general. One wonders whether the Minoan 
survivors would have blamed their misfortunes on their own shortcomings. One 
wonders whether the Catastrophe Theory that applies to various branches of the 
physical sciences can equally be applied to the long-term patterns of human 
affairs. One wonders whether the mathematical Theory of Chaos can somehow 
explain why long, tranquil periods of growth and development can be suddenly 
interrupted by intervals of confusion and disorder. Is it conceivable that the 
eruption of Thera was provoked by the fluttering wings of some prehistoric 
butterfly? 

Archaeologists and prehistorians think in large spans of time. For them, the 
prehistoric, Bronze Age civilization which came to an end with Cnossos and 
Mycenae was but the first of three great cycles of European history. The second 
cycle coincided with the classical world of Greece and Rome. The third cycle, 
which began with the 'systems collapse' at the end of the Roman Empire, 
coincides with the rise of modern Europe. It is still with us. 

Almost 3,500 years have passed since the destruction of Cnossos. In that 
time the face of Europe has been transformed many times over. Just as Greece 
succeeded to the glory that was Crete, so Rome was built on Greek foundations, 
and 'Europe' on the relics of Rome. Vigorous youth, confident maturity, and 
impotent age all seem to be encoded into the history of political and cultural 
communities as they are in the lives of individuals. Europe has no shortage of 
successors to the fate of Crete-of states and nations that once were strong and 
now are weak. Europe itself, which once was strong, is now weaker. The nuclear 
explosion at Chernobyl in April 1986 alerted people to the possibility of a 
continental disaster of Theran proportions; whilst in 1989 the explosive 
liberation of the nations of Eastern Europe inspired hopes of greater peace and 
unity. The watchers of late European III worry whether their fate will be one of 
terminal decline, of invasion by some new barbarians, or perhaps of catastrophic 
destruction. Or perhaps they will live to see the last golden summer of Late 
European IV. 



II 


HELLAS 

Ancient Greece 


There is a quality of excellence about Ancient Greece that brooks few 
comparisons. In the same way that the quality of Greek light enables painters to 
see form and colour with exceptional precision and intensity, so the conditions 
for human development in Greece seem to have favoured both the external 
environment and the inner life of mankind. Indeed, high-intensity sunlight may 
well have been one of the many ingredients which produced such spectacular 
results-in which case Homer, Plato, and Archimedes may be seen as the 
product of native genius plus photochemistry. 

Certainly, in trying to explain the Greek phenomenon, one would have to 
weigh a very particular combination of factors. One factor would have to be that 
sun-drenched but seasonal climate which provided optimal encouragement for a 
vigorous outdoor life. A second factor would be the Aegean, whose islands and 
straits provided an ideal nursery in the skills of seafaring, commerce, and 
colonization. A third factor would be the proximity of older, established 
civilizations whose achievements were waiting to be imported and developed. 
There were other parts of the world, such as present-day California or southern 
Australia, which possessed the same favourable climate. There were other 
enclosed seas, such as the Baltic or the Great Lakes of North America, which 
were suited to primitive navigation. There were numerous regions adjacent to the 
great River Valley civilizations that were perfectly habitable. But nowhere-with 






the possible exception of the Sea of Japan-did all three factors coincide as they 
did in the eastern Mediterranean. The rise of Ancient Greece often strikes its 
many awestruck admirers as miraculous; but it may not have been entirely 
fortuitous. 

No doubt a touch of caution should be added to prevailing comment on 'the 
most amazing period of human history'. Modern opinion has been so saturated 
by the special pleading both of the Enlightenment and of Romanticism that it is 
often difficult to see ancient Greece for what it was. Johann Joachim 
Winckelmann (1717-68), 'The Discoverer', sometime Prefect of Antiquities at 
Rome, invented an aesthetic scheme which has deeply affected European 
attitudes to Greece ever since. In his Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek 
Works... (1755) and his History of Art Among the Ancients (1764), he wrote of 
'the noble simplicity and serene greatness' and 'the perfect law of art' which 
supposedly infused everything Greek.- The motto was taken to be 'Nothing in 
excess' or 'Moderation in all things'. One can now suspect that many classical 
scholars have imposed interpretations which owed more than they knew to the 
rationalism and restraint of Winckelmann's era. It was not the fashion to give 
emphasis either to the irrational element in Greek life or to its sheer joie de vivre. 
The philhellenic Romantics of the nineteenth century held priorities of their own. 
First there came John Keats with his 'Ode on a Grecian Urn': 



Map 6. Prehistoric Europe 


O Attic shape! fair attitude! with brede 


of marble men and maidens overwrought, 


With forest branches and the trodden weed: 


Thou silent form! dost tease us out of thought 
As does eternity. Cold Pastoral! 

When old age shall this generation waste, 

Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe 
Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st, 
'Beauty is truth, truth beauty,-that is all 
Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.' 


Then there is Shelley enthusing on 'Hellas': 

The world's great age begins anew, 
The golden years return, 

The earth doth like a snake renew 








Her winter weeds outworn. 

Heaven smiles, and faiths and empires gleam 
Like wrecks of a dissolving dream. 

Above all, there was the young Lord Byron dreaming about 'The Isles of 
Greece': 

Place me on Sunium's marbled steep 
Where nothing save the waves and I 
May hear our mutual murmurs sweep. 

There, swan-like, let me sing and die.= 

The Romantics wrote on Greece with beguiling genius; and it is not 
surprising that they can Tease us out of thought'. Even the most distinguished 
critics can lose their critical faculties. One of them can be found writing on 
Greek literature about 'results so satisfactory in form and so compelling in 
substance that their work has often been held up as a type of perfection'. 
Another can be found waxing on the joys of digging 'at any classical or sub- 
classical site in the Greek world ... where practically every object you find will 
be beautiful'. Yet another claimed that 'the spirit of Ancient Greece ... hath so 
animated universal nature that the very rocks and woods, the very torrents and 
wilds burst forth with it'. It may be that moderns are fired by nostalgia for a time 
when the world was young, or moved by a misplaced desire to prove the 
uniqueness of ancient Greece. Or perhaps, in marvelling at the surviving 
masterpieces, they forget the dross which has not survived. It was 'a liberal 
education even to walk in the streets of that wonderful city', wrote a popular 
historian of Athens, 'to worship in her splendid shrines, to sail the Mediterranean 
in her fleets '.- 

Negative aspects can undoubtedly be found by those who seek them. Those 
noble Greeks, who are so admired, were none the less surrounded by 'degrading 
superstitions, unnatural vices, human sacrifice, and slavery'.' Many 
commentators compare the high-minded vigour of the early period with the 
violence and decadence of later centuries. Still, the facts remain. When the 
civilization of Ancient Greece first came into focus, its links to the older worlds 
of Egypt and Mesopotamia were tenuous, [black athena] [cadmus] [epic] Yet in 
the space of three or four hundred years it had created breathtaking achievements 
in almost every field of human endeavour. European history knows no such burst 


of vital energy until the era of the Renaissance. For Greece, apparently, did not 
develop slowly and methodically. It blazed. 

" - " 


The political history of Ancient Greece spanned more than a thousand years, and 
passed through several distinct ages. The initial prehistoric age, which looked to 
the twin centres of Minoan and Mycenean civilization, came to an end in the 
twelfth century bc. In its later stages it coincided to a large extent with the so- 
called 'Heroic Age' which culminated in the Trojan War, and which later Greek 
literature peopled with the legendary names of Hercules, Ajax, Achilles, and 
Agamemnon. Troy was built on the Asian side of the Aegean which, especially 
in Ionia, supported the major centres of Greek settlement for centuries. The 
traditional date for Troy's fall is 1184 bc. Excavations have shown that the 
historical basis of the legends is stronger than was once supposed. 

After that, an extended 'Dark Age' ensued, where the historical and even the 
archaeological record is meagre. 

The 'Golden Age' of the Greek city-states lasted from the eighth to the fourth 
centuries, and itself passed through several distinct periods. The Archaic period 
reached the historical record with the first Olympiad whose traditional date of 
776 bc was to be adopted as the arbitrary starting-point of the Greek chronology. 
The central period of Greece's greatest glory began in the fifth century and 
ended in 338 bc, when the Greeks were forced to surrender to the Macedonians. 
Thereafter, in the period of dependence, the Greek cities laboured under foreign 
rule, first Macedonian, then Roman, [eco] [nomisma] 

The principal conflicts of this Golden Age were provided by the wars against 
the empire of Persia, which under Cyrus the Great (558-529) absorbed the 
eastern half of the Greek world, and later by the Peloponnesian War (431-404), 
where the Greek cities fought in fratricidal strife. The battles where the invading 
Persians were held and repulsed, at the Plain of Marathon (490 bc), or at the Pass 
of Thermopylae and the Bay of Salamis (480 bc) have inspired endless 
panegyrics. In contrast, Sparta's inglorious victory over Athens in 404 bc, which 
was accomplished with Persian support, or the merciless suppression of Sparta 
by Thebes, have received less attention. 



ECO 


Ecological devastation had already caught the attention of Greek rulers in 
the early sixth century bc. Solon the Law-giver proposed that the cultivation 
of steep slopes should be banned to prevent soil erosion; and Pisistratus 
introduced a bounty for farmers who planted olive trees to counteract 
deforestation and over-grazing. Two hundred years later Plato noted the 
damage inflicted on the land in Attica: 

What now remains compared with what then existed is like the skeleton of a 
sick man, all the fat and soft earth having wasted away.... There are some 
mountains which now have nothing but food for bees, but they had trees not 
long ago ... and boundless pasturage. Moreover, it was enriched by the 
yearly rains from Zeus, which were not lost to it, as now ... [providing]... 
abundant supplies of springwaters and streams, whereof the shrines still 
remain even now, at the spots where the fountains formerly existed. 1 

From the ecological point of view, The adoption of agriculture was the most 
fundamental change in human history'. It is known as the 'First Transition', 
since it created the first form of artificial habitat-the cultivated countryside. 
Europe, in this process, served as a latter-day appendage to the main 
developments in south-west Asia, moving in parallel with China and 
Mesoamerica. But it shared all the consequences-a permanent food surplus 
and hence the potential for demographic growth; an ordered, hierarchical 
society; an increase in social coercion, both in labour and in warfare; the 
emergence of cities, organized trade, and literary culture-and ecological 
disasters. 

Above all, particular ways of thinking about mankind's relationship to 
Nature were engendered. The Judaeo-Christian tradition, which was destined 
to triumph in Europe, derived from the era of the 'First Transition'. It 
stressed Man's supremacy over the rest of Creation: 

Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth. And the fear of you and the 
dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, upon every fowl of the 
air, upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered. 



Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb, 
have I given you all things. (Gen. 9) 

For Thou hast made him [Man,] a little lower than the angels, and hast 
crowned him with glory and honour. 

Thou hast made him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; Thou 
hast put all things under his feet... (Ps. 8) 

The heavens are the Lord's, but the earth he has given to the sons of man. 
(Ps. 115) 2 

Dissident thinkers, such as Maimonides or St Francis, who rejected these 
exploitative nostrums must be counted a distinct minority. 

Nor did attitudes change with the emergence of secular thought during 
the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution (see Chapter VII). 'Man, if we 
look to the final causes,' wrote Francis Bacon, 'must be regarded as the 
centre of the world.' Progress, including open-ended material progress, was 
one of the ideals of the Enlightenment. Mankind was judged perfectible, 
among other things through the application of the new science of economics. 
Yet in the eyes of the true ecologist, 'economics has enthroned some of our 
most unattractive predispositions: material acquisitiveness, competition, 
gluttony, pride, selfishness, shortsightedness, and just plain greed'. 3 

[MARKET] 

Of course, by the time of the Enlightenment, the world was moving into 
the era of the 'Second Transition'. The logic of exploitation was advancing 
from 'the rape of nature', i.e. of renewable botanical and zoological 
resources, to the unbridled consumption of non-renewable resources, 
especially of fossil fuels such as coal and oil. At this stage, Europe definitely 
took the lead. The Industrial Revolution vastly increased the sheer weight of 
human numbers, the urban sprawl, the expectation of affluence, and the rate 
of consumption, pollution, and exhaustion. Above all, it magnified 
mankind's capacity for causing ecological trauma on a scale which Solon 
and Plato could never have imagined. 

It has taken a long time for people to take the effects of a damaged 
environment seriously. When the ex-Emperor Napoleon lay dying at 
Longwood House on St Helena in 1821, his terminal illness aroused much 



disquiet. A post-mortem stated the cause of death to have been abdominal 
cancer. But tests conducted in 1840, when the body was returned to France 
for reburial, revealed traces of arsenic in the hair roots. Earlier suspicions of 
murder seemed confirmed. Various persons in his entourage were named as 
the poisoner. Over a hundred years later, however, a fresh suspicion 
emerged. In the early nineteenth century, arsenic compounds were 
sometimes used to fix the colours of fabrics; and close examinations at 
Longwood House showed that a strong constituent of arsenic was present in 
the wallpaper of the ex-Emperor's specially redecorated rooms. The subject 
still arouses controversy. But it is not beyond possibility that Napoleon's 
death was a case not of murder but of environmental pollution. 4 (See p. 762.) 


The Persian Wars gave a permanent sense of identity to the Greeks who 
escaped Persian domination. Free Hellas was seen as the 'Glorious West', 'the 
Land of Liberty', the home of Beauty and Wisdom. The East was the seat of 
slavery, brutality, ignorance. Aeschylus put these sentiments into the mouth of 
the Queen of Persia. The scene is the royal palace at Susa, where news has 
arrived of her son's defeat at Salamis: 


NOMISMA 

Nomisma, meaning 'coin', was used by both Greeks and Romans. Our 
own word 'money' derives, via the French monnaie, from the Latin moneta, 
meaning the mint, where coins are struck. (In early Rome the mint was 
situated on the Capitoline Hill in the temple of Juno Moneta.) 

Money, in the sense of coinage, began to circulate in the Aegean in the 
early seventh century bc. According to Herodotus it was the Kingdom of 
Lydia which minted the first coins. A stater or two-drachma piece of 
electrum, an alloy of gold and silver, struck either in Lydia or in Ionia, is 
often described as the world's oldest coin. 1 Certainly the kings of Phrygia, 
from the legendary Midas, whose touch turned everything to gold, to 
Croesus (r. 561-546 BC), whose name was synonymous with fabulous 





wealth, were closely connected with the origins of money. They owned the 
'golden sands' of the River Pactolus, near the Lydian capital, Sardis. 

The island of Aegina also participated in the early days of coinage. 
Aegina's silver coins, introduced in 670 bc, were certainly the first in 
Europe. Stamped with the emblem of a sea tortoise, they mark the beginning 
both of the widespread 'aeginetic' system of weights and measures and of 
numismatic art. 2 Each of the subsequent mints adopted a similar emblem- 
the owl or the olive-branch for Athens, the pegasus for Corinth, the 
Arethusan nymph for Syracuse. From an early date, heads of divinities and 
inscriptions identifying the mint or the ruling authority were also common. 
Coins bearing the head of the ruler did not come into fashion until 
Hellenistic times, but were the norm under the Roman Empire. 

Numismatics, the study of coins, is one of history's auxiliary sciences. It 
deals with some of the most durable evidence of ancient times, and is 
particularly valuable for dating the layers of archaeological sites. Coins 
struck in hard metal speak with great precision about time and space. They 
bear witness not only to material conditions but also to the ramifications of 
international trade and cultural contacts. 

From the seventh century Aegean coins have spread throughout the 
world. They form the basis of most monetary systems and of most 
commercial exchange. The right to mint coins has become one of the 
hallmarks of political sovereignty. 1,500 mints are known from ancient 
Greece alone. The Lydian stater has its descendants in the coinage of Rome, 
of Christian Europe, and now of all countries. Like the silver drachma of 
Aegina, some coins have gained currency far beyond the times and the 
territories for which they were intended. Indeed, the charisma of nomisma 
became so powerful that many came to fear it. 'The love of money', wrote St 
Paul from Macedonia in ad 65, 'is the root of ah evil.' [dollar]

The notion that Greece was all liberty, and Persia all tyranny, was an extremely 
subjective one. But it provided the foundation of a tradition which has 
persistently linked 'civilization' with 'Europa' and 'the West' (see Introduction, 
p. 22). [BARBAROS] 

The rise of Macedonia, a hellenized country to the north of Greece, reached 
its peak in the reigns of Philip of Macedon (r. 359-336 bc) and of Philip's son, 
Alexander the Great (r. 336-323 bc). In a series of campaigns of unparalleled 
brilliance, which ended only with Alexander's death from fever in Babylon, the 
whole of Persia's vast domains were overrun and the Greek world was extended 
to the banks of the Indus. According to one admiring opinion, Alexander was the 
first man to view the whole known world, the oikoumene, as one country. But for 
the senior English historian of Greece, at the end of his twelfth volume and his 
96th chapter, the passing of 'Free Hellas' was to be lamented even more than 
Alexander was to be praised. 'The historian feels that the life has departed from 
his subject,' he wrote, 'and with sadness and humiliation brings his narrative to a 
close.'- In the political sense, this Hellenistic Age, which began with the 
Macedonian supremacy, lasted until the systematic elimination of Alexander's 
successors by the growing power of Rome, [makedon] 

The geographical expansion of the Greek world was impressive. The 
miniature island- and city-states which ringed the stony shore of the Aegean 
often lacked the resources to support a growing population. Arable land was at a 
premium. Commercial outlets grew, even without a modern sense of enterprise. 
Friendly trading-posts were needed for effective contacts with the continental 
interior. For all these reasons, the foundation of clone colonies offered many 
attractions. From the eighth century onwards, therefore, several of the most 
ancient cities of the Greek mainland and of Asia Minor-Chalcis, Eretria, 
Corinth, Megara, Phocaea, and, above all, Miletus-were engaged in active 
colonization. The most frequent locations were found in Sicily and southern 
Italy, in Thrace, and on the coasts of the Euxine or 'Hospitable' Sea-so named, 
like the Pacific, in the hope that its name might offset its nature, [chersonesos] 

In time, as the early colonies themselves gave birth to further colonies of 


their own, whole chains or families of cities were established, each with its 
lasting devotion to the parent foundation. Miletus constructed the largest of such 
families, with up to eighty members of various generations. In the west, in Sicily, 
the first Chalcidian colonies, Naxos and Messana (Messina), dated from 735 bc. 
Emporia (Ampurias) in Iberia, Massilia (Marseille), Neapolis (Naples), 
Syracusae (Syracuse), Byzantium on the Bosporus, Cyrene in North Africa, and 
Sinope on the southern Euxine shore all date from the same early centuries. At a 
later date, following the conquests of Alexander the Great, Greek cities arose in 
the depths of Asia. Foundations which bore the name of the Macedonian 
conqueror included Alexandria-at-World's-End (Khojent, in Turkestan), 
Alexandria in Areia (Herat), Alexandria in Arachosia (Kandahar), Alexandria in 
Syria, and, above all, Alexandria in Egypt (332 bc). From Saguntum (Sagunto 
near Valencia) in the far west to Bucephala (Jhelum) in the Punjab at the eastern 
extremity, named after Alexander's faithful charger, the interlinked chains of 
Greek cities stretched for almost 4,500 miles, that is, for almost twice the 
distance across North America, [massilia] (See Appendix III, p. 1222.) 


BARBAROS 

Every textbook stresses the formative influence of the Persian Wars in 
uniting the people of Tree Hellas' and in fixing their sense of Greek identity. 
Less obvious is the fact that those same wars set in motion a process 
whereby the Greeks would define their view of the outside, 'barbarian' 
world. Yet 'inventing the Hellene' went hand in hand with 'inventing the 
barbarian'; and Athenian drama of the 5th century provided the medium 
through which the effect was achieved. 1 

Prior to Marathon and Salamis, the Greeks do not appear to have 
harboured strong feelings about their neighbours as enemies. Archaic poetry 
had often made heroes out of supernatural outsiders, including Titans and 
Amazons. Homer treated Greeks and Trojans as equals. Greek colonies on 
the Black Sea Coast lived from fruitful co-operation and interchange with 
the Scythians of the steppe, [chersonesos] 

In the 5th century, however, the Greeks became much more self- 
congratulatory and xenophobic. One finds the ethnic factor raised by 




Herodotus (b. 484), who, whilst appreciating the older civilizations, 
especially Egypt, laid great store by the 'shared blood 5 and common 
language of the Hellenes. 

But the most effective catalysts of changing attitudes were the 
tragedians, especially Aeschylus (b. 525), who had himself fought at 
Marathon. In his Persae, Aeschylus creates a lasting stereotype whereby the 
civilized Persians are reduced to cringing, ostentatious, arrogant, cruel, 
effeminate, and lawless aliens. 

Henceforth, all outsiders stood to be denigrated as barbarous. No one 
could compare to the wise, courageous, judicious, and freedom-loving 
Greeks. The Thracians were boorish and mendacious. The Macedonians 
were not echte hellenisch. By Plato's time, a permanent barrier had been 
raised between Greeks and all foreigners. It is assumed that the Greeks alone 
had the right and the natural disposition to rule. In Athens, it was simply not 
done to liken the conduct of foreign tyrants to the ways that Athenians could 
themselves behave towards subject peoples. 

The 'superiority complex' of the ancient Greeks inevitably raises 
questions about similar ethnocentric and xenophobic ideas which surface in 
Europe at later dates. It was certainly adopted by the Romans, and must be 
held in the reckoning when one considers the various purveyors of 'Western 
Civilization' who, like the Romans, have felt such an affinity for ancient 
Greece. Nor can it be irrelevant to the resentments which combine attacks on 
'Western Civilization' with a particular brand of Classical revisionism. 
[black athena] Some commentators hold that the conclusions which the 
ancient Greeks drew from their encounter with the otherness of neighbouring 
peoples have passed into the body of European tradition: 

In this particular encounter began the idea of 'Europe' with all its arrogance, 
all its implications of superiority, all its assumptions of priority and antiquity, 
all its pretensions to a natural right to dominate. 2 


Sicily and southern Italy (then known as Magna Graecia or 'Greater Greece') 
had a special role to play. They developed the same relationship with the Greek 
mainland that the Americas would develop with Europe. Until the Persian 
conquest of Asia Minor in the sixth century, the focus had remained very firmly 




in the Aegean. Miletus had been an even larger and more prosperous city than 
Athens. But once 'Europa' came under threat, first from Persia and then from 
Macedonia and Rome, the cities of Magna Graecia assumed a new importance. 
Sicily, full of luxury and tyrants, thrived on its special symbiosis with the 
surrounding Phoenician world. Syracuse was for Athens what New York was to 
be for London. On Greek Sicily and its internecine wars, Michelet waxed 
specially eloquent: 

It grew in gigantic proportions. Its volcano, Etna, put Vesuvius to shame ... and the surrounding towns 
responded to its grandeur. The herculean hand of the Dorians can be seen in the remains of Acragas 
(Agrigentum), in the columns of Posidonia (Paestum), in the white phantom that is Selinonte... Yet the 
colossal power of these cities, their prodigious riches, their naval forces ... did nothing to retard their ruin. 
In the history of Magna Graecia, one defeat spelt disaster. Thus Sybaris and Agrigentum passed from the 
world, the Tyre and the Babylon of the West.. .- 

Magna Graecia commanded a region of great strategic importance, where the 
Greek world came into direct contact with the rival spheres first of the 
Phoenicians and then of Rome. 

Phoenicia, homeland of Europa, flourished in parallel to Greece and in 
similar style. Indeed, Phoenicia's city-states were considerably senior to their 
Greek counterparts, as were the Phoenician colonies. Sidon and Tyre had risen to 
prominence at the time when Crete was in terminal decline. Kart-hadshat, or 
'New City' (Kartigon, Carthago, Carthage) had been founded in North Africa in 
810 bc, reputedly by Phoenician colonists led by Pygmalion and his sister Dido. 
Neighbouring Atiq (Utica) was still older. When old Phoenicia was overrun, like 
Asia Minor, by the Persians, Carthage and Utica were left, like the cities of the 
Greek mainland, to thrive on their own. 

Carthage built a huge empire through naval power, trade, and colonization. 
Its daughter colonies stretched from beyond the Pillars of Hercules at Gades 
(Cadiz) 

and Tingis (Tangier) to Panormus (Palermo) on Sicily. In its heyday it was 
probably the most prosperous of all city-states, dominating all the islands and 
coasts of the western Mediterranean. From the fifth century onwards, it fought 
and destroyed many of the Greek cities of Sicily, where its ambitions were cut 
short only by the arrival of Roman power. 


CHERSONESOS 


CHERSONESOS, 'Peninsular City', was founded in 422-421 bc by Dorian 
colonists from Heraclea Pontica. It stood on a headland on the western coast 
of the peninsula of Taurica,* 3 km beyond modern Sevastopol. It was one of 
a score of Greek cities on the northern shore of the Euxine Sea, most of them 
colonies of Miletus-Olbia ('Prosperity'), Panticapaeum on the Cimmerian 
Bosphorus (The Straits of Kerch), Tanais on the Don, Phanagoria, and 
others. Its foundation coincided very closely with the visit to neighbouring 
Olbia of the historian, Herodotus, who recorded the first description of the 
Scythian and Tauric peoples inhabiting the Pontic steppes. Like its 
neighbours, it lived from commerce with the inland tribes, and from the 
resulting seaborne trade in wheat, wine, hides, and salted fish. Its population 
of perhaps 20,000 inhabited a typical grid of straight stone streets, replete 
with the usual agora, acropolis, theatre, and port. 1 

Exceptionally, Chersonesos survived all the turbulence of the next 1,700 
years, passing through successive Greek, Sarmatian, Roman, and Byzantine 
phases. After its initial period as a solitary Greek outpost, it was absorbed in 
the 2nd century bc by the growing 'Kingdom of the Bosphorus', based at 
nearby Panticapaeum. The Kingdom, whose huge wealth grew from the 
grain trade, especially with Athens, was dominated by the latest wave of 
immigrants from the steppe, the Iranic Sarmatians, whose ability to 
assimilate into preceding Greek civilization created a brilliant new synthesis. 
Its goldsmiths, who worked to order for the Scythian chiefs of the interior, 
produced some of the most magnificent artistic jewellery of the ancient 
world. Its Spartocid dynasty, which was not Greek, eventually sought the 
protection of Mithridates VI Eupator, King of Pontus-the subject of 
Mozart's early opera, Mitridate, Re di Ponto -who died in Panticapaeum in 
63 bc (the acropolis at Kerch is still called Mount Mithridates). The Roman 
garrison, installed at that time, did not impose full imperial rule for nearly 
two centuries. 

Despite repeated invasions, particularly by the Goths, Huns, and 
Khazars, the late Roman/early Byzantine period saw some fifty Christian 
churches built at Chersonesos. In one of them, in 988 or 991, the latest 





barbarian visitor, Prince Wolodymyr (or Vladimir) of Kiev, stepped into the 
marble pool of the baptistery to be christened before his marriage to the 
Byzantine Emperor's sister. By that time, Khazar overlordship had waned, 
and the Byzantines were able to re-establish Chersonesos as capital of the 
Theme of Klimata. 2 The final destruction of the 'Peninsular City' came in 
1299 at the hands of the Mongol Tartars, who were busy turning Crimea into 
their homeland. It lived to see neither the arrival of the Ottomans in the 
fifteenth century nor the Russian conquest of 1783. 

Excavations at Chersonesos began in 1829. They were intensified before 
the First World War, and resumed in the 1920s by a Soviet Archaeological 
Commission. The Tsarists were mainly looking for evidence of St Vladimir's 
baptism. In 1891 they erected a vast domed basilica, now shattered, on the 
wrong spot. The Soviets were looking for remains of the material culture of 
a slave-owning society. 3 

Possession of the classical Black Sea sites gave their modern owners a 
strong sense of historical pride. The naval port of Sevastopol was founded 
beside the ruins of Chersonesos with an appropriate Greek name meaning 
'City of Glory'. The Tauride Palace in St Petersburg, built for the conqueror 
of Crimea, Prince Potemkin, started Russia's 'native classical style'. After 
the attack of the British and French in 1854-6, and the heroic Russian 
defence, the Crimean coast became a favourite resort for the summer palaces 
of tsarist courtiers and Soviet Party bosses. They all justified their presence 
through the dubious Russian Version of History that starts with St Vladimir. 
In 1941-2, after a second heroic siege of Sevastopol, the Crimea was briefly 
occupied by the Nazis, whose 'Gotland Project' would have returned the 
peninsula into the hands of German colonists. In 1954, on the tercentenary of 
another dubious event, the Soviet Government in Moscow presented Crimea 
to Ukraine. The gift was intended to symbolize the indissoluble links of 
Crimea and Ukraine with Russia. Instead, on the collapse of the USSR, it 
had exactly the opposite effect. In August 1991, the last Soviet General 
Secretary was caught holidaying in his villa at Foros, along the coast from 
Sevastopol, when the abortive coup in Moscow brought the Soviet era to an 
end. 4 (See p. 1126.) 

In recent times, the great variety of Crimea's native population has all 
but disappeared. The ancient Tauri and Tauro-Scythians were long since 
over-run. The Crimean Goths defended their inland stronghold of Mangup 



until 1475. The Tartars were deported en masse by Stalin in 1942. 5 The 
Pontic Greeks survived until their deportation in 1949. A handful of Jews, 
who had escaped the Nazis, left for Israel in the 1980s. Russians and 
Ukrainians were left in an absolute majority. 

In 1992, as families of the ex-Soviet military from Sevastopol shared the 
pebbly beach with the tourists, seeking their suntans beneath the ruined 
clifftop columns of Chersonesos, they looked on anxiously at the returning 
Tartars, at Ukrainian claims to the Black Sea Fleet, and at Russian demands 
for an autonomous Crimean republic. No location could have reminded them 
more of the impermanence of glory. 


MASSILIA 

MaSSILIA (Marseille) was founded c.600 BC by Greeks from Phocaean 
Asia Minor. According to legend Photis, their leader, sailed his galley into 
the harbour just as the chieftain of the local Ligurian tribe was holding a 
betrothal ceremony for his favourite daughter. When the girl was invited to 
hand the cup of betrothal to one of the assembled warriors, she handed it 
instead to the handsome Greek. Thus began one of the richest and most 
dynamic of all Greek colonies. 

Surrounded by high white-stone crags and guarded by an offshore island, 
the magnificent harbour of ancient Massilia has served as a major centre of 
commercial and cultural life for more than 2,500 years. The government was 
a merchant oligarchy. A Great Council of 600 citizens, elected for life, 
appointed a smaller Council of Fifteen, which formed the executive. The 
trade and exploration of the Massiliots spread far and wide. They dominated 
the sea from Luna in Tuscany to the south of Iberia, and they set up trading- 
posts at Nicaea (Nice), Antipolis (Antibes), Rhoda (Arles), and distant 
Emporia, all dedicated to their own patron goddess, the Ephesian Artemis. 
Their sailors did not fear the ocean beyond the Pillars of Hercules, and were 
reputed to have reached Iceland in the north, and what is now Senegal in the 
south. One daring fourth-century Massiliot, Pytheas, navigated the northern 
coasts of Europe including the 'Tin Islands' (as Herodotus called Britain). 




His lost 'Survey of the Earth' was known to Strabo and Polybius. 

Faced with the jealous rivalry of the Phoenicians and Carthaginians, 
Massilia had often appealed to Rome for support. But they did so once too 
often. In 125 bc when they called for military aid against the Gauls, the 
Roman legions overran the entire country, thereby creating the Province of 
Transalpine Gaul (Provence). From this a trilingual community grew up, 
speaking Greek, Fatin, and Celtic. Thereafter, the city's life mirrored all the 
changes of Mediterranean politics-Arabs, Byzantines, Genoans, and, from 
1481, the French. The greatest days of Marseilles's prosperity started in the 
nineteenth century, with the opening of French interests in the Fevant. 
Napoleon's expedition to Egypt, and the building of the Suez Canal by de 
Fesseps, were key episodes. 

Modern Marseilles, like ancient Massilia, is still ruled by the sea. Fe 
Vieux Port, immortalized by the dramatic trilogy of Marcel Pagnol, has been 
superseded by the vast Port Autonome beyond the digue. But the turbulent 
emotions of Fanny, Marius, and Cesar, hopelessly torn by the tearful 
departures and arrivals of the ships, are constantly repeated: 

fanny. Et toi, Marius, tu ne m'aimes pas? [// se tait]... 

marius. Je te l'ai deja dit, Fanny. Je ne peux pas me marier. 

fanny. Alors, c'est quelque vilaine femme des vieux quartiers.... Dis-le 
moi. Marius ... 

marius. J'ai confiance en toi. Je vais te le dire. Je veux partir. 1 

(Marius, don't you love me? / I've told you already, Fanny, I can't marry 
you. / Oh, I see: it's one of those nasty women from the old town ... Go on, 
say it. / No. I trust no-one but you, Fanny. I'm about to tell you. I want to 
leave./) 

From the terrace of Notre Dame de la Garde, perched high on the site of a 
Greek temple, one can still gaze down on the ships slipping into the harbour 
like the galleys of Photis. Or, like the Count of Monte Cristo in the Chateau 
d'lf, or like Marius, one can dream of escape across the sea. 2 


The Phoenicians and Carthaginians, like Jews and Arabs, were Semites. As 




the ultimate losers in the struggle for supremacy in the Mediterranean, they did 
not enjoy the sympathy either of the Greeks or of the Romans. As idolaters of 
Baal, the ultimate graven image, they have always been singled out for derision 
by followers of the Judaeo-Christian tradition, which the Graeco-Roman world 
eventually adopted. Though Europa's Phoenician kinsfolk held sway for a 
millennium and more, their civilization is very little known or studied. Their 
story may have suffered from yet another variant of antisemitism. 

Greek religion progressed from early animism and fetishism to a view of the 
world seen as 'one great City of gods and men'. The Olympian pantheon was 
already extant in the late prehistoric age. Zeus, Father of the Gods, and Hera, his 
consort, ruled over the headstrong family of Olympians-Apollo, Artemis, 
Pallas Athene, Ares, Poseidon, Hermes, Dionysus, Demeter, Pluto, and 
Persephone. Their home on the summit of Mount Olympus was generally taken 
to stand on the northern frontier of the Greek homeland. They were joined by a 
rich gallery of local deities, satyrs, shades, nymphs, furies, sibyls, and muses, to 
whom the Greeks paid their oblations. The ritual sacrifice of animals remained 
the normal practice. Though it was the prerogative of the gods to be capricious, 
and though some, such as Ares, God of War, or Poseidon, God of the Sea, could 
be vengeful, there was no Devil, no power of darkness or sin to prey on people's 
deeper fears. Man's supreme fault was hubris or overweening pride, commonly 
punished by nemesis, the wrath of the gods, [spice-ox] 

A thousand myths, and a dazzling choice of cults and oracles, proliferated. 
They fostered an outlook where courage and enterprise, tempered by respect, 
were thought to be rewarded by health and fortune. The cult of Zeus, centred at 
Olympia, which hosted the Olympic Games, was universal, as was the 
combination of piety and competitive endeavour. The widespread cult of Apollo, 
God of Light, was centred at his birthplace on the island of Delos, and at Delphi. 
The Mysteries of Demeter, Goddess of the Earth, at Eleusis, and the still more 
ecstatic Mysteries of Dionysus, God of Wine, developed from ancient fertility 
rites. The cult of Orpheus the Singer, who had pursued his dead love, Eurydice, 
through the underworld, turned on a belief in the existence and purification of 
souls. Orphism, which lasted from the seventh century until late Roman times, 
inspired endless poetic comment, from Plato and Virgil onwards: 



SPICE-OX 


Pythagoras (fl . c.530 bc) gave voice to two well-known maxims: 
'Everything is numbers' and 'Eating beans is a crime equal to eating the 
heads of one's parents'. Scholars concerned with the origins of modern 
science study his mathematics. Those concerned with the working of the 
Greek mind study his ideas on gastronomy. (See Appendix III, p. 1221.) 

Like the Pilgrim Fathers of a later age, Pythagoras was a religious 
dissenter, and sailed away from his native Samos to found a sectarian colony 
in Magna Graecia. There he found the freedom to apply his religious 
theories, among other things to food and diet. His central contention sprang 
from the concept of metempsychosis, 'the transmigration of souls', which 
could pass after death from person to person, or from persons to animals. As 
a result, he was opposed in principle to the custom of animal sacrifices, and 
held that the perfume of heated herbs and spices was a more fitting offering 
to the gods than the stench of roasted fat. 

But if spices formed the link with Heaven, beans were the link with 
Hades. Broad beans, whose nodeless shoots relentlessly push their way to 
the sunlight, were thought to act as 'ladders for the souls of men' migrating 
from the underworld. Beans propagated in a closed pot produced a seething 
mess of obscene shapes reminiscent of sexual organs and aborted foetuses. 
Similar taboos were placed on the consumption of the noble meats, 
especially of beef. Some creatures like the pig and the goat, which root 
around and damage nature, were judged harmful, and hence edible. Others, 
like the sheep, which gives wool, and the 'working ox', man's most faithful 
companion, were judged useful, and hence inedible. Joints of ignoble meat 
could be eaten, if necessary, but the vital organs such as the heart or the brain 
could not. According to Aristoxenos of Tarentum, the resultant diet consisted 
of maza (barley meal), wine, fruit, wild mallow and asphodel, artos 
(wheatbread), raw and cooked vegetables, opson seasoning, and, on special 
occasions, suckling pig and kid. Once, an ox rescued by Pythagoras from a 
beanfield was given a lifelong pension of barley meal in the local Temple of 
Hera. 

More famously, when Pythagoras' disciple, Empedocles of Acragas, won 
the chariot race at Olympia in 496 bc, he refused to offer up the customary 
sacrifice of a roasted ox. Instead, he burned the image of an ox made from 



oil and spices, saluting the gods amidst a billowing cloud of frankincense 
and myrrh. The Pythagoreans believed that diet was an essential branch of 
ethics. 'So long as men slaughter animals,' the master said, 'they won't stop 
killing each other.' 1 [konopipjte] 


Nur wer die Leier schon hob 
auch unter Schatten, 
darf das unendliche Lob

Nur wer mit Toten vom Mohn

wird nicht den leisesten Ton

Mag auch die Spieglung im Teich 
oft uns verschwimmen: 

Wzsse das Bild. 

Erst in dem Doppelbereich 
werden die Stimmen 
ewig und mild. 

(Only he who has raised the lyre even among the shades can dispense the infinite 
praise. Only he who ate of their poppy with the Dead will never lose even the 
softest note. Though the reflection in the pond may often dissolve before us 
-Know the image! Only in the double realm will the voices be lasting and 
gentle.)- 

All these cults, as well as the Hellenistic cults of Mithras and Isis, were still in 
full circulation when Christianity arrived in the period after the 200th Olympiad 
(see Chapter III), [omphalos] 

Greek philosophy, or 'love of wisdom', grew up in opposition to 
conventional religious attitudes. Socrates (469-399 bc), son of a stonemason, 
was sentenced in Athens to drink hemlock for 'introducing strange gods' and 
'corrupting youth'. Yet the Socratic method of asking penetrating questions in 
order to test the assumptions which underlie knowledge provided the basis of all 





subsequent rational thought. It was used by Socrates to challenge what he 
regarded as the specious arguments of the earlier Sophists or 'sages'. His motto 
was 'Life unexamined is not worth living'. According to his disciple Plato, 
Socrates said: 'All I know is that I know nothing.' It was the perfect start for 
epistemology. 

Plato (c.429-347 bc) and Plato's own disciple Aristotle (384-322 bc) 
together laid the foundations of most branches of speculative and natural 
philosophy. Plato's Academy or 'Grove' and Aristotle's Lyceum, otherwise 
known as the Peripatetic School, were the Oxford and Cambridge (or Harvard 
and Yale) of the ancient world. With them in mind, it has been said: 'the legacy 
of the Greeks to Western Philosophy was Western Philosophy'. 2 Of the two 
Plato was the idealist, creating the first imaginary utopias, fundamental theories 
of forms and of immortality, an influential cosmogony, a far-ranging critique of 
knowledge, and a famous analysis of love. Nothing in intellectual history is more 
powerful than Plato's metaphor of the cave, which suggests that we can only 
perceive the world indirectly, seeing reality only by means of its firelit shadows 
on the wall. Aristotle, in contrast, was 'the practitioner of inspired common 
sense', the systematizer. His encyclopedic works range from metaphysics and 
ethics to politics, literary criticism, logic, physics, biology, and astronomy. 

Greek literature, initially in the form of epic poetry, was one of those wonders 
which apparently came into being in a mature state. Homer, who probably lived 
and wrote in the middle of the eighth century bc, was exploiting a much older 
oral tradition. He may or may not have been the sole author of the works 
attributed to him. But the first poet of European literature is widely considered to 
have been the most influential. The Iliad and the Odyssey have few peers, and no 
superiors. Homer's language, which classicists call 'sublime', proved to be 
infinitely flexible and expressive, [epic] 

Written literature depends on literacy, whose origins go back to the 
importation of an alphabet in the eighth century. The art of letters was greatly 
encouraged by the urban character of Greek life, but the extent of its penetration 
into the various social strata is a matter of some controversy, [cadmus] 

Homer's successors-his fellow epicists from Hesiod (fl. c.700 bc) to the 
unknown author(s) of the so-called 'Homeric Hymns'; the elegists from Callinus 
of Ephesus (fl. from 690 bc) to Xenophanes of Colophon (c.570-480 bc); the 
lyricists from Sappho (b. 612 bc) to Pindar (518-438 bc), from Anacreon (fl. 


c.530 bc) to Simonides of Ceos (556-468 bc) -have attracted countless imitators 
and translators. Theocritus the Syracusan (c.300-260 bc) wrote idylls of nymphs 
and goatherds which became the model for a pastoral tradition stretching from 
Virgil's eclogues to As You Like It. But none sang so sweet as the 'tenth muse' of 
Lesbos: 

Some say that the most beautiful thing on this dark earth 
Is a squadron of cavalry; others say 
A troop of infantry, others a fleet of ships; 

But I say that it is the one you love.- 

Poetry-reading was closely allied to music; and the melody of a seven¬ 
stringed lyre served as a common accompaniment to the declaimed hexameters. 
The Greek word musike encompassed all melodious sounds, whether words or 
notes. Poetry was to be found in the simplest inscriptions, in the widespread art 
of epigrams: 


OMPHALOS 

Delphi, in the view of the Greeks, lay at the exact centre of the world. Its 
omphalos or 'navel stone' marked the meeting-place of two of Zeus's eagles, 
one sent from the east and one from the west. Here, too, in a deep valley 
ringed by the dark pines and rose-tinted cliffs of Mt Parnassus, Apollo had 
slain the snake-god Python and, in a steam-filled cave above a gaseous 
chasm, had established the most prestigious of oracles. In historic times, the 
Temple of Apollo was built alongside a theatre, a stadium for the Pythian 
Games, and the numerous treasuries of patron cities. In 331 BC Aristotle and 
his nephew drew up a list of all the victors of the Pythian Games to date. 
Their findings were inscribed on four stone tablets, which survived to be 
found by modern archaeologists. 1 

The procedures of the oracle followed a timeless ritual. On the seventh 
day of each month the high priestess, Pythia, freshly purified in the Castalian 
Spring, would seat herself on the sacred tripod above the chasm and, locked 
in an ecstatic trance among the vapours, would await her petitioners' 
enquiries. The petitioners, having watched the customary sacrifice of a goat, 





would await her notoriously ambiguous responses, delivered in hexameters. 2 

Theseus, the legendary slayer of the Minotaur and founder of Athens, 
was given this comfort: 

THESEUS, SON OF AEGEUS ... DO NOT BE DISTRESSED. FOR AS A LEATHERN 

BOTTLE YOU WILL RIDE THE WAVES EVEN IN A SWELLING SURGE. 

The citizens of Thera, worried by their failing colony on the African 
coast, were told to reconsider its location: 

IF YOU KNOW LIBYA, THE NURSE OF FLOCKS, BETTER THAN I DO, WHEN YOU 

HAVE NOT BEEN THERE ... I ADMIRE YOUR WISDOM. 

Moved to the mainland from its offshore island, Cyrene prospered. 

King Croesus of Lydia wanted to know whether to make war or to keep 
the peace. The Oracle said: 'go to war and destroy a great empire.' He went to war, 
and his empire was destroyed. 

Before Salamis in 480 bc, an Athenian delegation implored the aid of 
Apollo against the Persian invaders: 

PALLAS IS NOT ABLE TO APPEASE ZEUS ... BUT WHEN ALL ELSE HAS BEEN 

CAPTURED ... YET ZEUS OF THE BROAD HEAVEN GIVES TO THE TRITON-BORN 

A WOODEN WALL ... TO BLESS YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN. 

Themistocles, the Athenian admiral, rightly deduced that the key to victory 
lay with his wooden ships. 

Lysander, the Spartan general who had entered Athens in triumph at the 
end of the Peloponnesian War, was warned: 

I BID YOU GUARD AGAINST A ROARING HOPLITE AND A SNAKE, CUNNING 

SON OF THE EARTH, WHICH ATTACKS BEHIND THE BACK. 

He was killed by a soldier with the emblem of a snake on his shield. 

Philip of Macedon, notorious for his bribery, was reputedly told 'TO fight 
with silver spears'. More authentically, on preparing to fight the Persians, 
he received this prophecy: 'the bull is garlanded, the end is come, the 
sacrificer is nigh.' Shortly afterwards he was murdered. 

The Roman, Lucius Junius Brutus, consulted the Oracle with two 
companions, and asked about their future: 

YOUNG MEN, HE AMONG YOU WHO FIRST SHALL KISS HIS MOTHER WILL 

HOLD THE HIGHEST POWER IN ROME. 



Brutus' companions took the hint literally, whilst Brutus bent down to kiss 
the earth. In 509 bc Brutus became Rome's first Consul. 

Four centuries later, Cicero asked the Oracle how one achieved the 
highest fame. He was told: 

MAKE YOUR OWN NATURE, NOT THE OPINION OF THE MULTITUDE, THE 

GUIDE OF YOUR LIFE. 

The Emperor Nero, fearing death, was told: 'expect evil from 73'. 
Encouraged, he thought that he might live to be 73. In the event he was 
overthrown and forced to kill himself at the age of 31. Seventy-three turned 
out to be the age of his successor, Galba. 

Most famously, perhaps, when Alexander the Great consulted the Oracle, 
it remained silent. 3 

Belief in the omniscience of the Delphic Oracle is almost as great among 
enthusiastic moderns as it was among the superstitious Greeks of old. For 
scholars, however, the problem lies in distinguishing the Oracle's real 
achievements from its limitless reputation. Sceptics point out that none of 
the alleged predictions was ever recorded in advance of the events to which 
they referred. The amazing powers of the Oracle could never be tested. A 
powerful cult, an efficient publicity machine, and a gullible public were all 
essential elements of the operation. 

Many of the oracle's most famous sayings were inscribed on the walls of 
the Temple of Apollo. These included 'Nothing in Excess' and 'Know 
Thyself'. 4 They became the watchwords of Greek civilization. 


EPIC 

Homer's Iliad and Odyssey were traditionally regarded in Europe not merely 
as the oldest examples of European literature but as the earliest form of high 
literature anywhere. In 1872, however, following excavations of clay tablets 
from the palace library of Assurbanipal at Nineveh, the capital of ancient 
Assyria, the world was introduced to the Epic of Gilgamesh. 

Gilgamesh was already venerable by the time that Homer's poems were 




composed. Indeed, it can be traced back through a Mesopotamian literary 
tradition into the third millennium BC. It begins: 

[Of him who] found out all things, I shall tell the land, 

[Of him who] experienced everything, [I shall teach] the whole. 

He searched [?] lands [?] everywhere. 

He who experienced the whole gained complete wisdom. 

He found out what was secret, and uncovered what was hidden. 

He brought back a tale of times before the flood. 

He had journeyed far and wide, weary and at last resigned, 

He engraved all his toils on memorial tablets of stone. 1 

Initial interest in the Babylonian epic centred on its biblical connections, 
notably on its narration of the Flood and the Ark and the story of Creation. 
But it was not long before scholars noticed echoes of Homer. After all, the 
chronological coincidence was close enough. Assurbanipal was building his 
library at Nineveh in the last quarter of the seventh century BC; Nineveh was 
destroyed in 612, in much the same era that the Homeric poems must have 
found their final form. (See Appendix III, p. 1216.) 

Many textual similarities can be explained by the oral conventions 
practised by all pre-literate epic poets. But many things cannot be so easily 
explained. The opening invocation of Gilgamesh resembles the opening lines 
of the Odyssey both in tone and sentiment: 

Goddess of song, teach me the story of a hero. This was the man of wide- 
ranging spirit who had sacked the sacred city of Troy and who had wandered 
afterwards long and far. Many were those whose cities he viewed and whose 
minds he came to know, many the trouble that vexed his heart... Goddess, 
daughter of Zeus, impart to me in turn some knowledge of all these things, 
beginning where you will. 2 

Stronger still is the case that can be made for the influence of Gilgamesh 
on the Iliad. Both epics turn on a dramatic twist of the plot which occurs 
with the death of one of two inseparable friends. Gilgamesh mourns for 
Enkidu as Achilles mourns for Patroclus. Other episodes, such as that where 
the gods draw lots for the division of the earth, sea, and sky, are strikingly 
similar. What was once rated as 'a possible Greek debt to Assyria' must now 



be upgraded to a probability. 3 If this supposition is correct, the Homeric 
epics not only supply a link between Classical Letters and the countless 
generations of aoidoi, the unlettered bards of the immemorial tradition. They 
also span the gap between the conventional western literary canon and the 
far more ancient writings of non-European literature.

Greek drama evolved out of the ceremonies of religious festivals. The concept of 
tragodia, literally 'goat-song', was originally connected with ritual sacrifice. The 
first Athenian dramas were performed at the festival of Dionysus. Like the 
Games, they were staged in the spirit of competition. The stylized dialogue 
between the players and the chorus provided a vehicle for exploring the most 
terrible psychological and spiritual conflicts. Between them the triad of 
tragedians, Aeschylus (525-456), Sophocles (c.496-406), and Euripides (c.480- 
406), turned tribal myth and legend into the foundation-stones of world 
literature. Seven Against Thebes, the Oresteia, and Prometheus Bound; Oedipus 
the King, Electro, and Antigone; Iphigenia among the Taurians, Medea, and 
Hippolytus, represent the remnants of a much larger repertoire. [Oedipus] 

Only thirty-two tragedies have survived; but they continue to be performed 
the world over. They are specially needed by the horror-struck twentieth century. 





Tragedy enables us to live through the unbearable.' The greatest Greek 
tragedies are a constant education in [the] nightmare possibility... that we will 
all end in darkness and despair and suicide.' 'Having boldly looked right into the 
terrible destructiveness of so-called World History, as well as the cruelty of 
nature, the Greek comforts himself.... Art saves him, and through art-life.'- 

The comedians, led by Aristophanes (c.450-385), felt free to poke fun at 
everyone from philosophers to politicians. The Knights, The Birds, The Clouds, 
The Wasps, The Frogs, whose fantastic plots are laced with lavatorial and sexual 
humour, still raise roars of laughter from audiences the world over. Aristophanes 
had a matchless talent for coining unforgettable phrases. He is the inventor of 
Nephelokokkugia, 'Cloudcuckooland'. [schoiastikos] 

It is no exaggeration to say that Greek letters form the launch-pad of the 
humanist tradition. 'Wonders are many,' wrote Sophocles; 'but nothing more 
wonderful than man': 


CADMUS 

Cadmus, son of Agenor, King of Phoenicia, and brother of Europa, features 
in numerous Greek myths. He was honoured as founder of Boeotian Thebes, 
and as importer of the alphabet. Wandering the earth in search of his 
abducted sister, Cadmus consulted the oracle at Delphi. He was told to build 
a city 'wherever a cow would rest'. So he followed a likely bovine from 
Phocis into the plain of Boeotia. He marked the spot where it finally lay 
down beside a hillock, and started to build the Cadmea, the oval acropolis of 
Thebes. The city's inhabitants were bom from the teeth of a dragon which 
Cadmus had slain on the advice of Athena. Athena made him their governor, 
and Zeus gave him a wife, Harmonia. 

Birthplace of Dionysus and Hercules, of the seer, Tiresias, and of the 
magical musician, Amphion, Thebes was also the scene of the tragedy of 
Oedipus and of the Seven Against Thebes. It was the neighbour and 
hereditary rival of Athens; it was the ally and then the destroyer of Sparta; 
and it was destroyed itself by Alexander. [Oedipus] 

The Phoenician alphabet, which Cadmus reputedly brought to Greece, 





was phonetic but purely consonantal. It is known in its basic form from 
before 1200 BC, having, like its partner, Hebrew, supplanted the earlier 
hieroglyphs. A simple system, easily learned by children, it broke the 
monopoly in arcane writing which had been exercised for millennia by the 
priestly castes of previous Middle Eastern civilizations. The names of the 
letters passed almost unchanged into Greek: aleph (alpha) = 'ox', beth (beta) 
= 'house'; gimel (gamma) = 'camel'; daleth (delta) = 'tent door'. The old 
Greek alphabet was produced by adding five vowels to the original sixteen 
Phoenician consonants. It also doubled for use as numerals. In due course, it 
became the ancestor of the main branches of European writing-modern 
Greek, Etruscan, Latin, Glagolitic, and Cyrillic. 1 (See Appendix III, p. 1218) 

The earliest manifestations of the Latin alphabet date from the sixth 
century BC. It was based on a script found in the Chalcidian colonies, such 
as Cumae, in Magna Graecia. It was subsequently adopted and adapted by 
all the languages of western Christendom, from Irish to Finnish, and in 
recent times for many non-European languages, including Turkish. 

The Glagolitic and Cyrillic alphabets were developed from the Greek in 
Byzantine times for the purpose of writing certain Slavonic languages. In 
Orthodox Serbia, 'Serbo-Croat' is written in Cyrillic; in Croatia the same 
language is written in the Latin alphabet, [illyria] 

The angular style of Phoenician, Greek, and Roman scripts was dictated 
by the art of the stone-chisel. The gradual evolution of cursive styles was 
made possible by use of the stylus on wax and of quill on parchment. 

Latin minuscules, which are the basis of modern 'small letters', emerged 
around ad 600, although the Roman majuscules, or 'capitals', have also been 
retained, [palaeo] 

Letters and literature are one of the glories of European civilization. The 
story of Cadmus hints that their roots lay in Asia.

Greek oratory was an art fostered both by the theatre and by the tradition of 
open-air law-courts and political assemblies. Rhetoric, first expounded in The 
Art of Words by Corax of Syracuse (fl. c .465 bc), was studied as a formal subject. 
Of the Ten Attic Orators' from Antiphon to Dinarchus of Corinth, none matched 
the skill of Demosthenes (384-322). In his youth an orphan and a stammerer, he 
overcame all difficulties, drove his arch-rival Aeschines (389-314) into exile, 
and became the acknowledged master both of public speaking and of prose style. 
His series of Philippics argued eloquently and passionately for resistance to 
Philip of Macedon. His oration On the Crown, delivered in his defence at a trial 
in 330 bc, was modestly described by Macaulay as The ne plus ultra of human 
art'. 

Greek art, too, experienced its great awakening-what one leading scholar has 
dared to call The greatest and most astonishing revolution in the whole history of 
Art'.- Modern appreciation is influenced no doubt by those forms which have 
best survived, notably sculpture in stone, architecture, and figure-painting on 
ceramic vases. Even so, the sudden leap from the stiff and gloomy styles of older 
antiquity, the explosive flowering which took place in the sixth and fifth 
centuries, is remarkable. Strongly inspired by spiritual and religious motives, 
Greek artists paid special attention to the human body, seeking, as Socrates 
urged, To represent the workings of the soul' by observing the effect of people's 
inner feelings on the body in action. The two most celebrated statues of Phidias 
(c.490-415 bc) are only known from later copies; but the Parthenon friezes, 
dubiously salvaged by Lord Elgin, speak for themselves, [loot] A century later 
Praxiteles (fl. c.350 bc), a sculptor of almost ethereal ease and grace, was no 
more fortunate than Pheidias in the survival of his masterworks, though the 
Hermes of Olympia and the Aphrodite of Arles attest to his talent. These, 
together with figures of the later period such as the bronze Apollo Belvedere, or 
the Aphrodite of Melos, better known as the 'Venus de Milo', have often been 
taken as ideal models for male and female beauty. By the era of Alexander the 


Great, the Greeks had created 'the pictorial language of half the world'.- 


MOUSIKE 

The Greek term mousike embraced both poetry and the art of contrived 
sound. Both have a long history. 

Ancient Greek music was built on 'modes'. A musical mode, like a scale, 
is a fixed sequence of notes whose intervals provide the basis for melodic 
invention. The Greeks were familiar with six of them; and Pythagorean 
mathematicians correctly calculated the frequencies which underlie their 
component tones, semitones and quarter-tones. The modal system, however, 
does not operate in quite the same manner as the later system of keys and 
scales. A change of mode alters the configuration of the intervals in a 
melodic line, whilst a change of key only alters the pitch. 

In the fourth century St Ambrose selected four so-called 'authentic 
modes' for ecclesiastical use, to which Gregory the Great added four more 
so-called 'plagal modes', making eight 'church modes' in all. These formed 
the basis of plainsong [cantus]. In the sixteenth century the Swiss monk 
Henry of Glarus (Glareanus) set out a full table of twelve modes, giving 
them a confusing series of names which, with one exception, did not 
coincide with the ancient originals:

The development of modern harmony rendered most of the ancient 





modes redundant. But two of them, XI and IX, the Lydian and the Aeolian, 
survived. Known from the seventeenth century onwards as the major and the 
minor variants of the twelve key scales, they supply the twin aspects, the 
'joyful' and the 'mournful', of the melodic system on which most European 
'classical music' is based. Together with time and harmony, they constitute 
one of three basic grammatical elements in the musical language which 
marks Europe off from its Asian and African neighbours. 

Given that Europe has never acquired a universal spoken language, i.e. a 
common verbal musike, Europe's musical idiom, its non-verbal musike, must 
be reckoned the longest and strongest thread of its common culture. Indeed, 
since it extends from Spain to Russia but not to India or to the Islamic world, 
one is tempted to suggest that it is the only universal medium of pan- 
European communication. 


Greek architecture succeeded in harnessing immense technical skill to exquisite 
sensibility. The art of building, which in Mesopotamia and in Egypt had largely 
sought to impress by means of its colossal scale, now aimed to exhibit more 
spiritual values. The finely proportioned harmonies of the Doric temples, with 
their subtly tapered colonnades and sculptured plinths and pediments, could 
convey either heavyweight muscular power, as at the Temple of Poseidon at 
Posidonia (Paestum), or effortless elegance, as in the white Pentelic marble of 
the Athenian Parthenon. The tone and the mood of the temple could be tuned to 
the special characteristics of whatever deity inhabited the enclosed cella or 
'sanctuary' behind the soaring columns. Of the 'Seven Wonders of the World', as 
listed in the second century bc by Antipater of Sidon for the first generation of 
classical tourists, five were masterpieces of Greek architecture. After the 
Pyramids of Egypt and the Hanging Gardens of Semiramis at Babylon, these 
were: the statue of Zeus at Olympia, the (third) Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, 
the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, the Colossus of Rhodes, and the Pharos or 
Lighthouse of Alexandria, [zeus] 

Greek science was simply a branch of general philosophy. Most philosophers 
were concerned with both the physical and the abstract sciences. Thales of 
Miletus (c.636-546), who held that everything derived from water, died fittingly 
by falling down a well. He measured the flood levels of the Nile, the distances 




between ships, and the height of mountains, and he was credited with predicting 
solar eclipses. Heraclitus of Ephesus (f/. c.500), in contrast, considered fire to be 
the primary form of all matter, which was constantly in flux. Anaxagoras of 
Clazomenae (c.500-428), the teacher of Pericles, argued for the existence of a 
supreme Mind or nous which animated all living things and which, by exerting 
its force on infinitely divisible 'seeds', enabled them to combine into all forms of 
matter. He claimed that the planets were stones torn from the earth, and that the 
sun was red-hot through motion. 

Empedocles of Acragas (c.493-433) proposed that the earth is made of four 
'elements': fire, earth, air, and water, and that these elements are constantly 
merging and separating under the contrary stresses of love and strife. He 
reputedly leapt into the crater of Mount Etna in order to test his capacity for 
reincarnation. But the volcano obliged by returning only one sandal. Democritus 
of Abdera (c.460-361) refined the atomic theory of Leucippus, holding that all 
physical matter could be explained in terms of the random collisions of tiny 
particles which he called atoma or 'unbreakables'. He was popularly known as 
the laughing philosopher, because of his amusement at human folly. 


OEDIPUS 

Oedipus 'the Swollen-Foot', King of Thebes, is one of the most ubiquitous 
characters of ancient Greek myth and literature. He also furnishes a prime 
illustration of the Classical Tradition which derives from them. 

The story of Oedipus is that of a Theban outcast who, being rejected by 
his royal parents, is doomed to take the most terrible, though involuntary, 
revenge. Exposed to die as an infant because his father, King Laius, feared a 
bad omen about him, he is saved by a shepherd and is fostered in nearby 
Corinth by people unaware of his origins. Consulting the oracle at Delphi, he 
is told that he will kill his father and marry his mother. For which reason he 
flees Corinth and comes again to Thebes. He kills Laius during a chance 
meeting; solves the riddle of the Sphinx; rids the city of its terror, and as a 
reward, is given the King's widow, Jocasta, his own mother, to wife. After 
fathering four children through this unwittingly incestuous union, he 
discovers the truth, and sees Jocasta hang herself in despair. Thereon he 




blinds himself, and is led into exile by his daughter, Antigone. His end 
comes, at Colonus in Attica, where the tragic wanderer disappears into a 
sacred grove. 

Homer mentions Oedipus in both Iliad and Odyssey. But it is the lost 
epic, Thebais, which was probably the main source of the later story. It then 
becomes the centrepiece of the Theban trilogy of Sophocles, and the 
background to Aeschylus' Seven Against Thebes and to Euripides' 
Suppliants and Phoenician Women. 

Oedipus recurs throughout subsequent European literature. The Roman poet 
Statius wrote an epic Thebaid which in turn was the model for Racine's first 
play La Thebaide (1665). The Roman tragedian Seneca composed a 
variation on Sophocles' Oedipus, inspiring further versions by Corneille 
(1659) and by Andre Gide (1950) and a loose adaptation by the 
contemporary poet, Ted Hughes. Sophocles' Oedipus at Colonnus provides 
the basis both for T. S. Eliot's verse drama The Elder Statesman (1952) and 
Jean Cocteau's Infernal Machine (1934). His Antigone has been followed by 
dramas of the same name and subject by Cocteau, Jean Anouilh (1944), and 
Brecht (1947). Anthony Burgess wrote an Oedipus novel entitled MF 
(1971). There are two paintings of Oedipus and the Sphinx (1808) by Ingres. 
There is an opera-oratorio Oedipus-Rex (1927) by Stravinsky set to 
Cocteau's Latin libretto, and a film, Oedipus-Rex (1967) by Pasolini. 1 

By far the best known use of the legend, however, was made by Sigmund 
Freud who gave the label of 'Oedipus Complex' to the repressed hostility of 
boys to their fathers. Deriving from the rivalry of father and son for the 
mother's affection, the syndrome can lead in later life to a pathological 
mother-fixation. 

The Classical Tradition, which may be defined as the creative reworking of 
ancient themes for contemporary purposes, draws on thousands of such 
examples. Nourished since the Renaissance by five centuries of education in 
Greek and Latin, it has supplied a body of knowledge with which all 
educated Europeans have been familiar. Together with Christianity, it has 
provided a stream within 'the bloodstream of European Culture' and 'a code 
of instant recognition'. Its decline in the late 20th century has been 
precipitated by changing social and educational priorities. Its advocates 



argue that its survival is essential if European civilization is not to wither 
from alienation. 


SCHOLASTIKOS 

The Philogelos or 'Love of Laughter', once attributed to Philagrius of 
Alexandria and the fifth century ad, is a collection of much older Greek 
witticisms. It features the original scholastikos or 'absent-minded professor', 
together with the men of Abdera and Cumae, butts of early forms of the Irish 
(or Polish) joke. 

• A scholastikos who wanted to see what he looked like when asleep stood in 

front of a mirror with his eyes shut. 

• A scholastikos met a friend and said, 'I heard you'd died.' 'But you see I'm 

alive.' 'Yes, but the man who told me was much more reliable than you.' 

• A Cumaean went to the embalmer's to collect the body of his dead father. 
The embalmer, looking for the right corpse, asked if it had any distinctive 
features. 'Abad cough.' 

• A Cumaean was selling honey. A passer-by tasted it, and found it excellent. 

'Yes,' said the Cumaean, 'I wouldn't be selling it at all if a mouse hadn't 
fallen into it.' 

• A Scottish scholastikos decided to economize by training his donkey not to 

eat, so he gave it no food. When the animal had starved to death, the 
owner complained, 'And just when it was learning to live without 
eating.' 1 

Collectors of folk-tales have recorded versions of the last story in Estonian, 
Latvian, Lithuanian, Swedish, English, Spanish, Catalan, Walloon, German, 
Italian, Slovene, Serbo-Croat, Russian, and Greek. Malcolm Bradbury uses it 
in Rates of Exchange, as part of the heritage of his imaginary East European 
country, 'Slaka'. 2 





Hippocrates of Cos (c.460-357) took medicine out of the realm of religion 
and magic. Numerous treatises on public health, hygiene, patient care, and 
surgery were attributed to him. The Hippocratic Oath, whereby doctors 
dedicated their lives to the welfare of their patients, remained the corner-stone of 
medical practice until quite recently. His book of aphorisms begins with the line: 
'Life is short, Art is long.' [hysteria] 

Eudoxus of Cnidus (fl. c.350) taught the motions of the planets round the 
sun, whilst inventing the sundial. Aristotle wrote systematic works in both 
physics and biology. His classification of animal species forms the basis of all 
subsequent zoology. His Politics begins with the inimitable remark: 'Man is 
above all a political animal.' Aristotle's pupil, Theophrastus of Lesbos (c.370- 
288), applied the same methods of classification to botany. His treatise on 
Characters can be seen as the founding text of analytical psychology. 

From the historian's point of view, Heraclitus was probably the most 
important of these pioneers. Heraclitus reasoned that everything in the world is 
subject to perpetual change and decay: also that change is caused by the 
inevitable clash of opposites-in other words, by dialectics. In so doing he 
unwrapped the two basic ideas of the historian's trade: change over time, and 
causation. His favourite aphorism was: 'You cannot step into the same river 
twice.' [ELEKTRON] 

Greek mathematics developed under the influence both of speculative thought 
and of religious mysticism. Thales had supposedly learned the rudiments of 
arithmetic and geometry in Egypt. But it was Pythagoras of Samos (c.572-497) 
who, in addition to compiling the results of his predecessors, made a number of 
original advances. He launched the Theory of Numbers, formulated the theorem 
about the square of the hypotenuse of the right-angle triangle, and, most 
interestingly, worked out the mathematical basis of musical harmony. He may be 
the author of the beautiful but mistaken theory of 'the music of the spheres'. 
Eudoxus discovered the Theory of Proportions, and the method of exhaustion for 
measuring curvilinear surfaces. His disciple, Menaechmus, discovered conic 
sections. 

All these researches prepared the way for Euclides of Alexandria (fl. c.300), 
whose Elements is said to have reigned supreme for longer than any book save 
the Bible. Euclid was the great mathematical systematizer, who set out to 
provide lasting proofs for all existing knowledge. When asked by the ruler of 



Egypt whether geometry could not be made more simple, he replied that there 
was 'no royal road'. The next generation was dominated by Archimedes and by 
Eratosthenes of Cyrene (276-196), who, in calculating the earth's diameter at 
252,000 stades or 7,850 miles, erred by less than 1 per cent. Lastly there was 
Apollonius of Perge ( fl. c .220 bc), who wrote a vast eight-volume study of 
Conies and found an approximation for pi that was even closer than that of 
Archimedes. [Archimedes] 

Greek moral philosophy, divided in the later centuries into several rival schools, 
greatly modified the teachings of traditional religion. The Sceptics, founded by 
Pyrrho of Elis, whose dates are not known, asserted that it is not possible to 
attain certain knowledge about anything, and hence that man's sole object should 
be the pursuit of virtue. He was an anti-speculative speculator, who exerted an 
important influence on the Athenian Academy after Plato's death. 


HYSTERIA 

According to various Hippocratic treatises on medicine, hysteria was 
exclusively a woman's disease associated with uterine disorders. Hystera in 
Greek meant 'womb'; and the state of nervous agitation was caused when 
menstrual blood was unable to escape: 

Whenever the menses are suppressed or cannot find a way out, illness 
results. This happens if the mouth of the womb is closed or if some part of 
[the] vagina is prolapsed ... Whenever two months' menses are accumulated 
in the womb, they move off into the lungs where they are prevented from 
exiting. 1 

In another variant, the womb itself was thought to become displaced and 
to wander round the body cavity. By pressing on the heart or brain, it 
provoked anxiety and eventually uncontrollable panic. Religious taboos 
forbade human dissection; and the internal workings of women's (and of 
men's) bodies were not understood until modern times. In the view of one 
analyst, however, ancient attitudes to women survived even when ancient 
anatomical theories had been discounted. 'The notion persisted that women's 




minds could be adversely affected by their reproductive tracts.' 2 

The history of women's bodies is a complicated subject. Over the ages, their 
size, weight, shape, muscular development, menstruation, child-bearing 
capacity, maturing, ageing, and disease patterns have varied considerably, as 
have their symbolism, their religious connotation, their aesthetic 
appreciation, their decoration, clothing, and display. Women's awareness of 
their physical potential has been particularly constrained. So much so that a 
standard textbook on the subject can seriously ask: 'Could any woman enjoy 
sex before 1900?' 3 Histories of the male body do not ask such things. 

As for the wonderful workings of the womb, modern research suggests 
that the interdependence of the female nervous and reproductive systems is 
extremely sophisticated. A survey of women's health conducted during the 
prolonged Siege of Budapest in 1944-5, for example, revealed unusually 
high levels of amenorrhea. Menstruation was suspended through well- 
grounded anxieties, not through hysteria. The womb does not need to be told 
that a minimal birthrate makes very good sense in times of maximum 
danger. 


ELEKTRON 

Elektron, 'bright stone', was the ancient Greek name for amber. The 
Greeks knew that, when rubbed, it generated a force which attracted other 
objects, such as feathers. Thales of Miletus said it had 'psyche'. Electra, 'the 
Bright One', was the name given to two women prominent in Greek myth. 
One, the daughter of Atlas, was a favourite paramour of Zeus. The other, 
daughter of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra and sister to Orestes, figures in 
the tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides. 

The invisible physical force which repels and attracts had no name until 
William Gilbert, the 'father of magnetism', called it 'electric' in his treatise 
De Magnete (1600). 'Earth', he wrote, 'is nothing but a large magnet.' 

Advances in the study of electricity and magnetism were made by A. M. 




Ampere, H. C. Oersted, and Michael Faraday, until J. C. Maxwell (1831-79) 
combined the two into the theory of electromagnetic force. H. R. Hertz 
(1857-94) demonstrated the existence of electromagnetic waves filling a 
spectrum of different frequencies. Application of electricity had moved on 
from the dynamo and the electric motor to radio and X-rays. Finally, in 
1891, the British physicist J. D. Stoney needed a label for the negatively 
charged particles which constitute the smallest component of matter and 
which, in the company of positively charged protons and non-charged 
neutrons, orbit round the nucleus of an atom on the scale of a pinhead in St 
Peter's dome. He called them electrons. 1 (See Appendix III, p. 1272.) 


The Cynics were founded by Diogenes of Sinope (c.412-323), who held a 
Tolstoyan sort of belief in the value of freeing oneself from desire. Their name 
meant literally 'the dogs'. Diogenes was a noted eccentric, who lived in a barrel 
as a gesture of renouncing the world's comforts, and walked the streets of 
daytime Athens with a lantern, 'looking for honest men'. In a meeting with 
Alexander the Great in Corinth, he is said to have told the King to 'stop blocking 
my sunshine'. 

The Epicureans, named after Epicurus of Samos (342-270), taught that 
people should devote themselves to the pursuit of happiness, fearing neither 
death nor the gods. (It is a thought which found its way into the constitution of 
the USA.) They gained an undeserved reputation for mere pleasure-seeking; in 
reality, they held that the road to happiness lay through self-control, calm, and 
self-denial. 

The Stoics, founded by Zenon of Cyprus (335-263), took their name from 
the Athenian Stoa poikile or 'painted porch', where the group first gathered. 
They followed the conviction that human passions should be governed by reason 
and (like the Sceptics) that the pursuit of virtue was all. Their vision of a 
universal brotherhood of mankind, their sense of duty, and their disciplined 
training, designed to insure them against pain and suffering, proved specially 
attractive to the Romans, [athletes] 


ARCHIMEDES 





Archimedes of Syracuse (287-212 BC) was the mathematicians' 
mathematician. He possessed a childlike delight in solving problems for 
their own sake. Not that he was averse to practical matters. After studying in 
Alexandria, he returned to Sicily as adviser to King Hiero II. There he 
invented the 'Screw' for raising water; he built a planetarium, later carried 
off to Rome; and he designed the catapults and grapnels which held off the 
final Roman siege of Syracuse (see pp. 143-4). He launched the science of 
hydrostatics, and is best known for running naked into the street, shouting 
Heureka, heureka ('I've found it'), after supposedly working out the 
'Archimedes Principle' in his bath. The Principle states that an object 
immersed in water apparently loses weight equal to the weight of the water 
displaced. The volume of the object can then be easily calculated. On the 
subject of levers, he said: 'Give me a place to stand, and I will move the 
earth.' 

His greatest enthusiasm, however, was reserved for purely speculative 
problems: 

1. The Sand-reckoner. Archimedes set himself the task of calculating 
how many grains of sand would be needed to fill the universe. To deal with 
the vast numbers involved, and since decimals were not yet in existence, he 
came up with the original concept of 'a myriad myriad', i.e. 10,000 x 10,000 
or 10,000 2 . Given that he assumed the universe to be equivalent to the 
galaxy of the sun, his answer of 10,000 37 was entirely respectable. 

2. Measuring the Circle. Archimedes worked out the ratio of the 
circumference to the diameter by starting from the upper and lower limits of 
the perimeter of a 96-sided polygon. He took certain known approximations, 
and went on to find approximations for the square roots of the necessary 
seven-digit numbers. He had to work, of course, in the clumsy alphabetic 
system of numeration. But his answer for what is now called pi (n) lay 
between the limits of 3 l/7(= 3.1428571) and 3 10/71 (3.140845). (The 
accepted modern value is 3.14159265.) 

3. Problema Bovinum. Archimedes thought up a seemingly 
straightforward teaser about the God Apollo having a herd of cattle, bulls 
and cows together, some black, some brown, some white, some spotted. 
Among the bulls, the number of white ones was half plus one-third of the 
number of the black ones, greater than the brown ... etc., etc. Among the 



cows, the number of white ones was one-third plus one-quarter the number 
of the total black cattle ... etc., etc. What was the composition of the herd? 
The answer comes to a total of more than 79 billion, which is far in excess of 
the number of beasts that could possibly find standing-room on the island of 
Sicily. (Sicily's 25,000 km 2 can only accommodate 12.75 billion cattle at 2 
m 2 per head, not excepting those which would have to stand in the boiling 
crater of Mount Etna.) 1 


Greek sexuality is a subject for which fashionable scholarship would prefer 
monographs to paragraphs. What for scholars of an older vintage was 'unnatural 
vice' has now been upgraded to personal 'orientation' or 'preference'; and 
homosexuality is widely considered to occupy a central position in an ancient 
code of social manners which, as now presented, has very modern overtones. 
'The Greek vice' did not generate guilt: for a man to pursue young boys was no 
more reprehensible than to pursue young girls. Young Greek males, like English 
public schoolboys, had presumably to take sodomy in their stride. Parents sought 
to protect their sons in the same ways that they protected their daughters. Female 
homosexuality was in evidence alongside its male counterpart, though the island 
of Lesbos, home of the poetess Sappho and her circle, did not lend its name to 
the phenomenon in ancient times. Incest, too, was clearly an issue. The tragic 
fate of the legendary Oedipus, who killed his father and married his mother by 
mistake, was proof of divine wrath. Generally speaking, the Greeks do not 
appear either licentious or puritanical so much as practical and open-minded. 
Their world was full of explicit erotica, about which they were sublimely 
unembarrassed.- 

One must not imagine, however, that Greek assumptions about sexuality 
resembled those of contemporary California. A slave-owning society, for 
example, assumed that the bodies of the unfree were available for the uses and 
abuses of the free. Sexual activity thus became a function of social status. 
Mutuality in sexual relations did not have to be taken into account, still less 
shared feelings. Satisfaction was mainly associated with the phallic pleasure of 
the active male who imposed himself and his organ on its passive recipients. 
Despite legal constraints men of superior status often took it for granted that they 
could penetrate their inferiors at will; and inferiors included women, boys, 
servants, and foreigners. This assumption, if correctly identified, would render 





the modern distinction between homo- and heterosexuality largely irrelevant. 
Similarly, the distinction between pederast and philerast was less dependent on 
personal proclivities than on the age at which the growing male could assert 
himself.- 

The classic text for the study of such matters-Aristophanes' myth in Plato's 
Symposium -mentions a number of sexual practices that appear to foreshadow 
familiar modern categories. Yet closer inspection suggests that the Greeks may 
have followed a system of values that are very alien to our own. According to 
the myth, human beings were originally eight-limbed, two-faced creatures, each 
with two sets of genitals front and back. They came in three varieties-male, 
female, and androgynous. Zeus later cut them in half, and invented sexual 
intercourse for the benefit of the separated halves. People possessed assorted 
sexual desires in line with the type of ancestor from whom they were descended. 
Hence the binary opposition of male and female would seem to have been 
lacking; and pluralist sexuality, present to different degrees in all individuals, 
may have been considered the basic condition. Unfortunately, modern scholarly 
opinion presents no less pluralism than the subject in hand.- 


ATHLETES 

Athletic games were an essential part of Greek life. Every self-respecting 
city had its stadium. The pan-hellenic games at Olympia were but the most 
prestigious of more than a hundred such festivals. 1 The common devotion to 
athletics, and to the gods, whose patronage the games celebrated, gave a 
strong sense of cultural unity to a politically divided country. The athletes, 
all male, competed in ten well-established disciplines. From the seventh 
century onwards, when one competitor accidentally lost his shorts, they 
customarily performed naked. They were not amateurs, being accustomed to 
arduous training and expecting handsome rewards. The tariff of prizes (in 
denarii) awarded at a minor festival at Aphrodisias in the first century 
indicates the status of particular events: 

long-distance race: 750; pentathlon: 500; race in armour: 500; sprint 
(1 stade): 1,250; pankration: 3,000; wrestling: 2,000; foot race (2 





stades): 1,000; boxing: 2,000. 

The standard stade, or stadium length, was about 212 metres. Runners 
turned round a post at the end opposite the start. The pentathlon consisted of 
five events: long jump, discus, javelin, foot race, wrestling. In the 
pankradon, a form of all-in combat, one aimed as in judo to force one's 
opponent into submission. Quoit-throwing and chariot-racing were also 
important. 2 

Athletes and their home cities gained great renown from their triumphs 
at the Olympiads. Sparta was prominent. Athens during its golden age 
gained only four victories out of a possible 183. But the most successful 
district was Elis in the Peloponnese, home of the first recorded victor, 
Coroebus, in 77 6 bc, and site of Olympia itself. 

The all-time champion athlete was Milo of Croton, who won the prize 
for wrestling in five successive Olympiads between 536 and 520 BC. On the 
last occasion he carried the sacrificial ox round the stadium on his shoulders, 
before sitting down to eat it. [spice-ox] 

Most of Pindar's surviving odes are devoted to the games: 

Single is the race, single 
Of men and of gods; 

From a single mother we both draw breath. 

But a difference of power in everything 
Keeps us apart. 

For the one thing is Nothing, but the brazen sky 
Stays a fixed habitation for ever. 

Yet we can in greatness of mind 
Or of body be like the Immortals, 

Though we know not to what goal 

By day or in the nights 

Fate has written that we shall run. 3 

The ethos of the games lasted well into Christian times. St Paul was surely a 
fan, if not a competitor. 'I have fought a good fight,' he wrote. T have run 
the course. I have kept the faith.' 4 The sentiment was quintessentially Greek. 

The last ancient games at Olympia took place either in ad 389 or 393. 
The last known victor ludorum, in 385, was an Armenian. There is no 



evidence that the Emperor Theodosius I formally banned the festival. More 
probably, since Christian opinion had turned against pagan cults of all sorts, 
it was impossible to revive it after the Visigoths' invasion of Greece in 395. 
Substitute games continued at Antioch in Asia until 530. 5 

The Olympics were revived at Athens on 6-12 April 1896, after an interval 
of more than 1,500 years. The initiator and founding president of the 
International Olympic Committee was the French sportsman Baron Pierre de 
Coubertin (1863-1937). With the exception of wartime, the games have 
been held at four-year intervals and at various venues throughout the 
twentieth century. Women were permitted to compete from 1912. The 
Winter Olympics were organized as from the 1924 meeting in Chamonix. 
Appropriately enough, the winner of the first marathon race of the modern 
series in 1896, Louis Spyridon, was a Greek. 


Greek social structures do not present a simple picture. There were fundamental 
differences between the societies of the city-states and those of the remoter 
mountain areas, such as Arcadia in the Peloponnese, where pastoral, pre-Greek 
tribes survived into Roman times. Slavery was a general feature, though it did 
not necessarily form the foundation of all social and economic institutions, as 
some historians would like to believe. (In the Tive-stage scheme' of Marxism- 
Leninism, classical slave-holding is taken as the necessary starting-point of all 
social history.) In Athens, the population was divided between slaves, metics or 
'resident foreigners', and citizens. The slaves, who were called andrapoda, 
literally 'human feet', were treated as chattels, and could be killed with impunity. 
They were not allowed to serve in the army. Freed slaves automatically rose to 
the status of metics, who could be both taxed and conscripted. The citizens (who 
alone could call themselves 'Athenians') had the right to landed property and the 
duty of military service. They were divided into ten phylai or tribes, and the 
tribes into smaller groupings called trittyes (thirds) and demes or parishes. Each 
of these bodies had its own corporate life, with a role in both civil and military 
organization. 


Greek political organization was characterized by variety and experimentation. 
Since every polis or city-state governed itself, at least in theory, a wide range of 




political traditions developed, each with its variants, derivatives, and imitations. 
There were monarchies, like Samos under the pirate-king Polycrates. There were 
despotisms, especially among the cities of Asia Minor influenced by the Persian 
example. There were oligarchies of various types like Corinth, Sparta, or 
Massilia. There were democracies, like Athens in its prime. Yet incessant wars, 
leagues, and confederations caused constant interaction; and each of the different 
polities was subject to drastic evolutions. 

The Athenian system itself underwent many changes, from its earliest known 
manifestations in the seventh century under Draco, author of the first 'draconian 5 
law-code, and the sixth-century reforms of Solon and the benevolent despotism 
of Pisistratus. Two hundred years after Draco, Athens's defeat in the 
Peloponnesian War ushered in the episode of the 'Thirty Tyrants' and the rule of 
the radical Cleon, Pericles's chief critic. Even in the central decades of Athenian 
democracy in the fifth century, modern scholarship is far from unanimous about 
the true extent of participation by the citizens. Elaborate controversies take place 
over the size of the slave population, the role of the city mob, the degree of land- 
holding among the citizens, the place of the citizen-peasant, and, above all, the 
operations of various city assemblies-the Boule or 'Council of 500', the 
Ecclesia, which was the main legislative assembly, and the jury courts. It turns 
out that the demos or 'people', which is thought to have consisted of up to 
50,000 exclusively male freemen, is no easier to define than the democracy. Nor 
is it easy to reconcile the fact that Pericles or Demosthenes, the great Athenian 
democrats, were (like Washington and Jefferson) slave-owners, or that the 
democratic Athens exercised a tyrannical hold over the city's lesser 
dependencies, [demos] 

Not surprisingly, the extreme complications of Greek political practice 
offered fertile ground for the growth of political theory. Plato's Republic, which 
advocates the rule of the Guardians-a somewhat totalitarian breed of so-called 
philosopher-kings-and Aristotle's Polidcs, with its categoric statement about 
man being zoon polidkon, offer two opposing approaches to the subject. The 
basic political vocabulary of the modern world, from 'anarchy' to 'politics' itself, 
is largely a Greek invention. 

Greek history-writing, like the theatre, had its triad of giants. Herodotus of 
Halicarnassus (484-420) is commonly known as the 'Father of History', but his 
keen interest in foreign lands earned from his more chauvinistic compatriots the 



label of 'Father of Lies'. He wrote from eyewitness reports and from personal 
observation on his far-flung travels. He saw the past in terms of the titanic 
contest between Europe and Asia, and his nine books culminate in the Graeco- 
Persian wars. Thucydides (455-C.401 bc) the Athenian, in the opinion of 
Thomas Hobbes and many others, was quite simply 'the most Politick 
Historiographer that ever writ'. He introduced the systematic analysis of 
causation and consequence; he quoted documents and treatises at length; and in 
the set-piece orations of his principal protagonists he found a marvellous method 
for injecting his strictly impartial narrative with subjective opinion. His eight 
books on the Peloponnesian War were 'not designed', he wrote, 'to meet the 
taste of an immediate public, but to last for ever'. Xenophon (c.428-354), 
another Athenian, was author of the Hellenica and of Anabasis. The Hellenica 
continues the narrative of Greek history from the point where Thucydides had 
broken off (in 411), just as Thucydides had to some extent carried on from 
Herodotus. The Anabasis, translated as 'The Persian Expedition', describes the 
long march of 10,000 Greek mercenaries, including Xenophon himself, who 
went to Mesopotamia and back in the service of a Persian pretender. The shout 
of Thalassa! Thalassa !-'The sea! The sea!'-when, after months of marching, 
Xenophon's companions caught sight of the coast from the hills behind 
Trebizond, provides one of the most enthusiastic moments of military chronicles. 


DEMOS 

Some people believe that in 507 bc a lasting tradition of popular 
sovereignty was launched by Cleisthenes the Alcmaeonid. In ad 1993 they 
were moved to celebrate 'the 2,500th anniversary of the birth of democracy'. 
To this end, a lavish banquet in London's Guildhall was addressed by the 
President of the Classical Society. 1 In fact, the seeds of Athenian democracy 
had been sown some time before Cleisthenes. The Assembly of Citizens, the 
Ecclesia, which met in the meeting-ground of the Pnyx alongside the 
Acropolis, was established by Solon. But it was easily manipulated by 
aristocratic leaders such as Pisistratus and his sons, who used it to bolster 
their fifty-year tyranny from 560 to 510 BC. 

Cleisthenes belonged to a rich family which tried to share power with 




Pisistratus, then chose exile. He was probably responsible for refacing the 
Temple of Zeus at Delphi with Parian marble to atone for a massacre 
committed by his kin. He led an abortive invasion of Attica in 513, possibly 
seeking Persian aid. But it was the Spartans not Cleisthenes who drove out 
the last of the Pisistratids three years later. 

Cleisthenes is said to have invoked the power of the people in order to 
undermine the old tribal organizations on which his predecessors had relied. 
By proposing sovereign power for the Ecclesia, he gained the authority to 
instigate still wider reforms. He replaced the four old tribes with ten new 
ones, each with its own shrine and hero-cult. He greatly strengthened the 
demes or 'parishes' into which the tribes were divided, and extended the 
franchise to all freemen resident on Athenian territory. Above all, he 
instituted the Boule, which functioned as a steering committee for the 
Assembly's agenda. He also initiated legal ostracism. He has been called 
'the founder of the art of organizing public opinion'. 

Athenian democracy, which lasted for 185 years, was far from perfect. 
The sovereignty of the people was limited by the machinations of the Boule, 
by the waywardness of the deme, and by the continuing influence of wealthy 
patrons and demagogues. To ensure a quorum of 6,000 at meetings of the 
Ecclesia, the citizens were literally 'roped in' from the streets, with a rope 
dipped in red paint. The extent of participation, both in the central and the 
district bodies, is a matter of intense scholarly debate. 2 And yet the citizens 
really did rule. They enjoyed equality before the law. They elected the ten 
top officials, including the Strategos or military commander. They drew lots 
for distributing hundreds of annual administrative posts among themselves. 
Most importantly, they held public servants to account. Dishonest or 
bungling officials could be dismissed, or even executed. 

Not everyone was impressed. Plato thought that democracy meant the 
rule of the incompetent. Aristophanes made fun of 'that angry, waspish, 
intractable old man, Demos of Pnyx'. At one point he asked, 'So what's the 
solution?' and replied, 'Women'. 

Unfortunately, the link between the democracy of ancient Athens and that of 
contemporary Europe is tenuous. Democracy did not prevail in its birthplace. 
It was not admired by Roman thinkers; and it was all but forgotten for more 
than a millennium. The democratic practices of today's Europe trace their 



origins as much to popular assemblies of the Viking type [ding], to the diets 
convened by feudal monarchs, and to medieval city republics. The Athenian 
notion of a sovereign assembly consisting of all qualified citizens found its 
counterparts in medieval Novgorod, Hungary, and Poland-in political 
systems which spawned no heirs. The theorists of the Enlightenment blended 
classical knowledge with an interest in constitutional reform; and a 
romanticized vision of ancient Athens played a part in this among classically 
educated liberals. But liberals could themselves be critical. De Tocqueville 
inveighed against 'the tyranny of the majority'. Edmund Burke called 
democracy on the French model 'the most shameless thing in the world'. 
Democracy has rarely been the norm. 

Nowadays there is little consensus about the essence of democracy. In 
theory, it promotes all the virtues, from freedom, justice, and equality to the 
rule of law, the respect for human rights, and the promotion of political 
pluralism and of civil society. In practice, 'rule by the people' is impossible. 
There is much to divide the Continental brand of popular sovereignty from 
the British brand of parliamentary sovereignty (see p. 631). And all brands 
have their faults. Winston Churchill once said that 'democracy is the worst 
of political systems, except for all the others'. What does exist, as always, is 
almost universal abhorrence of tyranny. And this is what propels all newly 
liberated nations in the direction of democracy, irrespective of previous 
realities. 'Our whole history inclines us towards the democratic Powers', 
declared the President of newborn Czechoslovakia in 1918. 3 In 1989-91, 
similar sentiments were echoed by leaders of all the countries of the ex- 
Soviet bloc. 

This is not to deny that democracy, like any other movement, needs its 
founding myth. It needs an ancient pedigree and worthy heroes. And who 
could be more ancient or more worthy than Cleisthenes the Alcmaeonid? 


By common assent, the zenith of Greek civilization was reached during the Age 
of Pericles in Athens. In the interval between the city's salvation from the 
Persian invasion in 480 bc and the onset of the ruinous war with Sparta in 431, 
the political, intellectual, and cultural energies of Athens peaked. Pericles 
(c.495-429), general and statesman, was leader of the moderate democratic 
faction. He had organized the reconstruction of the pillaged Acropolis, and was 




the friend of artists and philosophers. His funeral oration for the dead of the first 
year of the Peloponnesian War pulses with pride at the freedom and high culture 
of his native city: 


Our love of what is beautiful does not lead to extravagance; our love of the things of the mind does not 
make us soft. We regard wealth as something to be properly used, rather than as something to boast 
about....Here each individual is interested not only in his own affairs, but in the affairs of the state as 
well.... We do not say that a man who takes no interest in politics is a man who minds his own business; we 
say that he has no business here at all....Others are brave out of ignorance, and, when they begin to think, 
they begin to fear. But the man who can most truly be accounted brave is he who best knows the meaning of 
what is sweet in life and what is terrible, and then goes out undeterred to meet what is to come.- 

The Athenian contemporaries of Pericles gave him good reason to be proud. 
Anaxagoras and Socrates, Euripides and Aeschylus, Pindar and Pheidias, 
Antiphon and Aristophanes, Democritus and Hippocrates, Herodotus and 
Thucydides, all walked the same streets, all watched the Parthenon taking shape 
for its inauguration in 438. Athens, The eye of Greece, Mother of arts and 
eloquence', had fulfilled the prediction of the Oracle: 'You will become an eagle 
among the clouds for all time'. Most appropriate perhaps are the words from a 
fragment of Pindar: 

At r" Xinapai kcli toar€<f>avoi *al aotSiptot, 

"EXXaSos fpeiapa, kX( ival ABavai, Satptovtov npoXUBpov. 


(Shining and violet-crowned and celebrated in song, bulwark of Greece, famous 
Athens, divine city.)- 

Sparta, otherwise known as Lacedaemon, was Athens's foil and rival. To 
modern sensibilities it was as ugly as Athens is attractive. Exceptionally, it was a 
landlocked city, built on the plain of Laconia in the middle of the Peleponnese. It 
possessed no native navy, and was entirely devoted to the militarism which had 
enabled it to confront all its immediate neighbours-the Messenians, the 
Argives, and the Arcadians. Its system of government, bestowed in remote times 
by the divine Lycurgus, was variously described as a despotic form of oligarchy 
or an oligarchic form of despotism. A council of ephors or magistrates wielded 
dictatorial powers. They gave orders to the two hereditary 'kings' of Sparta, who 
acted as high priests and military commanders. Sparta had few colonies, and 
solved its problems of overpopulation by culling its male infants. Weaklings 


were ceremonially left to die in the open. All surviving boys were taken by the 
state at the age of seven to be trained in physical prowess and military discipline. 
At twenty, they started their forty-year service as citizen-soldiers. They were 
forbidden to undertake trade or crafts, and were supported by the toil of an 
underclass of helots or slaves. The result was a culture which had little time for 
the arts and graces, and little sense of solidarity with the rest of Hellas. 
According to Aristotle, it was also a society in which the number of men began 
to fall alarmingly, and a large part of the land was held by women. To be 
'laconic' was to spurn fine words. When Philip of Macedon sent a threatening 
letter to Sparta: 'if I enter Lacedaemon, I shall raze it', the ephors sent him a 
one-word reply, an, 'if', [makedon] 

The era of hellenism-that is, the era when the world of the Greek city-states 
was merged into the wider but essentially non-Greek world created by Alexander 
and his successors-is frequently despised for its decadence. Certainly, in the 
political sphere, the internecine strife of the dynasties that latched onto 
Alexander's dismembered empire does not make an edifying story. On the other 
hand, Greek culture had stamina, and the beneficial effects of a common 
tradition, through several centuries and in diverse lands, should not be casually 
dismissed. Greek rulers in the Indus Valley, where the veneer of hellenism was 
thinnest, held on into the middle of the first century bc. In Macedonia the 
Antigonid dynasty, founded by Alexander's one-eyed general, Antigonus (382- 
301), reigned until their defeat by the Romans in 168. In Syria, and for a time in 
Persia and in Asia Minor, the Seleucid dynasty, founded by Seleucus I Nicator 
(ruled 280-261), controlled vast if ever-diminishing Asiatic territories. They 
were active hellenizers, consciously executing Alexander's plans for a network 
of new Greek colonies in Asia. They surrendered to Rome in 69. The eastern 
half of the Seleucid realm was seized in 250 bc by Arsaces, the Parthian (d. 
248), whose Arsacid dynasty ruled in Persia for nearly 500 years, until the 
rebirth of a native Persian empire in ad 226. In Egypt the Ptolemaic dynasty 
launched by Alexander's bastard half-brother, Ptolemaeus Soter, 'the Preserver' 
(d. 285), reigned until 31 bc. 


MAKEDON 




To ask whether Macedonia is Greek is rather like asking whether Prussia 
was German. If one talks of distant origins, the answer in both cases must be 
'No'. Ancient Macedonia started its career in the orbit of Illyrian or Thracian 
civilization. But, as shown by excavation of the royal tombs, it was subject 
to a high degree of hellenization before Philip of Macedon conquered 
Greece. 1 [papyrus] 

The Roman province of Macedonia stretched to the Adriatic [egnatia], 
and from the sixth century onwards was heavily settled by migrant Slavs. 
According to one theory, the Slavs mingled with the residue of the pre-Greek 
population to form a new, non-Greek Macedonian nation. The Byzantine 
empire was sometimes dubbed 'Macedonia' because of its Greek 
connections. But the former province of Macedonia, and much of the 
Peloponnese, was submerged in 'Sclavonia'. 

In medieval times Macedonia was incorporated for a time into the 
Bulgarian empire, and remained permanently within the exarchate of the 
Bulgarian Orthodox Church. This strengthened later Bulgarian claims. In the 
fourteenth century it passed under Serbian rule. In 1346 Stefan Dusan was 
crowned in Skopje 'Tsar of the Serbs, Greeks, Bulgars and Albanians'. This 
was to strengthen Serbian claims. Then came the Ottomans. 

In the late nineteenth century, Ottoman Macedonia was a typical Balkan 
province of mixed religious and ethnic composition. Orthodox Christians 
lived alongside Muslims, and Greeks and Slavs alongside Albanians and 
Turks. By custom, all Orthodox Christians were counted as 'Greeks' because 
of their allegiance to the Patriarch of Constantinople. 

Throughout the Balkan wars (see p. 874) Macedonia was fought over by 
Greece, Bulgaria, and Serbia. It was divided into three parts. (See Appendix 
III, p. 1309.) Southern Macedonia, centred on Thessaloniki, was taken over 
by Greece. After the Graeco-Turkish population exchange of 1922, and the 
Slav exodus due to the Civil War in 1949, it came to be dominated by a 
strong majority of highly patriotic Greeks, 'Alexander's successors', many 
of them immigrants from Turkey. Eastern Macedonia found itself in 
Bulgaria, which treated it as synonymous with 'Western Bulgaria'. Northern 
Macedonia, centred on Skopje and the upper Vardar valley, possessed a 
mixed Albanian and Slav population living within Serbia. 

When this northern section was reconstituted in 1945 as the autonomous 



republic of 'Makedonija' within Yugoslavia, a determined campaign was 
launched to simplify history and to transmute the identity of the entire 
population. The Yugoslav leadership was intent on reversing the effects of 
wartime Bulgarian occupation, and on resisting the cultural charms of 
ancient Greece. The Slav dialect of the political elite was declared to be a 
separate language; Old Church Slavonic was equated with 'Old 
Macedonian'; and a whole generation was educated according to the 'Great 
Idea' of a Slav Macedonia stretching back for centuries. 2 

Not surprisingly, when the government of Skopje declared independence 
in 1992, no one could agree what their republic should be called. A Greek 
scholar was reported to have received death threats for revealing the 
existence of a Slavic-speaking minority on the Greek side of Greece's closed 
northern frontier. 3 Neutral commentators abroad adopted the evocative 
acronym of FYROM-'Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.' Equally 
useful was the curious mnemonic of FOPITGROBBSOSY-'Former 
Province of Illyria, Thrace, Greece, Rome, Byzantium, Bulgaria, Serbia, the 
Ottoman Empire, Serbia, and Yugoslavia.' 


The Ptolemies were noted for their love and patronage of the arts and 
learning, even when, occasionally, as with Ptolemy VII Physcon ('The Paunch'), 
they were also noted for the most disgusting perversions. Through a series of 
matrimonial contortions, Physcon contrived to marry his sister, who was also his 
brother's widow (and who thereby became simultaneously sister, wife, and 
sister-in-law); to divorce her in favour of her daughter by a previous marriage 
(who thereby became simultaneously his second wife, niece and stepdaughter); 
and to murder his son (who was also a nephew). Incest, to protect the purity of 
royal blood, was a tradition of the Pharaohs which other cultures have called 
decadence. 

Yet Therme (Thessalonika), Antioch, Pergamum, Palmyra, and above all 
Alexandria of Egypt became major cultural, economic, and political centres. The 
blending of Greek and oriental influences, which fermented alongside the 
decadent dynasties, created that inimitable hellenistic culture which eventually 
triumphed over its Western, Latin masters. After all, the 'Romans' of Byzantium, 
who upheld the Roman Empire for a thousand years beyond the fall of Rome, 
were heirs to the hellenistic Greeks, and in a very real sense the last successors 




of Alexander. In the words of Horace, Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit, 
'Captured Greece captured its fierce conqueror'. 

Hellenistic culture, therefore, acquired a much broader base than did its 
hellenic progenitor. According to Isocrates (436-338), the last of the Attic 
Orators, 'Athens has brought it to pass that the name of Greek should no longer 
be thought of as a matter of race, but a matter of intelligence'. As a result, the 
quantity of Greek writers actually increased. There was a gang of geographers, 
from Strabo (c.63 bc to ad 21) to Pausanias ( fl. c. ad 150). There was a 
profusion of poets: Apollonius, Aratus, and Bion, author of The Lament for 
Adonis; Hermesaniax; Moschus, Meleager, and Musaeus; Oppian, Timon, and 
Theocritus. There was a host of historians: Manetho of Egypt, inventor of the 
chronological system of kingdoms and dynasties, and Berosus (Bar-Osea) of 
Babylon; Polybius of Megalopolis (204-122 bc), the Greek apologist for Rome, 
and Josephus (b. ad 36), Governor of Judaea and author of The Jewish War, 
Appian, Arrian, Herodian, Eusebius. Galenus (129-99) wrote a shelf of medical 
textbooks, Hermogenes (fl c ad 170) the standard treatise on rhetoric. Among 
philosophers the Neostoics, such as Epictetus of Hierapolis (ad 55-135), vied 
with the Neoplatonists: Plotinus (205-70), Porphyry (232-305), Proclus (412- 
88). The Enchiridion or 'Manual' of Stoicism, written by Epictetus, has been 
called the guidebook to the morality of the later classical world. Plutarch (c.46- 
126), the biographer and essayist, Lucian of Samosata (c. 120-80), the satirist 
and the novelists Longus (late 2nd century) and Heliodorus (3rd century) 
exemplify the continuing diversity of the Greek prose tradition under Roman 
rule, [papyrus] 

Among the writers of the hellenistic period, many wrote Greek as their 
second language. Josephus, Lucian, and Marcus Aurelius fit into this category, 
as do the Christian evangelists Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and above all St 
Paul. 

Within the Hellenistic world, Alexandria in Egypt soon gained the 
preeminence that Athens had enjoyed in Greece. Under the rule of the Ptolemies, 
it grew into the largest and most cultured city of the East, second only to Rome 
in wealth and splendour. Its multinational and multilingual population consisted 
of 'Macedonians', Jews, and Egyptians. The decree inscribed on the Rosetta 
Stone, now in the British Museum, provided the trilingual text which permitted 
Champollion to decipher its hieroglyphics. The fabulous Museum or 'College of 
the Muses', with its library of 700,000 volumes, was dedicated to the collection, 



preservation, and study of ancient Greek culture. It was a beacon of learning, 
illuminating the intellectual life of the later classical world as surely as the great 
Pharos illuminated the sea lanes of the harbour. Aristophanes of Byzantium 
(c.257-180 bc), one of the early librarians at Alexandria, was responsible both 
for the first annotated editions of Greek literature and for the first systematic 
analysis of Greek grammar and orthography. Aristarchus of Samothrace (fl. 
c.150 bc) established the text of the Iliad and the Odyssey. Philon or Philo 
Judaeus (30 bc-ad 45), a leader of Alexandria's thriving Jewish community, 
attempted to reconcile Greek philosophy with traditional Judaic theology. Heron, 
an Alexandrian engineer of uncertain date, is reputed to have invented, among 
other things, the steam-engine, the syphon, and a drachma-in-the-slot machine. 

Specially important in the history of cultural transmission were the so-called 
Hermetic Writings. Long attributed to an otherwise unknown author, Hermes 
Trismegistus (the 'thrice greatest Hermes', scribe of the Gods), this huge 
collection of Greek texts from Alexandria purports in effect to be an 
encyclopedia of ancient Egypt. Forty-two sacred books summarize the laws of 
the Pharaohs, their deities, rituals, beliefs, cosmography, astrology, medicine. 
Other books dating from the third century contain a strange mixture of 
Neoplatonic and cabbalistic texts apparently directed against the rise of 
Christianity, [black athena] 

In the long run, however, it is not surprising that Greece's 'shoreline 
civilization' proved unequal to the massed battalions of the neighbouring land- 
based powers. 


PAPYRUS 

In 1963 a carbonized papyrus from the fourth century bc was unearthed at 
Derveni near Thessaloniki in Macedonia. It had either been burned as part of 
a funeral rite or had possibly been used as a firelighter. But it was still 
readable. Deciphered by Dr Faekelmann of Vienna, who separated the layers 
of the reheated roll with static electricity, it was shown to carry a 
commentary on the Orphic poems. It replaced the papyrus of Timotheus' 
Persae (P. Berol. 9875), unearthed at Abusir in Egypt, as the oldest Greek 
papyrological discovery. 1 In 1964 a similar papyrus roll was found in the 




hand of a man buried in the fourth century bc at Callatis on the Black Sea 
coast of Romania. But it crumbled to dust on discovery. 

The Cyperus papyrus plant had been used for writing in Egypt since 
3,000 BC. It was laid out in horizontal and vertical strips, which were then 
pressed flat to form a long volumen or scroll. A thick black ink made from 
soot was applied either by the tip of a sliced reed or by a quill. Papyrus 
continued to be used in Greek and Roman times, especially in lands close to 
the source of supply in the Nile delta. The largest find of classical papyri, 
some 800 in number, was extracted from the lava-sealed ruins of 
Herculaneum. 

Papyrology-the science of papyri-has made an immense contribution 
to classical studies. Since very few other forms of writing have survived 
over two millennia, it has greatly advanced knowledge of ancient 
Palaeography; and it has helped bridge the philological chasm between 
ancient and medieval Greek. It has supplied many texts from the lost 
repertoire of classical literature, including Aristotle's Constitution of Athens, 
Sophocles' Trackers, and Menander's The Discontented Man. It has also 
played a key role in Biblical studies. Some 7,000 early Greek MSS of 
various fragments of the Bible are now extant. The Dead Sea Scrolls 
contained a few Christian as well as Jewish texts. There are two pre- 
Christian papyrus rolls containing segments of Deuteronomy. A papyrus 
from ad 125 carrying the Gospel of St John is significantly older than any 
version on parchment. Some of the oldest papal bulls to survive have done 
so on papyrus. 2 

As papyrus gave way to parchment, to vellum, and eventually to paper, 
so too did the roll give way, to the folded pages of the codex. The passing of 
papyrus, and the advent of the codex, combined to launch the birth of the 
book. [BIBLIA] [XATIVAH] 


BLACK ATHENA 

No thesis has divided the world of classics more profoundly than that 




associated with the title of Black Athena. The traditionalists regard it as 
freakish; others maintain that it deserves close attention. 1 The thesis has two 
separate aspects-one critical, the other propositional. The critical part 
argues with some force that classical studies were moulded by the self- 
centred assumptions of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Europeans, and 
that the cultural debt of Greece and Rome to the older civilizations of the 
Near East was systematically ignored. The critic's purpose, To lessen 
European cultural arrogance', would seem to be fruitful, though talk of The 
Aryan model of Greek civilization' is provocative. 

The main propositions of the thesis centre on the twin notions of Greek 
civilization being specifically rooted in Egypt and of ancient Egyptian 
civilization being 'fundamentally African' and created by 'blacks'. This line 
stands on shakier ground. The Coptic contribution to Greek vocabulary is at 
best marginal. The skin-colour of the Pharaohs, as portrayed on tomb- 
paintings, is usually much fairer than that of their frequently negroid 
servants. Egyptian men were tanned, the women pale. A Nubian dynasty of 
the seventh century bc is the only one out of thirty-one that can realistically 
be categorized as 'black'. Sceptics might suspect that scholarship has been 
hijacked by the racial politics of the USA. 

In which case, it is perhaps necessary to re-state the obvious. If one cares 
to go back far enough, there is no doubt that the origins both of Europeans 
and of European civilization lie far beyond Europe. The point is: how far 
back, and to what starting-point, do prehistorians have to go? [cadmus] 

[CAUCASIA] [DASA] [EPIC] 


Aristotle's simile of mankind living Tike ants milling on the shore' underlines 
the strategic problem of concentrating Greek manpower and resources. The thin, 
extended lines of communication were effective for purposes of economic and 
cultural expansion, but vulnerable to military attack. In the fifth century bc the 
Persian challenge had been repulsed with the greatest difficulty. In the fourth 
century the Macedonians overran the whole of Greece and Persia in the space of 
thirty years. From the third century onwards, the advance of the Roman legions 
was unstoppable. At no time could the Greeks ever put more than 50,000 
hoplites into the field; yet once the Roman Republic was able to conscript the 
manpower of the populous Italian peninsula, it had more than half a million 




soldiers at its disposal. The military contest between Greece and Rome was 
heavily weighted from the start. The Roman conquest of Magna Graecia was 
completed at the end of the Pyrrhic Wars in 266 bc. Sicily was annexed 
following the spirited defence of Syracuse in 212. Macedonia was defeated at 
the Battle of Pydna in 168. Mainland Greece, which under the Achaean League 
had reasserted its independence from Macedonian rule, was subdued by the 
Consul L. Mummius in 146, and turned into the Roman province of Achaia. 

Thereafter, Rome successively reduced all the Greek successor states of the 
former Macedonian empire. The dramatic end occurred in 30 bc, when 
Cleopatra, daughter of Ptolemy XII Auletes and the last Queen of Egypt, 
terminated both a political tradition and her own life by 'pressing the asp to her 
snow-white breast'. As the lover of both Caesar and Antony, she had done her 
utmost to control the relentless advance, and advances, of the Romans. But 
Pascal's bon mot that 'the face of the earth would have been different if 
Cleopatra's nose had been a little shorter' was hardly to the point. The political 
and military strength of the Greek world was exhausted; the absolute supremacy 
of Rome was already an established fact. 

The resultant fusion of the hellenistic and the Roman world, and the 
emergence of the hybrid Graeco-Roman civilization, makes it impossible to put 
a precise date on the death of ancient Greece. But hellenic and hellenistic 
traditions persisted much longer than is usually supposed. The Delphic Oracle 
continued to operate until destroyed by marauding barbarians in ad 267. The 
Olympic Games continued to be held every four years until the 292nd Olympiad 
in ad 392. The Academy continued to teach its pupils in Athens until closed by 
the Christian Emperor Justinian in ad 529. The library of Alexandria, though 
badly burned during Caesar's siege, was not finally closed until the arrival of the 
Muslim Caliphate in ad 641. By then twenty centuries, or two whole millennia, 
had passed since the twilight of Crete and the dawn at Mycenae. 

Much of Greek civilization was lost. Much was absorbed by the Romans, to 
be passed by them into the Christian and the Byzantine traditions. Much had to 
await rediscovery during the Renaissance and after. Yet, one way or another, 
enough has survived for that one small East European country to be regularly 
acclaimed as 'the Mother of Europe', the 'Source of the West', a vital ingredient 
if not the sole fountain-head of Europe. 


Syracuse, Sicily, Year 1 of the 141st Olympiad. In the late summer of the sixth 



year of the Second Punic War, the epic struggle between the Italian city of Rome 
and the African city of Carthage was balanced on the knife-edge of fate. 
Hannibal, the Carthaginian general, having annihilated a number of Roman 
armies sent to halt him, had marched the length of Italy and was campaigning 
strongly in the south. He had just seized the port and fortress of Tarentum (see 
Chapter III, p. 155). The Romans, unable to tame him directly, were straining to 
hold off his allies-the Celts of northern Italy, Philip V of Macedon, who had 
invaded Illyria, and the Greek city of Syracuse. They were specially eager to 
subdue Syracuse, since Syracuse held the key both to Hannibal's supply lines 
from Africa and to their own intentions of re-conquering Sicily. As a result, 
Syracuse was enduring the second season of a determined siege from a Roman 
force under M. Claudius Marcellus. 

Syrakousai, queen of Greater Greece, was the largest, the most prosperous, 
and reputedly the most beautiful of all the Greek colonies in the West. Proudly 
independent in a hellenic age which had seen the subjugation of most city-states, 
it had asserted its supremacy over Athens long since, and had escaped the 
attentions of Alexander the Great. It had overhauled its sometime rival, the 
glorious Acragas, razed by the Carthaginians and never fully restored. In this 
third century bc it had upheld its profitable role astride the overlapping spheres 
of Rome and Carthage. It was the last major representative of unconquered 
Greek civilization. 

Situated on the east coast of Sicily, half-way between the snowy slopes of Mt 
Etna and the island's most southerly point at Cape Pachynum, Syracuse 
commanded a site of unequalled splendour, security, and convenience. It was the 
natural entrepot for trade between the eastern and the western parts of the 
Mediterranean, and the most usual staging-post between Italy and Africa. 
Originally founded on a rocky offshore islet, the Ortygia, it had spread upwards 
onto the neighbouring seaside plateau, which was protected by an almost 
unbroken ring of cliffs and crags. The grand harbour, which curved southwards 
for almost five miles in a perfect bay, was screened by lofty mountains. On the 
other side of the Ortygia, a second harbour could also accommodate the largest 
fleet of ships. [See Map 7, opposite.] 

The island of Ortygia, which served as the city's acropolis, had been joined 
to the mainland by a fortified causeway in the sixth century. Watered by the 
marvellous freshwater spring of Arethusa, it was dominated by a huge Temple of 
Apollo which looked out across the harbour to the matching Temple of Zeus on 



the opposite headland at Olympieum. In the fifth century the entire plateau had 
been enclosed within a mighty length of stone walls which ran atop all the 
natural features. These walls, which stretched for over fifteen miles, were 
anchored to the castle of Euryalos at the foot of the mountains. They surrounded 
half a million citizens living in five distinct suburbs. The Achradina or 'Upper 
City', which possessed its own internal walls, contained the main Agora or 
Forum. Beyond that lay the residential suburbs of Tyche and Epipolae and, 
above them, the monumental buildings of Neapolis, the 'New Town', containing 
a hillside theatre, a nest of temples, and, in Hieron's Altar, the largest sacrificial 
structure of the ancient world. In all this magnificent site there was only one 
blemish. An area of marshland astride the River Anapus, which flowed into the 
Grand Harbour, was a notorious source of summer pestilence. With that one 
proviso, Syracuse basked in unrivalled favours. According to Cicero, who was to 
govern there somewhat later, there was never a day when the sun failed to shine. 
The elevated plateau caught every breeze that blew across the wine-dark waves. 
Flowers bloomed on the cliffs, and still do, even in winter. 

Prior to the arrival of the Roman army, Syracuse could boast more than 500 
years of history. Founded by Corinthian colonists in 734 bc, it was only twenty 
years younger than Rome, and had spread its influence through a network of 
daughter colonies. In 474, only six years after Salamis, it had been responsible 
for the destruction of the naval power of the Etruscans, thereby removing one of 
the early obstacles to Roman fortunes. Tike many city-states, it passed through 
phases of oligarchic, democratic, and monarchical government. It survived its 
supreme test in the successive sieges of 415-413 and 405-404, the former laid 
by the Athenians, the latter by the Carthaginians. 



VENETIA 


GALLIA 



Map 7. Rome-Sicily-Carthage, 212 bc 

For want of better information, the political history of ancient Sicily has to 
be written in terms of successive Syracusan tyrants, who ruled through a bloody 
succession of coups and tumults.- Dionysius the Elder (r. 405-367) was cited 
by Aristotle as an example of the type of tyrant 'who gains power by demagogic 
appeals to the poorer classes'. His relative, Dion (r. 357-354), who had been 
personally tutored in the ways of a philosopher-king by Plato and the Academy, 
seized control of Syracuse after sailing from Greece in a pre-run of Garibaldi's 
Thousand. Timoleon (r. 344-36), the Corinthian 'son of liberty', was another 
who triumphed with the aid of mercenaries; but he seems to have introduced 
democratic constitutions in many of the cities, and succeeded in fixing a 
boundary on the River Halycus between the Greek and the Carthaginian spheres. 
The cruel Agathocles (r. 317-289) was a plebeian potter who rose by marrying a 
wealthy widow. In 310 bc he resolved the second Carthaginian siege of Syracuse 
by carrying the war into Africa. This self-styled 'King of Sicily' was said to have 
been paralysed by a poisoned toothpick and laid out on his funeral pyre alive. In 





the next generation Syracuse was saved from Rome's expanding power by 
Pyrrhus, the adventurer-King of Epirus, who left the field clear for the long reign 
of his Syracusan supporter, King Hieron II (r. 269-215). Hieron II, patron of 
Archimedes, preserved the peace through an unbroken treaty with Rome and 
gave Syracuse its last spell of independent affluence. Hieron's death, however, at 
a crucial moment in the Punic Wars, precipitated a struggle between pro-Roman 
and pro-Carthaginian factions. His grandson and successor, Hieronymus, 
abandoned the Roman alliance, only to be overthrown by a popular revolt that 
overwhelmed first the royal family and then the Roman party. 

In 215 the election of two Carthaginians as ruling magistrates in Syracuse 
greatly aroused Roman anxieties. Shortly afterwards four Roman legions were 
transported to Sicily, and a casus belli was found in a border skirmish. Marcellus 
laid siege to Syracuse, by land and by sea, late in 214 or possibly in early 213. 
For the besiegers, the year was 538 auc. Their rivalry with Carthage was the 
central political feature of the era. It was a natural extension of Rome's earlier 
conquest of southern Italy. Carthage was the established power, Rome the 
challenger. The First Punic War (267-241) had been provoked by Roman 
intervention in a local quarrel between Hieron of Syracuse and the city of 
Messana; and it had ended with Rome's annexation of all Carthaginian 
possessions in Sicily. Carthage made up for its loss by the creation of a new 
colony in eastern Iberia, where in 227 Carthagonova (Cartagena) was founded. 
Rome watched these developments with intense suspicion; and the Second Punic 
War was provoked by Roman intervention at Saguntum in Iberia, despite a treaty 
recognizing Carthaginian rule up to the Ebro. Hannibal had then carried the war 
to the gates of Rome, causing a general conflagration in which the strategic 
control of the central Mediterranean was at stake. Syracuse was the pivot. 

M. Claudius Marcellus (d. 208), five times consul, was a pious hero-warrior 
of the old Roman school. In his first consulship in 222 he had slain the King of 
the Insubrian Gauls in single combat on the plain near Milan, and had dedicated 
the whole of his Gallic spoils to the temple of Jupiter Feretrius. He was due to 
die in battle, ambushed by Hannibal. He earned himself a Fife by Plutarch. By 
all accounts, which include those of Fivy and Polybius as well as Plutarch, the 
Roman siege of Syracuse was laid with high hopes of quick success. Marcellus 
was opposed by the unbreached walls and by confident defenders. Yet, in 
addition to three legions of perhaps 25,000 men, he was armed with 100 
warships, a huge train of siege engines, and by the knowledge that Syracusan 
counsels were divided. He had reckoned on everything, writes Fivy, except on 



one man. 

That man was Archimedes, unicus spectator caeli siderumque, 'that 
unrivalled observer of the heaven and the stars, even more remarkable as the 
inventor and engineer of artillery and engines of war'.- Throughout the reign of 
Hieron II, Archimedes had been building an arsenal of ingenious anti-siege 
machines of every range and calibre. 

Livy's account of the scene when the Roman troops approached the sea¬ 
walls makes good reading: 

The wall of Achradina... which is washed by the sea, was attacked by Marcellus 
with sixty-five quinquiremes. From most of the ships, archers and slingers... 
allowed hardly anyone to stand on the wall without being wounded. 

Other five-bankers, paired and lashed together ... and propelled by the outer 
banks of oars like a single ship, brought up siege-towers several storeys high, 
together with engines for battering the wall. 

Against this naval equipment, Archimedes had lined the walls with artillery 
of various sizes. Ships lying offshore were bombarded with a regular discharge 
of stones of great weight. The nearer vessels were attacked with lighter but much 
more frequent missiles. 

Finally, to let his men discharge their bolts without exposure to wounds, he 
opened up the wall from top to bottom with numerous loopholes about a cubit 
wide. Through these, without being seen, some shot at the enemy with arrows, 
others from small protected 'scorpions'.- 

Polybius relates that the floating siege-towers were called sambucae, since their 
shape resembled that of a musical instrument of that name, no doubt an ancestor 
of the modern Greek bouzouki. 

Most disconcerting were Archimedes' devices for lifting the attackers clean 
out of the water: 

Huge beams were suddenly projected from the walls, right over the ships, which 
could then be sunk by great weights released from on high. Other ships were 
grabbed at the prow by iron claws, or beaks, like those of cranes, winched up 
into the air, then dropped stern first into the depths. Others again were spun 
round and round by means of machinery inside the city, and dashed on the steep 
cliffs ... with great destruction of the fighting men on board ... Frequently, a 


ship would be lifted into mid-air, and whirled hither and thither... until its crew 
had been thrown out in all directions...- 

Marcellus recognized a superior adversary. 'Let us stop fighting this 
geometrical giant/ he exclaimed, 'who uses our ships to ladle water from the 
sea/ Or again, 'Our sambuca band has been whipped out of the banquet/ 
Plutarch commented, 'The Romans seemed to be fighting against the Gods/ 

With the assault abandoned, the siege turned into a blockade that lasted for 
two years. The Syracusans remained buoyant for many months. A Carthaginian 
relief force set up camp in the valley of the Anapus, requiring Marcellus to bring 
a fourth legion from Panormus. A naval sortie left the harbour successfully, and 
returned with a fleet of reinforcements. In the interior of the island a Roman 
massacre of the citizens of Henna, a city sacred to Proserpina, turned the 
Sicilians against them. In the spring of 212 Marcellus mounted a night raid on 
the Galeagra Tower during the Festival of Artemis, and broke through the 
Hexapyloi Gate into the suburb of Epipolae. But the main fortresses held firm. In 
the summer the Carthaginian admiral, Bomilcar, gathered a vast fleet of 700 
transports, protected by 130 warships. With clear superiority, he lay in wait for 
the Roman fleet off Cape Pachynum. At the last moment, for reasons unknown, 
he declined Marceilus' offer of battle, stood out to sea, and sailed on to 
Tarentum. 

In the end, the outcome of the siege was decided by plague and by treachery. 
The Carthaginians, who had been struck by the plague when attacking Syracuse 
two centuries earlier, were now decimated by the same disease when trying to 
defend it. Then, with parleys in progress, an Iberian captain called Moeriscus, 
one of three prefects of Achradina, decided to save his skin by letting the 
Romans in near the Fountain of Arethusa. On the agreed signal, during a 
diversionary attack, he opened the gate. After setting guards on the houses of the 
pro-Roman faction, Marcellus gave Syracuse to plunder. 

Archimedes was counted among the many victims. Later tradition held that 
he was killed by a Roman soldier whilst working on a mathematical problem 
traced in the sand. Plutarch reviewed the various versions in circulation: 

As it happened, Archimedes was on his own, working out some problem with the aid of a diagram. Having 
fixed his mind on his study, he was not aware of the Romans' incursion. 

Suddenly, a soldier came upon him with drawn sword, and ordered him to Marcellus. Archimedes 
refused until he had finished his problem... Whereupon the soldier flew into a rage, and despatched him. 

Others say that the Roman... had threatened to kill him at once, and that Archimedes, when he saw 


him, had earnestly begged him to wait so that the result would not be left without demonstration. But the 
soldier paid no attention, and made an end of him there and then. 

There is a third story, that some soldiers fell in with Archimedes as he was taking some of his scientific 
instruments to Marcellus, such as sun-dials, spheres, and quadrants. They slew him, thinking that he was 
carrying gold. 

It is generally agreed, however, that Marcellus was greatly troubled by the death, and shunned the 
killer, seeking out the relatives of Archimedes and paying them his respects .- 1 

Such was the impact when Greek civilization met Roman power. 

At his own expressed wish, Archimedes was buried in a tomb designed as a 
sphere inside a cylinder. He once said that the ratio of 2 : 3, as expressed in a 
sphere and cylinder of similar length and diameter, offered the most pleasing of 
proportions. 

The fall of Syracuse had immediate consequences. On the cultural front, it 
underlined Rome's obsession with everything Greek. The artistic loot, wrote 
Livy, was no less than if Carthage itself had been sacked. It created the fashion 
for Greek artefacts and Greek ideas which henceforth became the norm for all 
educated Romans. It was probably the single most powerful stimulus in the 
growth of a shared Graeco-Roman culture. On the strategic front, it completed 
the Roman hold on Sicily. It cut off Carthage from a major source of trade and 
food, and deprived Hannibal of his principal source of logistical support. Before 
Syracuse, Rome was an equal player in the three-sided Greek-Carthaginian- 
Roman power game. After Syracuse, Rome held the initiative in all directions. 

In the longer term, the Romans' success in Sicily encouraged their further 
embroilment in Greek affairs. During the siege of Syracuse, Rome had just 
opened an alliance with the Aetolian League in central Greece, in order to 
outflank Carthage's other ally, Macedonia. From then on, Rome had Greek 
clients to be satisfied and interests to be protected. Three Macedonian Wars 
(215-205, 200-197, and 171-168), and the struggle against Macedonia's chief 
associate, Antiochus III of Syria, brought the Romans into Greece with a 
vengeance. In the end, as in Sicily, Rome decided to terminate the complications 
by turning the whole of Macedonia and the Peloponnese into Roman provinces. 

At the time, the fall of Syracuse must have been soon forgotten, even by the 
Syracusans. They were lucky to escape the fate of other defeated cities, where 
the whole of the surviving population was habitually sold into slavery. After all, 


it was just one event in the endless series of campaigns and battles that 
accompanied the rise of Rome and the demise of Greece. On consideration, 
however, it may be seen to be symptomatic of shifts and changes that were to 
affect a much wider constituency than that of central Mediterranean politics. 

Historians who look back at Rome's triumphant expansion are locked into 
the knowledge of subsequent developments. They are fully aware that the 
resultant Graeco-Roman culture was destined to dominate the whole of the 
classical world, and to exert a lasting influence as one of the pillars of 'Western 
civilization'. Their antennae are less sensitive to other trends and prospects 
which existed alongside it. Equally, fully equipped with a knowledge of Greek 
and Latin, the standard vehicles of higher education in modern Europe, they 
have sometimes been slow to relate the growth of the Graeco-Roman sphere to 
the full panorama of contemporary events. No one could fairly deny that the 
fusion of the Greek and Roman worlds, in which the fall of Syracuse was a 
signal moment, was a process of capital importance. The difficulty is to see what 
other perspectives were in the offing. 

No record has survived of Syracusan reflections at the time of the siege. But 
many of the citizens of a merchant city must have travelled widely. They lived 
on an island which had long been contested between Greeks and Carthaginians 
and only recently invaded by Romans. As a result, whatever side they favoured 
in the Punic Wars, they must surely have seen the Carthaginians, like 
themselves, as members of an ancient order challenged by Roman upstarts. 
Indeed, as a seagoing commercial nation they would probably have felt a deeper 
affinity with Carthage than with Rome. Certainly, living more than a century 
after Alexander put the Greeks into intimate contact with Persia and India, they 
must surely have felt themselves to be part of that Graeco-oriental world of 
Hellenism than of a Graeco-Roman world which had not yet been delivered. For 
them, the centre of the world was undoubtedly neither Carthage nor Rome, but 
Alexandria. 

Modern perspectives have often placed Syracuse as a Greek and therefore a 
European city whose new bond with European Rome was a natural, if not an 
inevitable, development. They instinctively avoid the suggestion that the Greeks 
were more Asiatic than European at this juncture, or that they might well have 
maintained their oriental connections indefinitely. Few courses on Western 
civilization which honour Archimedes would point out that the great 
mathematical genius gave his life opposing the union of his Greek city with 



Rome. 

Four years after the battle of Cannae (see p. 155) Rome's position was still 
extremely precarious. It would have been entirely reasonable for the 
Carthaginian party to calculate that Marcellus lacked the strength to take 
Syracuse by assault; that Roman failure at Syracuse would give heart to 
Carthage's other allies; that the reassertion of Carthaginian power in Sicily 
would guarantee proper logistical support for Hannibal; that Hannibal, 
effectively supplied, would break the stalemate in Italy, that Rome, in other 
words, had every chance of being defeated. There was no Cato in Syracuse; but 
the razing of troublesome cities was an established practice. In the long watches 
on the Syracusan walls, it was entirely possible that some of Archimedes' men, if 
not Archimedes himself, could have realistically mused: Roma delenda est -that 
is, until the plague struck and Moeriscus opened the gate. 

The Syracusans' knowledge of the world would have been largely confined to 
the Great Sea, and to the countries of the East. The science of geography had 
made great advances in classical Greece, although the frontiers of the world 
directly known to the ancients had not radically changed. A contemporary of 
Archimedes, Eratosthenes of Cyrene (276-196), librarian at Alexandria, had 
concluded that the world was a sphere; and his work was known to Ptolemy and 
Strabo. But, apart from the Phoenician route to the Tin Islands, little progress 
was made in practical exploration. No known contact was ever made with West 
Africa, with the Americas, or with the more distant parts of northern Europe. 
The rigid division between the 'civilized' world of the Mediterranean shoreline 
and the 'barbarian' wilderness beyond was not overcome. 

In the late third century Mediterranean civilization was still made up of three 
major spheres of influence: Carthaginian in the West, Romano-Italic in the 
centre, Greek-Hellenic in the East. Thanks to Alexander's conquests, it was 
more closely tied than previously to the oriental empires from Egypt to India. 
Along the fragile tracks of Central Asia, it had some slight link with the Empire 
of China which at that very moment had begun to construct its Great Wall 
against nomadic incursions. 

Over the previous centuries, the barbarian wilderness of northern and central 
Europe had begun the slow transition from the Bronze to the Iron Age. It had 
been strongly marked by the dominant influence of the Celts, whose culture had 
taken hold, whether by migration or osmosis, at most points from the middle 



Vistula to Iberia, Gaul, and Britain. The Celts had stormed Rome in 387, and had 
moved in force into northern Italy. Celtic hill-forts had created a permanent 
network of urban stations, and their commercial activities formed an important 
intermediary for the Germanic, Slavic, and Baltic tribes further afield. In the late 
third century one branch of the Celts, the Galatians, who were established in 
their kingdom of Tyle in Thrace (on the territory of modern Bulgaria), were 
facing revolt by their Thracian subjects and preparing the move to neighbouring 
Asia Minor, where they lingered until medieval times. Their sojourn in Thrace 
has been confirmed by the recent discovery of inscriptions at Seuthopolis and 
Messembria (Nesebar).- 

In the third century bc, however, many historians would consider that the 
European Peninsula was at least 1,000 years away from anything recognizable as 
European civilization. In particular, the Europeanness of ancient Greece is being 
questioned as an anachronistic, intellectual construction of latter-day Europeans. 
Which is all very proper. 

Yet the two most striking processes of that age-the fusion of Graeco- 
Roman civilization in the Mediterranean and the supremacy of the Celts across 
much of the interior-put two essential building-blocks into place for the 
developments of the future. There was little trace of a common culture or 
common ideology, though both Graeco-Romans and Celts were Indo-Europeans 
(see Chapter IV). There was absolutely no inkling of a common identity. None 
the less, one has to concede that these were the peoples whose descendants and 
traditions were to find themselves at the core of later European history. It is one 
thing to correct the excessively Eurocentric interpretations of the ancient world, 
which have prevailed for too long. It is quite another to go to the other extreme, 
and to maintain that Greeks and Romans hold little or no relevance to the later 
European story. 

There are certain events which happened, and whose consequences are still with 
us. One cannot pretend otherwise. If Moeriscus had not opened the gate; if 
Syracuse had resisted the Romans as it once resisted the Athenians; if Hannibal 
had destroyed Rome as Rome would soon destroy Carthage; if, as a result, the 
Greek world had eventually fused with Semitic Carthage, then history would 
have been rather different. The point is: Moeriscus did open the gate. 



* The Tauric Peninsula's modern name, Krym or Crimea, derives from the 
Turkish word kerim meaning 'fortress', and dates only from the 15th century.

ROMA 

Ancient Rome, 753 BC-AD 337 


There is a quality of cohesiveness about the Roman world which applied neither 
to Greece nor perhaps to any other civilization, ancient or modern. Like the 
stones of a Roman wall, which were held together both by the regularity of the 
design and by that peculiarly powerful Roman cement, so the various parts of the 
Roman realm were bonded into a massive, monolithic entity by physical, 
organizational, and psychological controls. The physical bonds included the 
network of military garrisons which were stationed in every province, and the 
network of stone-built roads which linked the provinces with Rome. The 
organizational bonds were based on the common principles of law and 
administration, and on the universal army of officials who enforced common 
standards of conduct. The psychological controls were built on fear and 
punishment-on the absolute certainty that anyone or anything that threatened 
the authority of Rome would be utterly destroyed. 

The source of the Roman obsession with unity and cohesion may well have 
lain in the pattern of Rome's early development. Whereas Greece had grown 
from scores of scattered cities, Rome grew from one single organism. Whilst the 
Greek world had expanded along the Mediterranean sea lanes, the Roman world 
was assembled by territorial conquest. Of course, the contrast is not quite so 
stark: in Alexander the Great the Greeks had found the greatest territorial 
conqueror of all time; and the Romans, once they moved outside Italy, did not 







fail to learn the lessons of sea power. Yet the essential difference is undeniable. 
The key to the Greek world lay in its high-prowed ships; the key to Roman 
power lay in its marching legions. The Greeks were wedded to the sea, the 
Romans to the land. The Greek was a sailor at heart, the Roman a landsman. 

Certainly, in trying to explain the Roman phenomenon, one would have to 
place great emphasis on this almost animal instinct for the 'territorial 
imperative'. Roman priorities lay in the organization, exploitation, and defence 
of their territory. In all probability it was the fertile plain of Latium that created 
the habits and skills of landed settlement, landed property, landed economy, 
landed administration, and a land-based society. From this arose the Roman 
genius for military organization and orderly government. In turn, a deep 
attachment to the land, and to the stability which rural life engenders, fostered 
the Roman virtues: gravitas, a sense of responsibility, pietas, a sense of devotion 
to family and country, and iusti-tia, a sense of the natural order. 'Tillers of the 
soil make the strongest men and the bravest soldiers,' wrote the Elder Cato.- 

Modern attitudes to Roman civilization range from the infinitely impressed 
to the thoroughly disgusted. As always, there are the power-worshippers, 
especially among historians, who are predisposed to admire whatever is strong, 
who feel more attracted to the might of Rome than to the subtlety of Greece. 
They admire the size and strength of the Colosseum with never a thought for the 
purposes to which it was put. The Colosseum, in fact, became the symbol of 
Roman civilization. It became a commonplace: 'When falls the Colosseum, 
Rome shall fall; and when Rome falls-the World.' 2 At the same time there is a 
solid body of opinion which dislikes Rome. For many, Rome is at best the 
imitator and the continuator of Greece on a larger scale. Greek civilization had 
quality, Rome mere quantity. Greece was original, Rome derivative. Greece had 
style, Rome had money. Greece was the inventor, Rome the Research and 
Development division. Such indeed was the opinion of some of the more 
intellectual Romans. 'Had the Greeks held novelty in such disdain as we,' asked 
Horace in his Epistles, 'what work of ancient date would now exist?' What is 
more, the Romans vulgarized many of the things which they copied. In 
architecture, for example, they borrowed the heavy and luxurious late Corinthian 
order, but not the Doric or the Ionian. 'The whole fabric of Greek art goes to 
pieces', writes one critic, 'when it is brought into contact with a purely utilitarian 
nation like Rome.'- 

Rome's debt to Greece, however, was enormous. In religion, the Romans 


adopted the Olympians wholesale-turning Zeus into Jupiter, Hera into Juno, 
Ares into Mars, Aphrodite into Venus. They adopted Greek moral philosophy to 
the point where Stoicism was more typical of Rome than of Athens. In literature, 
Greek writers were consciously used as models by their Latin successors. It was 
absolutely accepted that an educated Roman should be fluent in Greek. In 
speculative philosophy and the sciences, the Romans made virtually no advance 
on earlier achievements. 

Yet it would be wrong to suggest that Rome was somehow a junior partner in 
Graeco-Roman civilization. The Roman genius was projected into new spheres 
- especially into those of law, military organization, administration, and 
engineering. Moreover, the tensions which arose within the Roman state 
produced literary and artistic sensibilities of the highest order. It was no accident 
that many leading Roman soldiers and statesmen were writers of high calibre. 
Equally, the long list of Roman vices cannot be forgotten. Critics have pointed to 
a specially repulsive brand of slavery, to cruelty beyond measure, and, in time, to 
a degree of decadence that made hellenism look puritanical. 

In its widest definition, from the founding of the 'Eternal City' in 753 bc to the 
final destruction of the Roman Empire in ad 1453, the political history of 
ancient Rome lasted for 2,206 years. In its more usual definition, from the 
founding of the city to the collapse of that western segment of the Roman 
Empire of which Rome was the capital, it lasted for barely half that time. It is 
customarily divided into three distinct periods: the Kingdom, the Republic, and 
the Empire, [auc] 

The semi-legendary Roman Kingdom corresponds in many ways to the 
earlier 'Heroic Age 5 of Greece. It begins with the tale of Romulus and Remus, 
the orphaned twins, reputedly descendants of Aeneas, who were suckled by a 
she-wolf, and it ends with the expulsion of the last of the seven kings, Tarquin 
the Proud, in 510 bc. Those two-and-a-half centuries lie long before the era of 
recorded history. Romulus, the founder of Rome, supposedly organized the Rape 
of the Sabine Women, who helped to populate the new city. Numa Pompilius, a 
Sabine, introduced the calendar and the official religious practices. He founded 
the Temple of Janus in the Forum, whose doors were opened in time of war and 
closed in times of peace. Tullius Hostilius, the third king, a Latin, razed the 
neighbouring city of Alba Longa and deported its population. Ancus Marcius 
created the order of plebs or 'common people 5 from imported captives. Servius 



Tullius, the sixth king, granted Rome its first constitution, giving the plebs 
independence from the patricians or 'elders', and created the Latin League. The 
fifth and seventh kings, Tarquinius Priscus and Tarquinius Superbus, were of 
Etruscan descent. The former undertook the first public works in Rome, 
including the vast sewer named after him. The latter was expelled, following the 
Rape of Lucretia organized by his son. [etruscheria] 

Rome, with its seven hills commanding the strategic crossing-point of the 
River Tiber, was but one of several cities of Latium that spoke the 'Latin' 
tongue. In those early years it was dominated by more powerful neighbours, 
especially by the Etruscans to the north, whose fortified city of Veii lay only 16 
km from the Forum. The remains of the 'Etruscan Places' at Vulci, Tarquinia, 
and Perugia attest to an advanced but mysterious civilization. Rome borrowed 
much from them. According to Livy, the city only survived the Etruscan attempt 
to storm it and to reinstate the Tarquins after the one-eyed Horatius Codes had 
held the Sublician Bridge: 

Then out spake brave Horatius 
The Captain of the Gate: 

'To every man upon this earth 
Death cometh soon or late; 

And how can man die better 
Than facing fearful odds, 

For the ashes of his fathers 
And the temples of his Gods? 

Hew down the bridge, Sir Consul, 

With all the speed ye may: 


AUC 

Roman chronology was based on the conventional date for the founding of 
the city. Zero year was long taken to be equivalent to 750 bc. All subsequent 
dates were calculated auc, ab urbe condita, 'from the founding of the city'. 
A modified scheme came into being in the first century BC, when the 




computations of M. Terentius Varro (636-725 auc), 'the most learned of the 
Romans', made the city's foundation equivalent to 753 bc. 

By Varro's time, however, most Romans had also become accustomed to 
an alternative system, which referred not to the date of the year but to the 
names of the annual consuls. Both in official records and in everyday 
conversations, they talked of 'the year of C. Terentius Varro and L. Aemilius 
Paulus' (216 BC), or of 'the seven consulships of C. Marius' (107, 
104,103,102,101, 100, and 86 bc). One needed a detailed grasp of Roman 
history to follow the references. Few educated people would not have known 
that the elder Varro and Aemilius Paulus had commanded the Roman army 
at the disaster of Cannae. 

Fortunately, the two systems were compatible. Each of them could be 
invoked to support the other. For example, the rise and fall of G. lulius 
Caesar could be calculated with reference to the following: 


auc Consulship bc 

695 M. Calpurnius Bibulus and C. lulius Caesar (I) 59 

705 C. Claudius Marcellus and L. Cornelius Lentulus Crus 49 

706 C. lulius Caesar (II) and P. Servilius Vatia Isauricus 48 

707 Q. Rufius Calenus and P. Vatinius 47 

708 C. lulius Caesar (III) and M. Aemilius Lepidus 46 

709 C. lulius Caesar (IV) Sole Consul 45 

710 C. lulius Caesar (V) and M. Antonius 44 


C. Vibius Pansa and A. Hirtius, both killed; replaced by the Triumvirate of M. Antonius, G. ^ 

Octavianus, and M. Aemilius Lepidus. 

It was Caesar who realized that the existing calendar was becoming 
inoperable. The old Roman year contained only 304 days divided into 10 
months, beginning on xi Kal. Maius or 21 April. The extra months of 
lanuarius and Februarius had been invented as stop-gaps. In 708 auc, 
therefore, during Caesar's third consulship, drastic reforms were introduced. 
The current year was prolonged by 151 days so that the New Year could 
begin on 1 January 707 auc/45 bc and run over twelve months of 365 days 
until 31 December. Further adjustments were made under Augustus in 737 
auc/ad 4, when the old fifth and sixth months, Quintilis and Sextilis, were 
renamed Julius (after Caesar) and Augustus, and the four-yearly bissextile or 
'leap-day' was introduced. The resultant Julian Year of 365 1/4 days was 
misaligned with the earth only by the tiny margin of 11 minutes 12 seconds, 
and remained in universal use until ad 1582. 

None the less, consuls continued to be appointed throughout the 



Principate; and the custom of counting years by consulships was preserved 
with them. The regnal years of the emperors were not usually invoked. In the 
later Empire, when consulships were abolished, the auc system was 
supported by references to the fifteen-year tax cycle of 'Indictions'. When 
the Christian era finally came into use in the mid-sixth century ad, the 
Roman era had been in operation for thirteen centuries. 1 [anno domini] 


I, with two more to help me, 

Will hold the foe in play. 

In yon straight path a thousand 
May well be stopped by three. 

Now who will stand on either hand 
And keep the bridge with me?' 

'Horatius', quoth the Consul, 

'As thou sayest, so let it be.' 

And straight against that great array 
Forth went the dauntless Three. 

For Romans in Rome's quarrel 
Spared neither land nor gold, 

Nor son nor wife, nor limb nor life, 

In the brave days of old.- 

The Roman Republic presided over the city's growth from provincial 
obscurity to mastery of the whole Mediterranean. The process began in 509 bc 
with the first election of the ruling consuls, and ended 478 years later, when 
Octavian established the first imperial dynasty. It was an epoch of incessant 
conquest. In the fifth century, Rome gained a hold over its immediate neighbours 
and a territory of 822 km 2 (314 square miles). In one famous episode, in 491 bc, 
the Roman exile G. Marcius Coriolanus, who had led an all-conquering Volscian 
army to the gates of Rome, was persuaded to desist by the tearful entreaties of 
his mother. In the fourth century Rome recovered from its sack by the Gauls in 
390 bc, and in the three fierce Samnite Wars established its supremacy over 
central Italy. In the third century Rome undertook the conquest of the Greek 





south, first in the war against Pyrrhus, King of Epirus (282-272 bc), who came 
to the aid of his compatriots, and later in successive campaigns ending with the 
annexation of Sicily (see pp. 138-47, above). These campaigns provoked 
extended conflict with Carthage, and the three Punic Wars. 

Of all Rome's wars it was the hundred years' conflict with Carthage that best 
demonstrated that famous Roman combination of stamina and ruthlessness. 
Older than Rome, African Carthage had been founded by migrants from 
Phoenicia, in Latin Punka (see pp. 104-6). Relations between them had 
traditionally been pacific, protected by a treaty contained in the oldest known 
document of Roman history. Dated in the first year of Republic, the treaty 
enjoined each side to respect the other's sphere of influence. The peace was kept 
for nearly three centuries before Roman forces crossed the Straits of Messina. 


ETRU SCHERIA 

At Santa Severa, ancient Pyrgi, near Rome, archaeologists have uncovered 
two Etruscan temples overlooking the sea. The find, made in 1957-64, was 
exceptional. It was the first Etruscan site that offered something other than 
tombs. Dated c.500 bc, it yielded three wafer-thin gold tablets, with 
inscriptions in Punic and Etruscan: 

To the lady Astarte. This is the sacred place made and given by Thefarie 
Velianas, king of Cisra, in the month of the Sacrifice of the Sun ... in the 
third year of his reign, in the month of Kir, of the Day of the Burial of the 
Divinity. And the years of the statue of the goddess [are as many] as these 
stars. 1 

Pyrgi served as harbour to the nearby town of Cisra (modern Cerveteri); and 
King Thefarie or 'Tiberius' had chosen to worship a Carthaginian Goddess, 
[tammuz] The temples must have been dedicated some time after the 
abortive Etruscan raid on Greek Cumae on the Bay of Naples, perhaps 
within a decade of the revolt of Rome against Etruscan overlordship. 

The Etruscans flourished in Tuscany and Umbria from 700 to 100 BC. 
They claimed to be immigrants from Asia Minor. Their alphabet, derived 




from the Greek, is easily read, but their language has not been fully 
deciphered. After the initial era of princes, they passed in the sixth century 
into the era of mercantile city-states on the Greek model. Their grave- 
chambers are covered in fine, stylized, pictorial murals often depicting 
banquets of the dead (see Plate 5). The little that is known about them 
derives either from archaeology or from hostile Roman accounts of a later 
age, when they are painted as gluttons, lechers, and religious devotees. From 
the first Etruscan exhibition in London in 1837 to its most recent successor 
in Paris in 1992, 2 many attempts have been made to interest the European 
public in Etruscology. The greatest stimulus came in 1828-36, from the 
opening of tombs at Vulci, Caere, and Tarquinia, then in the Papal States. 

But the dominant mode has been one of Romantic speculation. The 
Medici, who organized the first investigations, claimed to be of Etruscan 
descent. In the eighteenth century, Josiah Wedgwood named his pottery 
'Etruria 5 unaware that the fashionable 'Etruscan Style 5 was of Greek, not 
Etruscan, origin. Prosper Merimee was beguiled by the mystery of the 
Etruscans, as was the Victorian pioneer George Dennis. And so was D. H. 
Lawrence: 

The things [the Etruscans] did in their easy centuries were as natural as 
breathing. And that is the true Etruscan quality: ease, naturalness, and an 
abundance of life ... And death was just a natural continuance of the fullness 
of life. 3 

This is not Etruscology; it is Etruscheria, or, as the French would say, 
etruscomanie. 


In the First Punic War (264-241) Carthage itself remained relatively immune 
from Roman landpower, although its hold on Sicily was lost. Rome learned the 
arts of naval warfare. In the Second Punic War (218-201), which followed 
Hannibal's spectacular expedition across the Alps from Spain to Italy, Rome 
recovered by sheer persistence from the brink of annihilation. The Celts of 
northern Italy were in revolt, as was much of Sicily; and the road to Rome was 
left almost undefended. The two battles of Lake Trasimeno (217) and Cannae 
(216) belong to Rome's most crushing defeats. Only the tactics of Q. Fabius 
Maximus 'Cunctator 5 , 'The Delayer 5 , the dogged nursing of resources, and the 
capture of Syracuse (see pp. 142-4) enabled Rome to survive. Hannibal's 




brother Hasdrubal was thwarted in a second attempt to invade Italy from Spain, 
and in 203 Hannibal himself was forced to withdraw. He was followed to Africa 
by the young Publius Cornelius Scipio 'Africanus', survivor of Cannae, 
conqueror of Cartagena. At Zama in 202, Hannibal met his match. Taking refuge 
with the enemies of Rome in Greece, he was eventually harried to suicide. 

Carthage, deprived of its fleet and paying heavy tribute, survived for sixty 
years more. But in the Third Punic War (149-146 bc) the elder Cato raised the 
call for the enemy's complete destruction. Carthago delenda est. The deed was 
carried out in 146. The city was razed, the population sold into slavery, the site 
ploughed, and salt poured into the furrow. In Tacitus' words on another occasion, 
the Romans 'created a desert and called it peace'. Scipio Aemilianus, watching 
the scene in the company of the historian Polybius, was moved to quote the 
words of Hector in the Iliad: 'The day shall come when sacred Troy shall fall.' 
When asked what he meant he replied: 'This is a glorious moment, Polybius, yet 
I am seized with foreboding that some day the same fate will befall my own 
country' 

As the challenge of Carthage was neutralized, and then removed, the 
triumphant legions of the Republic began to pick off the remaining countries of 
the Mediterranean. Cisalpine Gaul was conquered between 241 and 190. Iberia 
and much of northern Africa came as a prize in 201. Illyria was conquered 
between 229 and 168. Macedonia, together with mainland Greece, was taken 
over by 146. Transalpine Gaul was invaded in 125 bc, and finally subdued by 
Caesar in 58-50 bc. The independent kingdoms of Asia Minor were annexed in 
67-61 bc, Syria and Palestine by 64 bc. [egnatia] 

In the last hundred years of the Republic's existence the foreign campaigns 
became entangled in a series of civil wars. Successful generals sought to control 
the central government in Rome, whilst would-be reformers sought to satisfy the 
demands of the lower orders. The resultant strife led to intermittent periods of 
chaos and of dictatorial rule. In 133-121 bc the popular tribunes Tiberius 
Sempronius Gracchus and his brother, G. Sempronius Gracchus, attempted to 
allocate public lands to displaced peasants who had served in the Republic's 
conquests. Both were opposed by the ruling oligarchy, and both were slain. In 
82-79 L. Sulla Felix declared himself Dictator after defeating the partisans of G. 
Marius (157-86), the greatest soldier of his age. In 60 bc three rival soldier- 
politicians, M. Licinius Crassus, Pompeius Magnus, and C. Iulius Caesar, 
formed the first ruling triumvirate. But in 48 bc Caesar claimed the title of 


Imperator after crushing the faction of the remaining triumvir, Pompey. Finally, 
in 31 bc, after the fall of the second triumvirate, Octavian brought the civil wars 
to a close. His victory at Actium brought about the surrender of Egypt, the death 
of Antony and Cleopatra, the end of opposition, and his assumption of the title of 
'Augustus'. In this way the last gasp of the Roman Republic coincided with the 
capture of the last piece of the Mediterranean coast which had remained at least 
nominally independent. In almost 500 years the gates of the Temple of Janus had 
been closed on only three occasions, [aquila] 


EGNATIA 

Of all the Roman roads, the Via Egnatia proved to be one of the most vital. 
Built in the second century bc, it linked Rome with Byzantium and hence, in 
a later age, the Western with the Eastern Empire. It took its name from the 
city of Egnatia in Apulia, the site of a miraculous fiery altar and a main stage 
between Rome and the Adriatic port of Brindisium. In Italy it provided an 
alternative route to the older Via Appia, which reached the same destination 
through Beneventum and Tarentum. On the eastern Adriatic shore, its 
starting-point was at Dyracchion (Durres), with a feeder road from 
Apollonia. It crossed the province of Macedonia, passing Lychnidos 
(Ochrid) and Pella to reach Thessalonika. It skirted the Chalkidike peninsula 
at Amphipolis and Philippi, before terminating at Dypsela on the Hebros 
(Maritsa) in Thrace. 1 

The final section into Byzantium did not originally carry the name of 
Egnatia, and made a long inland detour to avoid the coastal lagoons. The 
direct route between Rhegion and Hebdomon was only paved by Justinian I, 
bringing the traveller to the Golden Gate of Constantinople after twenty days 
and over 500 miles. It was proverbial that 'all roads lead to Rome'. But all 
roads led away from Rome as well. 


The civil strife was the outward expression, above all, of a shift in political 
attitudes, which is well illustrated from the careers of the two Catos, both of 






whom supported the losing side. Marcus Porcius Cato, The Censor' (234-149 
bc), became a byword for the old Roman virtues of austerity and puritanism. 
After twenty-seven years of soldiering he retired to his farm to write books on 
history and agriculture. He railed against the wave of hellenistic luxury and 
sophistication, and in particular against the unprincipled careerism, as he saw it, 
of the Scipios. In his last years he called unrelentingly for the annihilation of 
Carthage. His great-grandson M. Porcius Cato Uticensis (95-46 bc) showed the 
same rectitude and obstinacy of character. A Stoic by training, he joined Pompey 
in the campaign to check the dictatorial ambitions of Caesar. When Pompey's 
cause was lost, he killed himself rather than submit, after a heroic journey across 
the Libyan desert which led only to encirclement in the town of Utica. He had 
spent his last night reading Plato's Phaedo, on the immortality of the soul. In this 
way he became a symbol of republican opposition to tyranny, of principled 
opposition. Cicero praised him. Caesar, in his Andcato, tried meanly to discredit 
him. The poet Lucan (ad 39-65), who also committed suicide rather than submit 
to a despot, makes him the champion of political freedom. Dante, after Lucan, 
makes him the guardian of Mount Purgatory, and hence of the path to spiritual 
liberty. 


AQUILA 

The eagle's ranking as 'king of the birds' is as ancient as the lion's as 'king 
of the beasts'. In Roman lore, it was Jupiter's 'storm-bird', carrier of the 
thunderbolt. Eagles figured as emblems of power and majesty in Babylon 
and Persia, and were adopted by the Roman general, Marius, after his 
oriental conquests. The legions of the Roman Empire marched behind eagle 
ensigns; and Roman consuls carried eagle-tipped sceptres. 1 (See Appendix 
III, p. 1228.) 

In Slavonic folklore, the three brothers, Lekh, Chekh, and Rus, set out to 
find their fortune. Rus went to the east, Chekh to the south to Bohemia, 
whilst Lekh crossed the plain to the west. Lekh stopped beside a lake under a 
great tree where a white eagle had built its nest. He was the father of the 
Poles; and Gniezno, the 'eagle's nest', was their first home. 

In Wales, too, the peak of Mount Snowdon, the heart of the national 




homeland, is called Eryri, 'the place of eagles'. 

In Christian symbolism the eagle is associated with St John the 
Evangelist (alongside the Angel and Axe of St Matthew, the Bull of St Luke, 
and the Lion of St Mark). It appears on the lecterns of churches, upholding 
the Bible on its outspread wings to repel the serpent of falsehood. According 
to St Jerome, it was the emblem of the Ascension. 

Throughout European history, the imperial eagle has been co-opted by 
rulers who claimed superiority over their fellow princes. Charlemagne wore 
an eagle-embossed cloak; and Canute the Great was buried in one. 2 Both 
Napoleon I and Napoleon III used eagle symbolism with relish. Napoleon's 
heir, the-King of Rome, received the sobriquet of aiglon or 'eaglet'. Only the 
British, to be different, betrayed no aquiline interests. 

Eagles recur throughout European heraldry, having been present at an 
earlier date in Islamic insignia. 3 Both Serbia and Poland boast a white eagle, 
the Polish one crowned (and temporarily uncrowned by the Communist 
regime). Both Tyrol and Brandenburg-Prussia sported a red eagle, the 
Swedish province of Varmland a blue one. The Federal Republic of 
Germany took a single stylized black eagle from the city arms of Aachen. 
Under the dynasty of the Palaeologues, the Byzantine Empire took on the 
emblem of a black, double-headed spread eagle, symbol of the Roman 
succession in East and West. In due course this passed to the Tsars of 
Moscow, 'the Third Rome', to the Holy Roman Emperors in Germany, and 
to the Habsburgs of Austria. 

Ein Adler fangt kerne Milcken, runs the German proverb: 'an eagle 
catches no midges'. 


C. Iulius Caesar (100-44 bc) led the decisive attack on the established 
procedures of the Republic. A successful general and administrator, he shared 
the first triumvirate from 60 bc with Pompey and Crassus, served as Consul and, 
from 59, Proconsul of the two Gauls. Caesar's enemies were disgusted by his 
shameless bribing of the Roman populace, by his manipulation of politicians, by 
the 'smash-and-grab' policy of his military campaigns. Cicero's protest-'O 
temporal O mores!'-is still with us. On 10 January 49 bc, when Caesar crossed 
the frontier of the province of Italia on the River Rubicon, he declared war on 




Rome. He shunned the outward trappings of monarchy, but his dictatorship was 
a reality, his name became synonymous with absolute power. He even succeeded 
in changing the calendar. He was assassinated on the Ides of March, 44 bc, by a 
group of republican conspirators headed by M. Brutus and C. Cassius Longinus, 
whom admirers have called the 'Liberators'. Brutus was a descendant of Rome's 
first Consul, who overthrew the Tarquins. Shakespeare called him 'the noblest 
Roman of them all'. Dante put him in the lowest circle of Hell for his betrayal of 
Caesar's friendship. 

After Caesar's death, the leadership of the Caesarian party was assumed by 
his nephew, Octavian. C. Octavius (b. 63 bc), whose name had been changed to 
C. Iulius Caesar Octavianus, when he was adopted as Caesar's official heir, was 
to change it again when all the battles were won. He served for twelve years in a 
second, shaky triumvirate with M. Aemilius Lepidus and M. Antonius (c.82-30 
bc), who together at Philippi suppressed the republican faction of Brutus and 
Cassius. But then he turned on his partners, and attacked the dominant Mark 
Antony. Octavian was master of the west, Mark Antony of the east; and the 
naval battle of Actium was a rather tame conclusion to a confrontation in which 
the combined forces of almost all the Roman world were ranged. But Actium 
was decisive: it ended the civil wars, finished off the Republic, and gave 
Octavian the supreme title of Augustus. 

The Empire, whose early years are widely referred to as 'the Principate', 
begins with the triumph of Augustus in 31 bc. It saw the marvellous Pax 
Romana, the 'Roman Peace', established from the Atlantic to the Persian Gulf. 
Although turbulent politics and murderous intrigues continued, especially in 
Rome, the provinces were firmly controlled, and wars were largely confined to 
the distant frontiers. A few new territories were acquired-Britannia in ad 43, 
Armenia in 63, Dacia in 105. But in the main the Empire was content to protect 
itself in Europe behind the limes or 'frontier line' from Hadrian's Wall to the 
Danube delta, and to fight in Asia against Rome's most formidable enemies-the 
Parthians and Persians, [aquincum] 


AQUINCUM 


Like neighbouring Carnuntum, Aquincum started life as a legionary camp 




on the Danube in the reign of Tiberius. It soon attracted a cluster of canabae 
or 'informal settlements', and in the second century ad was given the formal 
status of municipium. As a gateway to the Empire from the plains of 
Pannonia, it thrived mightily, both as a legionary base and as a commercial 
centre. Its prosperity is reflected in its twin amphitheatres, military and 
civilian, and the mural paintings which adorned its more opulent houses. 1 

The ruins of Aquincum lie in the suburbs of modem Budapest [buda] 
Like the English, the Hungarians had no direct experience of the Roman 
world, having migrated to their present homeland after the Empire's fall. But 
they cherish their 'Roman heritage' all the more. 2 [barbaros] 


Eventually, the imperial retreat had to begin. And retreat led to crumbling at 
the edges and demoralization at the centre. Already in the third century ad a rash 
of short-lived emperors signalled the weakening of the monolith. A partial 
recovery was staged by ordering the division of the Empire into East and West. 
But in the fourth century a marked shift of resources in favour of the East was 
accompanied by the decision to transfer the capital from Rome to Byzantium. 
That was in ad 330. Rome had reached its term as a political centre. The 
'eternity' of its rule over Kingdom, Republic, and Empire lasted exactly 1,083 
years. 

The motor of Roman expansion was far more powerful than that which had 
fuelled the growth of the Greek city-states or of Macedonia. Although the 
overall dimensions of Alexander's empire may briefly have exceeded those of 
the later Roman world, the area of land which Rome systematically settled and 
mobilized was undoubtedly the larger. From the outset Rome applied a variety of 
legal, demographic, and agrarian instruments which ensured that an incorporated 
territory contribute to the overall resources of the Roman war-machine. 
According to circumstance, the inhabitants of conquered districts would be 
granted the status either of full Roman citizenship, or of half-citizenship (civitas 
sine suffragio) or of Roman allies. In each case their duty to contribute money 
and soldiers was carefully assessed. Loyal soldiers were rewarded with generous 
grants of land, which would be surveyed and divided into regular plots. The 
result was a growing territory that needed ever more troops to defend it, and a 
growing army that needed ever more land to support it. A militarized society, 
where citizenship was synonymous with military service, developed an 




insatiable agrarian appetite. A fund of state land, the ager publicus, was held 
back to reward the state's most devoted servants, especially senators. 

Within this overall strategy, political arrangements could be extremely 
flexible. The introduction of uniform administration was not an immediate 
priority. Peninsular Italy, which was united under Roman rule at the end of the 
third century bc, had to wait 200 years for its reorganization into regular 
provinces. Local rulers were frequently left in place. Those who resisted, or 
rebelled, risked annihilation. In Greece, for example, resistance was undermined 
when in 146 bc the Roman general appeared at the Isthmian Games and 
announced that the city-states would be allowed to retain their autonomy. 
Corinth, which declined the offer, suffered the same fate as Carthage (and in the 
same year). 

Roman religious life was amazingly eclectic. Over the centuries the Romans 
came into contact with virtually all the gods of the Mediterranean, each of whose 
cults they added to their collection. In the early days, the devotion of a Roman 
family was centred on the household deities of hearth and barn. Civic life 
centred on a series of guardian cults, such as that of the Vestal Virgins, who 
tended the eternal flame, and on a complicated calendar of festivals presided 
over by the Pontifex Maximus. Later, the proximity of Magna Graecia led to the 
wholesale adoption of the Olympian pantheon. The first temple of Apollo was 
consecrated in Rome in 431 bc. The Epicureans, and especially the Stoics, also 
found many adherents. In late republican times, oriental mystery cults were 
popularized-among them that of Atargatis from Syria, of Cybele, the 'Magna 
Mater' of Asia Minor, and of Egyptian Isis. In imperial times, official religion 
shifted to the obligatory cult of recent or reigning emperors. Christianity took 
hold at a time when the Persian sun-god Mithras was increasingly cultivated, 
especially in the army. The gospel of love had to contend with the dualist 
doctrine of light and darkness, whose initiates bathed in bull's blood and 
celebrated the birth of their god on 25 December. Their subterranean oblations 
are imagined in the 'Hymn of the XXX Legion': 

Mithras, God of the Morning, our trumpets waken the Wall! 

Rome is above the nations, but Thou art over all! 

Now as the names are answered, and the guards are marched 

away, 

Mithras, also a soldier, give us strength for this day! 



Mithras, God of the Sunset, low on the western main- 

Thou descending immortal, immortal to rise again! 

Now when the watch is ended, now when the wine is drawn, 
Mithras, also a soldier, keep us pure till the dawn! 

Mithras, God of the Midnight, here where the great Bull 
dies, 

Look on Thy children in darkness. O take our sacrifice! 

Many roads Thou hast fashioned-all of them lead to the 
Light! 

Mithras, also a soldier, teach us to die aright!- [aricia] 

The Roman economy combined a large measure of self-sufficiency in the inland 
areas with extensive trade and commerce in the Mediterranean. Overland 
transport costs were high, despite the main roads, so provincial cities did not 
look beyond the surrounding districts for most commodities. But the seaborne 
traffic, first developed by Greeks and Phoenicians, was increased still further. 

Wine, oil, furs, pottery, metals, slaves, and corn were the standard cargoes, 
[CEDROS] 


ARICIA 

Adozen miles to the south of Rome, in a crater amidst the Alban hills, lies 
Lake Nemi, the 'lake of the grove'. In imperial times, the nearby village of 
Nemi was called Aricia; and throughout the Roman era the woods beside the 
lake sheltered the sacred Arician Grove, home of Diana nemorensis, 'The 
Diana of the Grove'. 

The Arician cult is known both from the writings of Strabo and from 
modern archaeology. In many ways, it was unremarkable. It involved the 
worship of a sacred oak, whose boughs were not to be broken, and a 
sanctuary of perpetual fire. Apart from Diana, it addressed two minor deities 
- Egeria, a water nymph, and Virbius, a fugitive from the wrath of Zeus. As 
shown by the surviving mounds of votive offerings, its main devotees were 
women who hoped to conceive. On the day of the annual summer festival, 
the grove was lit up by myriad torches, and women all over Italy burned 





fires in gratitude. 

In one respect, however, the cult was exceptional. The Chief Priest of 
Aricia, who bore the title of Rex Nemorensis or 'King of the Grove', was 
obliged to win his position by slaying his predecessor. At one and the same 
time he was priest, murderer, and prospective murder victim. Stalking the 
grove with drawn sword, even at dead of night, he awaited the hour when the 
next contestant would appear, break off a twig of the Oak, and challenge him 
to mortal combat. 

In recent times, the Arician Grove is notable as the starting-point of James 
Frazer's The Golden Bough (1890), one of the founding works of modern 
anthropology. Frazer ranks alongside Marx, Freud, and Einstein as a pioneer 
who changed the thinking of the world. Frazer posed himself two simple 
questions: 'Why had the priest to slay his predecessor?' and 'Why, before he 
slew him, had he first to pluck the Golden Bough?' 1 

In search of possible answers, he set off on an investigation of 
supernatural beliefs in every conceivable culture, ancient or modern. He 
examines rain-making in China; priest-kings from the Pharaohs to Dalai 
Lama; tree-spirits from New Guinea to the Cedar of Gilgit, corn-spirits from 
the Isle of Skye to the Gardens of Adonis; May-Day festivals, summer Fire 
Festivals, and harvest Festivals. He describes belief in the internal Soul 
among the Hawaiians and in the external Soul among the Samoyeds of 
Siberia: in the transference of evil and the expulsion of spirits. He outlines a 
great range of sacrificial ceremonies from sacrifices among the Khonds of 
Bengal, to 'eating the God' in Lithuania and 'crying the neck' by the reapers 
of Devon. 

Frazer was making two assumptions, which in his own day were 
revolutionary. On one hand, he insisted that so-called 'primitive' or 'savage' 
practices were based on serious ideas, and hence, despite their grotesque 
appearances, were worthy of respect. At the same time, he showed that the 
supposedly advanced religions of the civilized world, including Christianity, 
owed much to their pagan predecessors. 'The life of the old kings and priests 
teems with instruction' he wrote. 'In it, was summed up all that passed for 
wisdom when the world was young'. 2 Or again: 

Our resemblances to the savage are still far more numerous than our 
differences.... We are like heirs to a fortune which has been handed down 



for so many ages that the memory of those who built it up has been lost... . 
Their errors were not wilful extravagances or the ravings of insanity.... We 
shall do well to look with leniency upon their errors as inevitable slips made 
in the search for truth and to give them the benefit for that indulgence which 
we may one day stand in need of ourselves: cum exclusione itaque veteres 
audiendi sunt. 3 

Frazer's universal tolerance was one of the principal means whereby the 
European humanities were able to escape from their narrow Christian strait- 
jacket, and open themselves up to all times and all peoples. His 
demonstration that many of the customs of Christian peoples had their roots 
in pagan practices was particularly shocking: 

At the approach of Easter, Sicilian women sow wheat, lentils and canary- 
seed in plates which are kept in the dark and watered... The plants soon 
shoot up: the stalks are tied together with red ribbons and the plates 
containing them are placed on the sepulchres which with effigies of the dead 
Christ, are made up in ... churches on Good Friday.... The whole custom- 
sepulchres as well as plates of sprouting grain-is probably nothing but a 
continuation, under another name, of Adonis worship. 4 

Returning to the Arician Grove, Frazer concluded that the King of the 
Grove personified the tree with the Golden Bough, and that the rite of his 
death had parallels among many European peoples from Gaul to Norway. 
The Golden Bough, he claimed, was none other than the mistletoe, whose 
name he derived from the Welsh, meaning 'tree of pure gold'. 'The King of 
the Wood lived and died as an incarnation of the supreme Aryan God, whose 
life was in the mistletoe or Golden Bough.' 5 

To be safe, he added a final paragraph saying that nowadays the visitor to 
Nemi's woods can hear the church bells of Rome 'which chime out from the 
distant city, and die lingeringly away across the wide Campagnan 
marshes.... le Roi est mort, vzve le roU ,G In other words, the pagan King of 
the Grove has gone; the Christian 'King of Heaven' reigns supreme. He 
didn't care to mention that the Christian King, too, was born to be slain. 


The growing population of Rome was fed on state-supplied corn, the frumen- 
tum publicum, which was imported initially from Latium and later from Sicily 




and North Africa. But the Romans were also wedded to luxuries, and were able 
to pay for them. The 'silk route' was opened to China, and the 'spice lanes' to 
India. Roman traders, the notorious negotiators, moved freely round the Empire 
after the armies, taking valuables, styles, and expectations with them, [samos] 

A common currency was introduced in Italy in 269 bc and in Roman territories 
as a whole in 49 bc. In the imperial period there were gold, silver, brass, and 
copper coins. The brass sestertius became the basic unit of currency. The gold 
aureus was worth 100s., the silver denarius 4, the copper as one quarter. Local 
currencies continued alongside, however, and the right to mint was an important 
mark of status, [nomisma] 


CEDROS 

The fact that the Greeks and Romans had only one word-either kedros or 
cedros -to describe the two different species of juniper and cedar merits a 
nine-page appendix. On the scale of scholarship demanded by a genuine 
specialist, a subject such as Trees and Timber in the Ancient Mediterranean 
World needs a volume as large as the one you are reading. 1 

And it is worth every page. It shows what a dedicated scholar can do by 
applying a very narrow instrument to a very broad front-in other words, if 
one is permitted the only appropriate metaphor, to saw a cross-section 
through the trunk of the classical world. Like other such works, it starts with 
a meticulous examination of the different sources of evidence: archaeology, 
literary references, inscriptions, temple commissioners' accounts and reports, 
dendrochronology. It then surveys the subject-matter-from the cedar 
floorbeams at Cnossos to the ash spear of Achilles, from the 220 Roman 
ships built in 45 days for the Lirst Punic War to the bridge over the Rhine 
built in ten days for Julius Caesar. 

Greece and Rome were not timber-based civilizations, like those of the 
far north. [Novgorod] But their knowledge of timber was renowned, and the 
timber trade well developed. After reading up on the subject, one can never 
see a fir tree without thinking of the Athenian fleet at Salamis, nor pass a 




larch without imagining the 100-foot mast of a Roman trireme. Every bare 
hillside is a reminder of the Romans' deforestation of southern Italy and of 
northern Africa, [eco] 

History demands sympathetic historians. There has never been a finer 
dovetail than that which joined classical trees and timber to the son of a 
timber merchant from New York State. 


SAMOS 

S amian ware, the everyday 'red-gloss pottery' of the Roman Empire, 
probably originated on the island of Samos, but the great mass of it was not 
manufactured there. From an important factory at Arretium (Arezzo), which 
was most active ad 30-40, its production was moved to a number of large- 
scale potteries in Gaul. Forty-five main centres are known; but the major 
ones from the first century were located at sites at La Graufesenque 
(Aveyron) and Banassac (Lozere), from the second century at Les Martres de 
Veyre and Lezoux (Puy-de-Dome), and from the third century at Trier and at 
Tabernae Rhenanae (Rheinzabern) in Germany. The full geographical range 
stretches from Spain and North Africa to Colchester and Upchurch in 
England and Westerndorff on the River Inn in Austria. 1 

Ceramology seeks the triumph of ingenuity and pedantry over the 
remains of millions of archaeologists' pots and shards; and Samian ware has 
offered the most extensive challenge. Since studies began in 1879, over 160 
kilns have been identified, together with over 3,000 individual potters' 
marks. Hans Dragendorff (1895) classified 55 standard forms of vessel (Dl- 
D55). Others have catalogued standard decorative motifs, analysed technical 
aspects such as the gloss, the clay, and the texture of the terra sigillata, or 
established the colour spectrum from the characteristic orange-pink of 
Banassac to the deep orange-brown of Les Martres de Veyre. Pioneer 
collections at the British Museum and the , Musee Carnavalet led the way 
for numerous studies from Toronto to Ljubljana. 2 

Potters' marks are specially revealing. Often preceded by the letter f(= 




fecit, made by), m (= manu, by the hand of), or of {-officinal, by the factory 
of), they bring to life the craftsmen who fed the most widespread commodity 
of imperial trade. The working lives of 51 central Gaulish potters have been 
exactly charted. Cocatus Idenalis and Ranto worked throughout the reign of 
Trajan (98-117); Cinnamus of Lezoux was active c.150-90; Banuus, 
Casurius, and Divixtus spanned the five reigns from Antoninus Pius (138- 
61) to Albinus (193-7). 3 

The net result is a corpus of information that is so sophisticated that the 
date and provenance of the smallest fragment of Samian ware can be 
precisely established. For archaeologists, it is a research aid of inestimable 
value. A crate of Samian ware from Gaul was found, unopened, at Pompeii. 
Similar consignments were sent to every town and settlement of the Empire. 


Roman society was built on fundamental legal distinctions between the citizen 
and the non-citizen and, among the non-citizens, between the free and the 
unfree. It was a strict system of hereditary social 'orders' or estates. Practices 
which began in ancient Latium were modified over the centuries until they 
encompassed the vast and variegated populations of all the Empire's provinces. 
In early republican Rome, the patres or city fathers were set apart from the plebs 
or common people, with whom they were forbidden to intermarry. The patrician 
clans dominated both the political life of the city in the Senate and economic life 
through their hold on the distribution of land; and they fought a long rearguard 
action against the plebeian challenge. But eventually their privileges were 
undermined. In 296 bc, by the Lex Ogulnia, the plebs were to be admitted to the 
sacred colleges of pontifices and augurs. In 287 bc, by the Lex Hortensia, the 
laws of the plebeian assembly became binding on all citizens. The plebs had 
become part of the Establishment. In the so-called 'Social War' of 90-89 bc, 
Rome's Italian allies successfully claimed the rights of full citizenship. But it 
was not until ad 212 that the Constitutio Antoniniana gave citizenship to all free¬ 
born male subjects of the Empire. 

Important distinctions developed within the patrician oligarchy of the later 
Republic. A handful of the most ancient and senior clans, the gentes maiores, 
formed an aristocracy among the patricians-the Valerii, Fabii, Cornelii, Claudii, 
and others. The nobiles were a wider but still senatorial group, consisting of all 
who could claim descent from a consul. They possessed the highly valued right 




of displaying in public the waxen portraits of their ancestors. The equites or 
'knights' formed a sub-senatorial propertied class which possessed the means to 
belong to the cavalry. They had the right to wear a toga edged with two thin 
purple stripes, the angusticlavia, as opposed to the senator's toga with broad 
purple stripes, the latidavia. In the theatre, they sat in the first fourteen rows, 
immediately behind the orchestra, reserved for senators. They were the chief 
beneficiaries of promotions under Augustus, when they largely displaced the 
nobiles as the backbone of the ruling class. 

The strong contrast between city and countryside persisted. Like Rome itself, 
the provincial cities developed into major urban centres, characterized by 
imposing public works-paved streets, aqueducts, baths, theatres, temples, 
monuments-and by the growth of merchant, artisan, and proletarian classes. 
The city mob-constantly pacified, in Juvenal's words, 'through bread and 
circuses', panem et circenses, became a vital social factor. In the countryside, the 
villas of local dignitaries stood out above the toiling mass of slaves who worked 
the great latifundia. An intermediate and, in the nature of things, enterprising 
group of lib-ertini or 'freed slaves' grew in importance, as the import of fresh 

slave populations tailed off with the end of the Republic's conquests, 
[SPARTACUS] 

Despite the extreme contrasts of Roman society-between the vast power 
and wealth of the patricians and the lot of their slaves, between the opulence of 
many city-dwellers and the backwardness of the desert tribes and barbarian 
settlers on the periphery-it is a tribute to the flexible paternalism of the Roman 
social tradition that the outbreaks of class conflict were relatively few and far 
between. Blood relations carried great weight in Rome, where elaborate kinship 
groups proliferated. The patriciate presided over society at large just as the 
paterfamilias presided over every extended family. The patricians were 
originally divided into three tribes; the tribes into thirty curiae or parishes; and 
the parishes into gentes or clans and families. In later times the gens was 
composed of persons boasting the same remote male ancestor, whilst the familia 
was narrowed to mean 'household group'. The absolute rights of fathers over all 
members of their family, the patria potestas was one of the corner-stones of 
family law. [nomen] 


SPARTACUS 




Spartacus (d. 71 BC) was a gladiator, and the leader of the ancient world's 
most extensive slave uprising. A Thracian by birth, he had served in the 
Roman army before deserting and being sold into slavery to the gladiatorial 
school in Capua. In 73 bc, he broke out, and with a band of fellow fugitives 
set up camp on Mount Vesuvius. For the next two years he defied all 
attempts to catch him. His army swelled to almost 100,000 desperate men, 
who marched the length and breadth of Italy, to the Alps and the straits of 
Messina. In 72 bc he defeated each of the reigning consuls in turn in pitched 
battles. He was finally cornered at Petelia in Lucania, separated from his 
Gallic and German allies, and annihilated by the forces of the praetor, M. 
Licinius Crassus. Spartacus died sword in hand, having first killed his horse 
to render further flight impossible. 1 

Appropriately enough, Crassus was one of the wealthiest slave-owners in 
Rome. He had benefited from the estates sequestered from the faction of 
Marius, and grew vastly rich by training his slaves in lucrative trades and by 
mining silver. Known as 'Dives', he was Consul in 70 with Pompey, and 
triumvir with Pompey and Caesar in 60. He celebrated his victory over 
Spartacus by lining 120 miles of the road from Capua to Rome with 
crucified prisoners, and by treating the Roman populace to a banquet of ten 
thousand tables. He enriched himself further as Governor of Syria, only to be 
killed in 53 bc by the Parthians. His head was cut off, the mouth stuffed with 
molten gold. The accompanying notice from the Parthian king read: 'Gorge 
yourself in death with the metal you so craved in life.' 

Slavery was omnipresent in Roman society, and in some estimations the 
key institution of the economy. It provided the manpower for agriculture and 
industry, and underpinned the luxury of the cities. It involved the total 
physical, economic, and sexual exploitation of the slaves and their children. 
It was supported by the wars of the Republic, which brought in millions of 
captives, and in later centuries by systematic slave-raiding and slave-trading. 
Julius Caesar sold off 53,000 Gallic prisoners after one battle alone, at 
Atuatia (Namur). The island of Delos served as the principal entrepot for 
barbarians brought from the East, and from beyond the Danube. 

Slavery continued to be a feature of European life long after Roman 
times-as it was in most other cultures. It persisted throughout medieval 
Christendom, though it was gradually overtaken by the institution of 
serfdom. It was generally permitted among Christians so long as the slaves 



themselves were not Christian. It was still common enough in Renaissance 
Italy, where Muslim slaves were treated much as in their countries of origin. 
In more modern times, the European powers only tolerated it in their 
overseas colonies, where it survived the conversion of the slaves to 
Christianity. 

The abolition of slavery was one of the chief social products of the 
European Enlightenment. It progressed through three main stages. The 
outlawry of slave-owning in the home countries was followed by the 
suppression of the international slave trade and then of slave-owning in the 
overseas colonies. In Britain's case, these stages were reached in 1772, 1807, 
and 1833. Abolition did not occur, however, through revolts such as that of 
Spartacus. It occurred, as Emerson remarked, 'through the repentance of the 
tyrant'. 2 

In modern times, Spartacus was adopted as a historical hero by the 
communist movement. His name was borrowed by the forerunner of the 
KPD, the Spartakusbund of 1916-19; and it was used by Arthur Koestler for 
the protagonist of his novel The Gladiators (1939). Slave revolts, in the 
Marxist view, were a necessary feature of ancient society, and were given 
suitable prominence in communist textbooks. A partner for Spartacus was 
found in Saumacus, leader of an earlier revolt among the Scythian slaves of 
Crimea, i.e. on 'Soviet territory'. Soviet historians did not care to emphasize 
the parallels between the world of Spartacus and Crassus and that of the 
Gulag, forced collectivization, and the nomenklatura. 3 [chersonesos] 


There was a profusion of popular assemblies in Rome, which had both social 
and political functions. The patricians met on their own in the comitia curiata, 
their 'parish meetings', where, among other things, they ratified the appointment 
of the consuls. The plebeians, too, met regularly in the comitia tributa or 'tribal 
meetings', where they discussed their communal affairs and elected their 
officials-the tribunes, or 'spokesmen of the tribes', the quaestores and the 
aediles the plebeian magistrates. After 449 bc they could be summoned by the 
consuls as well as by the tribunes. They met in the Forum; and in the plebiscita, 
or 'voting of the plebs', they gave their opinion on any matter put to them. 

For military purposes, patricians and plebeians met together in the comitia 
cen-turiata or the 'meetings of the centuries'. They assembled outside the city, 




on the vast Campus Martius, the Field of Mars, where they were drawn up in 
their thirty-five tribes. Each tribe was divided according to wealth into five 
classes, with the equites or 'knights of the cavalry' at the top and the poorest of 
the pedites or 'infantry' at the bottom. In time, there was also an unpropertied 
class of proletarii or 'proles'. Each of the classes was organized in turn into 
centuriae or 'centuries', and each century into 'seniors' (men aged between 45- 
GO, on the reserve list) and 'juniors' (men aged between 17-45, liable for active 
service). The census of 241 bc showed a total of 260,000 citizens in 373 
centuries, which works out at almost 700 men per century. Here was the whole 
of Roman (male) society in full view. These comitia centuriata gradually 
assumed the functions once reserved for the patricians, including the elections of 
the chief magistrates, the conferment of the imperium or 'right of command' on 
military leaders, the ratification of laws, and decisions of war and peace. They 
voted by dropping clay tablets into one of two baskets as they filed out of their 
century enclosures. Their proceedings were required to be completed within one 
day. 


NOMEN 

Clan and family provided the basis for the Roman system of personal 
names. All patrician males had three names. The praenomen or forename 
was generally chosen from a shortlist of twelve, usually written in 
abbreviated form: 

C(G) = Gaius, Gn = Gnaeus, D = Decimus, FI = Flavius, L = Lucius, 

M = Marcus, N = Numerius, P = Publius, Q = Ouintus, R = Rufus, S 
= Sextus, T = Titus 

The nomen indicated a man's clan, the cognomen his family. Hence 'C. 
Julius Caesar' stood for Gaius, from the gens or clan of the Julii, and the 
domus or family of Caesar. 

All men belonging to the same patrician clan shared the same nomen, 
whilst all their paternal male kin shared both nomen and cognomen. At any 
one time, therefore, there were several 'Julius Caesars' in circulation, each 
distinguished by his praenomen. The famous general's father was L. lulius 




Caesar. When several members of the same family had all three names in 
common, they were differentiated by additional epithets: 

P. Cornelius Scipio, tribune 396-395 BC 
P. Cornelius Scipio Barbatus ('the Beard'), dictator 306 
P. Cornelius Scipio Asina ('the She-Ass'), consul 221 
P. Cornelius Scipio, consul 218; father of Africanus 

P. Cornelius Scipio Africanus Maior ('the Elder African' 236-184), 
general, consul 205,194, victor over Hannibal 

L. Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus ('the Asian'); brother of Africanus 

P. Cornelius Scipio Africanus Minor ('the Younger African'); son of 
Africanus Maior 

P. Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus Africanus Minor Numantinus ('the 
Numantian', 184-129 BC); adopted son of Africanus Minor, 
destroyer of Carthage 

P. Cornelius Scipio Nasica ('the Nose'), consul 191 

P. Cornelius Scipio Corculum ('Little Heart'), pontifex maximus 150 

Plebeians, like G. Marius or M. Antonius, possessed no nomen. 

Women, in contrast, were given only one name-either the feminine 
nomen of the clan for patricians or the feminine cognomen of the family for 
plebeians. Hence all the daughters of the Julii were called 'Julia', or of the 
Livii 'Livia'. Sisters were not differentiated. The two daughters of Mark 
Antony were both called 'Antonia'. One became the mother of German-icus, 
the other the grandmother of Nero. All the daughters of Marius were called 
'Maria'. It is a sign of Roman women'slowly standing that they were denied 
a full individual identity. 1 

As Roman practice shows, multiple names were only required by 
citizens with independent legal status. For much of European history, 
therefore, most people made do with much less. All they had was a 
forename, or 'Christian name', together with a patronymic or adjectival 
description. All the languages of Europe had their counterparts for 'Little 
John, son of Big Tom'. In addition to a personal name, women often used a 
term denoting whose wife or daughter they were. In the Slavonic world, this 
took the form of the suffixes -ova or -ovna. 'Maria Stefanowa' (Polish) stood 



for 'Stephen's wife, Mary'; 'Elena Borisovna' (Russian) for 'Helen, daughter 
of Boris'. Well-known people and foreigners often acquired names 
indicating their place of origin. 

In the Middle Ages, the feudal nobility needed to associate themselves 
with the fief or landed property which justified their rank. As a result, they 
adopted place-based surnames using either a prefix, such as von, or di, or 
suffix, such as -ski. Hence, the French prince Charles de Lorraine would be 
known in German as 'Karl von Lotharingen' or in Polish as 'Karol 
Lotarinski'. Members of guilds adopted names denoting their craft or trade. 
The ubiquitous Bakers, Carters, Millers, and Smiths belonged to the largest 
group to fix on the custom of family surnames. More recently, state 
governments have turned custom into a legal requirement, bringing 
individuals into the net of censuses, tax-collecting, and conscription. 2 

The Gaels of Scotland and the Jews of Poland were two ancient 
communities who long escaped surnames. Both had enjoyed communal 
autonomy, surviving for centuries with traditional name forms using either 
patronymics (such as the Jewish 'Abraham Ben Isaac', i.e. Abraham, son of 
Isaac) or personal epithets. The famous Highland outlaw, whom the English- 
speaking Lowlanders called Rob Roy MacGregor, c.1660-1732, was known 
to his own as Rob Ruadh (Red Robert) of Inversnaid. Both the Gaelic and 
the Jewish nomenclatures fell victim to state bureaucracies in the late 
eighteenth century. After the Jacobite defeat, the Scottish Highlanders were 
registered according to clan names which they had previously rarely used, 
thereby giving rise to thousands upon thousands of MacGregors, 
MacDonalds, and MacLeods. After the Partitions of Poland, Polish Jews in 
Russia usually took the names of their home towns or of their noble 
employers. In Prussia and Austria they were allotted German surnames by 
state officials. From 1795 to 1806, the Jewish community of Warsaw found 
itself at the mercy of E. T. A. Hoffmann, then chief Prussian administrator of 
the city, who handed out surnames according to his fancy. The lucky ones 
came away with Apfelbaum, Himmelfarb, or Vogelsang: the less fortunate 
with Fischbein, Hosenduft, or Katzenellenbogen. 3 


Within these assemblies, patronage groups played a vital role. In a 
hierarchical and highly compartmentalized society it was natural, indeed 




essential, for wealthy patricians to manipulate the activities of the lower orders 
and thereby to influence the decisions of popular institutions. To this end each 
patronus retained a following of dependent clientes. The patron expected his 
followers to support his policies and his preferred candidates. The clients 
expected a reward of money, office, or property. Serving a wealthy patron was 
the best road to social advancement. It was patronage that gave Roman 
government its characteristic blend of democratic forms and oligarchic control. 

The network of assemblies, the rotation of offices, and the need for frequent 
meetings created a strong sense of belonging. Every Roman citizen knew exactly 
where he stood with regard to his tribe, his clan, his family, his century, and his 
patron. Participation and service were part of the accepted ethos. In formal 
terms, it was the popular assemblies which appointed the chief officials, and the 
officials who appointed the Senate. In reality, it was the senators who made all 
other institutions function to their advantage. Whoever dominated the Senate 
ruled the Republic. 

The Senate, which held centre stage under both Republic and Empire, had a 
membership which fluctuated between 300 and 600 men. Its members were 
appointed by the consuls, whom it was called on to advise. But since the consuls 
were required to give preference to 'experienced men', and since senatorial 
patrons controlled all the major offices of state, the Senate could blithely 
perpetuate its hold on government. It was the core of a self-perpetuating elite. 
The dominant element within the Senate at any particular moment depended on 
the delicate balance of power between competing individuals, clans, and 
clientelae or 'client groups'. But the same patrician names are repeated over and 
over through the centuries, until a tidal wave of upstarts finally swept them 
away. 

With time, the efficiency of senatorial control declined in proportion to the 
growth of factionalism. When the Senate was paralysed through civil strife, the 
only ways to keep the system running were either for a dictator to be installed by 
common consent or for one faction to impose its will through force of arms. This 
was the source of the string of dictators in the first century bc. In the end, the 
faction led by Octavian Caesar, the future 'Augustus', imposed its will on all the 
others. Octavian became the patron of patrons, holding the fate of all the 
senators in his hands. 

The two consuls, the joint chief executives of Rome, held office for one year 
from 1 January. In its origins, their office was essentially a military one. They 



were proposed by the Senate and appointed by the comitia centuriata, which 
gave them the imperium or 'army command' for specific tasks. But they 
gradually assumed additional functions. They presided over the Senate, and, in 
conjunction with the Senate, held responsibility for foreign affairs. They 
supervised the management of the city's internal affairs under the praetores, the 
'chief judges' who ran the judicial system, the censores, who controlled taxation 
and the registration of citizens, the quaestores, who ran public finance, the 
aediles, who policed the city and ran the Games, and the pontifex, the high 
priest. In conjunction with the tribunes, they were expected to keep the peace 
between the Senate and the people. It is a measure of the consuls' importance 
that Romans kept the historical record of the city, not in terms of numbered 
years, but in terms of the consulships, [auc] 

Thanks to the reforms of Marius and Sulla, the profile of the consulship 
changed. The practice of administering the provinces through proconsules, or 
consular deputies, extended its range of powers. On the other hand, direct 
control of the army was lost. 

Roman government seems to be the subject of many misconceptions. It was in 
constant flux over a very long period of time, and did not attain any great 
measure of homogeneity, except, perhaps, briefly in the age of the Antonines. Its 
undoubted success was due to the limited but clearly defined goals that were set. 
It provided magistrates to settle disputes and to exact tribute. It provided an army 
for external defence, law enforcement, and internal security. And it supported the 
authority of approved local or regional elites, often through their participation in 
religious rites and civic ceremonies. The magic combination involved both great 
circumspection, in the degree of the state's encroachment on established rights 
and privileges, and utter mercilessness, in defending lawful authority. In Virgil's 
words: 

Tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento 
(hae tibi erunt artes), pacisque imponere morem 
parcere subiectis et debellare superbos. 

(Make it your task, Roman, to rule the peoples by your command; and these are 
your skills: to impose the habit of peace, to spare those who submit, and to 
conquer the proud.)- 

Yet Roman institutions seen through modern concepts can be deceptive. 


Under the Roman kingdom the monarchy was not hereditary, and it was limited 
by the Senate of the patricians which eventually overthrew it. Under the early 
Republic the two consuls, elected annually by the patrician Senate, received the 
full 'power to command'. But they were closely constrained both by the dual 
nature of the office and by the right of veto established in 494 by the tribunes of 
the plebs. Hence the famous formula of SPQR- Senatus Populusque Romanus y 
'the Senate and People of Rome'-in whose name all authority was exercised. 
Under the late Republic and early Empire, most of the traditional magistracies 
and legislative bodies survived; but they were subordinated to the increasingly 
dictatorial pretensions of the executive. 

Roman political culture determined how changing institutions actually 
worked. Political and religious life were always closely interwoven. The reading 
of the auguries accompanied all decision-making. Strong emphasis was placed 
on family or local authority. As a result, civic responsibility, the demands of 
military service, and respect for the law were deeply ingrained. Rotating offices 
demanded a high degree of lobbying and initiative. Under the Republic 
consensus was always sought through the taking of consilium (advice). Under 
the Principate (or early Empire), it was obedience that counted. 

Roman law has been described as the Romans' 'most enduring contribution 
to world history'.- Its career began with the Twelve Tables of 451-50 bc, which 
were thenceforth regarded as the fount of 'equal law', the ideas that were equally 
binding on all citizens. It distinguished two main components, the ius civile 
(state law) regulating the relations between citizens, and the ius gentium 
(international law). It developed through the agglomeration of accepted custom 
and practice, as determined by prudenda or 'legal method'. Over the years every 
point of law was tested, amended, or expanded. The praetors were the main 
source of this type of law-making until the 'Perpetual Edict' of the Emperor 
Hadrian put a stop to further amendments. Laws initiated by magistrates, the 
leges rogatae, were differentiated from the plebiscita or 'popular judgements' 
initiated by one or other of the assemblies. 

The complexity and antiquity of legal practice inevitably gave rise to the 
science of jurisprudence, and to the long line of Roman jurists from Q. Mucius 
Scaevola (Consul in 95 bc) onwards. It was a sign of deteriorating times that two 
of the greatest jurists, Aemilius Papinianus (Papinian, d. 213), a Greek, and 
Domitius Ulpianus (Ulpian, d. 223), were both put to death, [lex] 


The Roman army was the product of a society nurtured in perpetual warfare. Its 
logistical support system was as remarkable as its technical skills and its 
corporate ethos. For half a millennium, from the Second Punic War to the 
disasters of the third century, it was virtually invincible. Its victories were 
endless, each marked by the pomp of a Triumph and by a vast collection of 
monuments on the model of Titus' Arch or Trajan's Column. Its defeats were all 
the more shocking for being exceptional. The annihilation of three Roman 
legions in the German backwoods in ad 9 was a sensation unparalleled until the 
death of the Emperor Decius in battle against the Goths in 251, or the capture of 
the Emperor Valerian by the Persians in 260. The Latin proverb si vis pacem, 
para bellum, 'if you want peace, prepare for war', summarized a way of life. 

[HERMANN] 


LEX 

It is often said that Roman law is one of the pillars of European civilization. 
And so, indeed, it is. Latin lex means 'the bond', 'that which binds'. The 
same idea underlies that other keystone of Roman legality, the pactum or 
'contract'. Once freely agreed by two parties, whether for commercial, 
matrimonial, or political purposes, the conditions of the contract bind the 
parties to observe it. As the Romans knew, the rule of law ensures sound 
government, commercial confidence, and orderly society. 

Yet it must not be imagined that the legal traditions of Rome were 
bequeathed to modern Europe by any simple line of direct inheritance. Most 
of the Empire's law codes fell into disuse with the disintegration of the 
Empire, and had to be rediscovered in the Middle Ages (see Chapter V). 
They survived longest in Byzantium, but did not by that route strongly 
influence modern law-making. Indeed, in terms of direct example, they 
probably most immediately affected the formulation of Catholic canon law. 

What is more, even in the secular sphere the revival of Roman traditions 
had to compete with other non-Roman, and often contradictory, legal 
practices. Rome was only one of several sources of European jurisprudence. 
Customary law, in all its diversity, was equally important. In some countries, 
such as France, a balance was achieved between Roman and customary 




traditions. In most of Germany, the Roman law arrived in the fifteenth 
century, at a very late date. In England, exceptionally, the common law, 
modified by the principles of equity, was to gain a virtual monopoly. 

Even so, the Roman distinction between the public and the private 
domains was to suit the purposes of Europe's growing polities; and civil law 
in most European countries was to be based on codified principles in the 
Roman fashion (as opposed to the Anglo-American concept of legal 
precedent). In this regard, the single most influential institution came to be 
the French Code Napoleon (1804). 

Whatever their connections, all educated European lawyers acknowledge 
their debt to Cicero and to Cicero's successors. It was Cicero, in De legibus, 
who wrote: Salus populi suprema lex, 'the safety of the people is the highest 
law'. 1 One could equally say that the rule of law provides the people with 
the highest degree of safety. 


During the Pox Romana, the Empire's fortresses and frontiers were 
maintained by a standing force of some thirty legions. Many legions became 
closely associated with the provinces in which they were permanently stationed 
for generations, or even for centuries-the 'II Augusta' and the 'XX Valeria 
Victrix' in Britain, the 'XV Apollinaris' in Pannonia, or the 'V Macedonica' in 
Moesia. 

Each legion counted c.5-6,000 men, and was commanded by a senator. It 
consisted of three lines of infantry-the hastati, principes, and triarii, each made 
up of ten maniples commanded by a 'prior' and a 'posterior' centurion; a body of 
velites or 'skirmishers'; the iustus equitatus or 'complement of cavalry', 
consisting of ten turmae or 'squadrons'; and a train of engineers. In addition, 
there were a large number of auxiliary regiments made up of allies and 
mercenaries, each organized in a separate cohort under its own prefect. 

With time, the percentage of citizen-soldiers declined disastrously; but the 
backbone of the system continued to rest on the middle-ranking Roman officer 
caste, who served as centurions. Distinguished service was rewarded with 
medals, or with crowns for the generals; and loyal veterans could expect a grant 
of land in one of the military colonies. Discipline was maintained by fierce 
punishments, including flogging and (for turncoats) crucifixion. In later times, 




the decline of civilian institutions gave the military their chance to dominate 
imperial politics. The gladius or 'thrusting sword', first adopted from the 
Iberians during the Second Punic War, became, in the hands of the gladiators, the 
symbol of Rome's pleasures as well as her invincibility. 

Roman architecture had a strong proclivity for the utilitarian. Its achievements 
belong more to the realm of engineering than to design. Although the Greek 
tradition of temple-building was continued, the most innovative features were 
concerned with roads and bridges, with urban planning and with secular, 
functional buildings. The Romans, unlike the Greeks, mastered the problem of 
the arch and the vault, using them as the basis for bridges and for roofs. The 
triumphal arch, therefore, which adorned almost all Roman cities combined both 
the technical mastery and the ethos of Roman building. The Pantheon, first built 
by Agrippa in 27 bc in honour of'all the gods' and the Battle of Actium, carries a 
vaulted dome that is 4 ft 6 in (1.5 m) wider than St Peter's. (It is now the Church 
of Santa Maria Rotunda ad Martyres.) The Colosseum (80 ad), more correctly 
the Flavian Amphitheatre, is a marvellous amalgam of Greek and Roman 
features, and has four tiers of arches interspersed with columns. It seated 87,000 
spectators. The vast brick-built Baths of Caracalla or Thermae Antoninianae (ad 
217)-where Shelley composed his Prometheus Unbound -are a monument to 
the Roman lifestyle, 360 yards (330 m) square. They contained the usual 
sections graded by temperature -the frigidarium, tepidarium, and caldarium, a 
piscina or pool for 1,600 bathers, a stadium, Greek and Latin libraries, a picture 
gallery, and assembly rooms. The Baths of Diocletian (ad 306) were even more 
sumptuous. The grandiose Circus Maximus was devoted to chariot-racing; it was 
enlarged until it could accommodate 385,000 spectators, [epigraph] 

Roman literature is all the more attractive for challenging the prevailing ethos of 
a military and, to a large extent, a philistine society. The Roman literati 
obviously had their clientele, especially among the leisured aristocracy of late 
Republican and early imperial Rome. But somehow they did not blend into the 
landscape so naturally as their Greek counterparts. There was always tension 
between the sophisticated world of letters and the stern Roman world at large. 
This tension may well explain why Latin literature developed so late, and why it 
received such a hostile reception from those who, like Cato, saw it as a mere 
aping of decadent Greek habits. It may also explain why dramatic comedy was 
the first genre to be imported, and why satire was the only medium which the 



Romans could honestly call their own. Of the thirty or so masters of the Latin 
repertoire, Virgil, Horace, Ovid, and Cicero have gained universal recognition. 
But anyone who recoils from the luxury, gluttony, and cruelty of Roman living 
must surely feel an affinity for the sensitive souls who reacted most strongly 
against their milieu- for the exquisite lyrics of Catullus, the biting wit of 
Juvenal, the epigrams of Martial. 


EPIGRAPH 

Epigraphy, the study of inscriptions, is one of the important auxiliary 
sciences in exploring the classical world. Since so much material and 
cultural evidence has perished, the inscriptions which have survived on stone 
or on metal provide an invaluable source of information. The careful study 
of tombstones, dedicatory tablets, statues, public monuments, and the like 
yields a rich harvest of intimate details about the people whom the 
inscriptions commemorate-their family life, their names and titles, their 
writing, their careers, their regiments, their laws, their gods, their morality. 
The great epigraphic collections, such as the Corpus Inscriptionum 
Latinarum (CIL) and the Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum (CIG), both 
produced in nineteenth-century Berlin, are as solid and as durable as the 
monuments which they record. 

The most famous of Roman epigraphs-the Twelve Tables of the Law, 
which stood for centuries in the Forum-did not survive; but the variety of 
the extant material is extraordinary. 

Roman tombstones frequently bore a poetic description of the dead 
person's life and career. A stone from Moguntium (Mainz) carried a protest 
over the manner of the dedicatee's death: 

Jucundus M Terenti l(ibertus) pecuarius 
Praeteriens quicumque legis consiste viator 
Et vide quam indigne raptus inane queror. 

Vivere non potui plures XXX per annos 
Nam erupuit servus mihi vitam et ipse 
Praecipitem sese dejecit in amnem: 




Apstulit huic Moenus quod domino eripuit. 

Patronus de suo posuit. 1 

(Jucundus, shepherd, a free slave of Marcus Terentius. Traveller, whoever 
you are, stop and peruse these lines. Learn how my life was wrongly taken 
from me, and listen to my vain laments. I was not able to live for more than 
30 years. A slave took my life, then threw himself in the river. The Man took 
his life, of which his master was deprived. (My) patron has raised (this 
stone) at his own expense.) 

Dedications to the gods were a usual feature of public monuments. An 
inscription discovered in the Circus Maximus, and now placed on an obelisk 
in the Piazza del Popolo, was originally erected in 10-9 BC by the Emperor 
Augustus in honour of the conquest of Egypt: 

IMP . CAESAR . DIVI. F 
AUGUSTUS 
PONTIFEX . MAXIMUS 
IMP XII. COS XI. TRIB POT XIV 
AEGYPTO. IN POTESTATEM 
POPULI ROMANI REDACTA 
SOLI. DONUM . DEDIT. 2 

(The Emperor Caesar Augustus, son of the divine (Julius), Supreme Priest, 
twelve times Commander, eleven times Consul, fourteen times Tribune, 
Egypt having passed to the control of the Roman people, has offered this gift 
to the Sun.) 

Objects of a much more humble nature often bear interesting 
inscriptions. Vases and pottery carried marks of manufacture. Metal stamps, 
for imprinting a name or advertisement onto clay, were in common use. A 
whole series of such stamps, from the bottles of an optician, were found at 
Reims: 

D CALLISEST FRAGIS ADASPRITVDI 

D(ecimi) Gall Sest(i) [s] frag(is) ad aspritudi(nem) 
(Decimus Gallius Sestus' Eye-Wash for Granulous 
Pupils) 3 



The first Roman writers wrote in Greek. Livius Andronicus (c.284-204), 
who translated Homer into Latin verse, was an educated Greek slave brought to 
Rome after the sack of Tarentum in 272 bc. Serious Latin literature appeared in 
the second half of the third century bc, with the plays of Cn. Naevius (d. c.200 
bc), T. Maccius Plautus (c.254-184 bc), and P. Terentius Afer, 'Terence' (b. 185 
bc). All three made brilliant adaptations of the Greek comedies; with them, the 
theatre became a central institution of Roman culture. Native Latin poetry begins 
with Q. Ennius (239-169 bc), a prime literary innovator. He introduced tragedy, 
launched the art of satire, and fashioned the Latin hexameter which provided the 
basic metre of many later poets. 

Oratory held a prominent place in Roman life, as it did in Greece. Its greatest 
practitioner, M. Tullius Cicero (106-43 bc), spoke and wrote in a polished style 
which has been taken ever since as the model for Latin prose. A 'new man', 
Cicero rose to the highest office of consul in 63, only to be banished and, after a 
second spell of political activity, to be proscribed and beheaded. His writings, 
which included moral philosophy and political theory as well as the orations, had 
an immense influence both on Christian and on rationalist thinking. He was a 
champion of the rule of law, and of republican government. His successor, the 
elder Seneca (c.55 bc-cad 37), a rhetorician from Cordoba, compiled a great 
anthology of oratory. 

History writing had much to feed on. Titus Livius, 'Livy' (59 bc-ad 17), 
wrote a history of Rome in 142 books, 35 of which are extant. He idealized the 
Roman Republic, and impresses more by style than by analysis. 'I shall find 
satisfaction, not I trust ignobly,' Livy began, 'by labouring to record the story of 
the greatest nation in the world.' C. Iulius Caesar (100-44 bc) was both the 
supreme maker and recorder of Roman history. His accounts of the Gallic War 
and of the civil war against Pompey are masterpieces of simplicity, once known 
to every European schoolboy. C. Sallustius Crispus or 'Sallust' (86-34 bc) 
followed Caesar both in his political and his literary interests. Cornelius Tacitus 
(ad 55-120) continued the annals of Livy through the first century of the 
Empire, and not with any great enthusiasm for the emperors. His inimitably 
astringent style can also be seen in monographs such as the Germania. 'The 
revolution of the ages may bring round the same calamities,' wrote Gibbon in a 
footnote, 'but the ages may revolve without a Tacitus to describe them.' 2 

The art of biography also flourished. The supreme exponent was C. 
Suetonius Tranquillus (ad c.69-140), sometime secretary of the Emperor 


Hadrian. His racy Lives of the Twelve Caesars is a mine of information and 
entertainment, outshone only by Tacitus' study of his father-in-law Agricola, 
Governor of Britain. 

Latin literature undoubtedly reached its heights with the poets of the 
Augustan Age-Virgil, Horace, and Ovid, the lyricist C. Valerius Catullus (c.84- 
54), the elegiac poet Albius Tibullus (c.55-19 bc), and the aptly named Sextus 
Propertius (c.50-15 bc), whose love poems to the exasperating Cynthia match 
those of Catullus to his Lesbia. 'Cupid is naked', wrote Propertius, 'and does not 
like artifice contrived by beauty.' 

P. Vergilius Maro, 'Virgil' (70-19 bc), created language that rarely palls, even 
with the most mundane of subject-matter. His Eclogues or 'Selections' are 
pastoral poems; his Georgies eulogize farming. The Aeneid, or 'Voyage of 
Aeneas', is an extended allegorical epic which celebrates the Roman debt to 
Homer and to Greece. Recounting the adventures of Aeneas, a survivor of Troy 
and ancestor both of Romulus and of the gens lulia, Virgil provided the mythical 
pedigree with which educated Romans wished to identify. His infinitely precise 
hexameters are not really translatable. They were written at the rate of one line a 
day for ten years, and sing in inimitable tone-serene, sustained, subtle, sad: 

FELIX QUI POTUIT RERUM COGNOSCERE CAUSAS, 

(Happy is he who could learn the causes of things.) 

SED FUGIT INTEREA, FUGIT IRREPARABILE TEMPUS. 

(But meanwhile time is flying, flying beyond recall.) 

OMNIA VINCIT AMOR; ET NOS CEDAMUS AMORI. 

(Love conquers all, so let us yield to Love.) 

ET PENITUS TOTO DIVISOS ORBE BRITANNOS 

(And Britons wholly separated from all the world.) 

SUNT LACRIMAB RERUM ET MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT. 

(There are tears shed for things, and mortality touches the 
mind.)- 

For Dante, Virgil was il maestro di lor che sanno (the master of those who 
know), and 'the fount which spilt such a broad river of words'. For the early 
Christians he was the pagan poet who, in the fourth Eclogue, was thought to 
have forecast the birth of Christ. For the modems he was 'lord of language... 
poet of the poet-satyr ... wielder of the stateliest measure ever moulded by the 
lips of man'. He probably composed his own epitaph, seen at Pozzuoli by 



Petrarch: 

MANTUA ME GENUIT CALABRI RAPUERE: TENET NUNC 
PARTHENOPE. CECINI PASCUA, RURA, DUCES. 

(Mantua bore me; Calabria carried me away; Naples now holds me. I sang of 
pastures, fields, and lords.)- 

Q. Horatius Flaccus, 'Horace' (65-8 bc), Virgil's friend and contemporary, 
was the author of Odes and Satires, Epodes and Epistles. He had studied in 
Athens, commanded a legion, and fought at Philippi before retiring to his Sabine 
farm under the protection of his patron Maecenas. He was a gentle, tolerant soul. 
His Epistle to the Pisos, otherwise the Ars Poetica, was much admired by later 
poets. His Satires were directed at human folly, not evil. His Odes shine with 
translucent clarity, and with curiosa felicitas, a 'marvellous felicity of 
expression': 

DULCE ET DECORUM EST PRO PATRIA MORI. 

(It is sweet and fitting to die for one's country.) 

PARTURIENT MONTES, NASCETUR RIDICULUS MUS. 

(The mountains will give birth, and a silly mouse will be 
bom.) 

ATQUE INTER SILVAS ACADEMI QUAERERE VERUM. 

(And seek for truth even in the groves of Academe.) 

EXEGI MONUMBNTUM AERE PERENNIUS ... NON OMNIS MORIAR. 

(I have created a monument more lasting than bronze... I 
shall not die completely.)- 

Horace is the most imitated, and the most translated of poets. 

P. Ovidius Naso, 'Ovid' (43 BC-17 ad), was a leading figure of Roman 
society until banished to the Black Sea coast by the Emperor Augustus. The 
causes of his exile, he says, were 'a poem and an error'. The poem was 
undoubtedly his Ars amatoria, 'The Art of Love'; the error probably involved 
the Emperor's daughter Julia, who was also banished. Ovid's Metamorphoses or 
'Transformations', which rework over two hundred Greek and Roman myths and 
legends, has been rated the most influential book of the ancient world. It has 
provided the favourite reading not only of the Romans but of people as different 
as Chaucer, Montaigne, and Goethe. It has inspired a torrent of creative works 
from Petrarch to Picasso. Si vis amari, wrote Ovid, ama (If you wish to be loved, 


you, too, must love).- 

The Silver Age of Latin literature, which lasted from the death of Augustus 
to perhaps the middle of the second century, contained fewer giants. Apart from 
Tacitus and Suetonius, there gleamed the talent of the Stoic philosopher Seneca 
II, of the two Plinys, of the poet Lucan, the rhetorician Quintilian, the novelist 
Petronius, and, above all, of the satirist D. Iunius Iuvenalis, 'Juvenal' (c.47-130). 
Difficile est saturam non scribere, wrote Juvenal (it is difficult not to write 
satire). 

The calculated violence of Roman life was proverbial. The butcheries of the 
foreign wars were repeated in the civil strife of the city. Livy's catch-phrase, Vae 
vic-tis! (Woe to the vanquished) was no empty slogan. In 88 bc, when the so- 
called 'Vespers of Ephesus' saw perhaps 100,000 Romans massacred in one day 
on the orders of King Mithridates, Sulla, leader of the aristocratic 'Optimates', 
marched on Rome and proscribed the rival followers of Marius. The head of the 
Tribune, P. Sulpicius Rufus, was exhibited in the Forum. The urban Praetor, 
preparing to conduct a sacrifice before the Temple of Concord, was sacrificed 
himself. In 87 bc, when Rome opened its gates to Marius, it was the turn of the 
Optimates to be slaughtered. Marius' legions of slaves and his Dalmatian Guard 
struck down every senator whom the general did not salute. Among his victims 
were names of later importance-Gn. Octavius, the reigning consul, M. Crassus, 
M. Antonius, L. Caesar, all ex-consuls. In 86, after the sudden death of Marius, 
the general's associate, Q. Sertorius, summoned the executioners on the pretext 
of distributing their pay, then cut them down en masse to the number of some 
4,000. In 82, when the Optimates finally triumphed, they too massacred their 
prisoners: 'the clatter of arms and the groans of the dying were distinctly heard 
in the Temple of Bellona, where Sulla was just holding a meeting of the 
Senate'. 14 

Thereafter, to avoid such scenes, the procedure of proscription was 
formalized. Victorious factions would post a list of names in the Forum to 
summon the leaders of the defeated faction to stand trial or risk confiscation. 
Men on the list who killed themselves in time, usually by opening their veins in 
a warm bath, could save their families from ruin. Those who failed to do so 
found their names on a new list, carved in marble, declaring their lives and the 
property of their kin to be forfeit. In 43, for example, the proscription of the 
second triumvirate caused the deaths of at least 300 senators and 2,000 knights. 



Among them was Cicero, whose head and hands, severed from the corpse, were 
exhibited on the rostra of the Forum. Where the ruling class of Rome set an 
example, the populace followed, [ludi] 

The Roman Revolution' is not a term that was used in ancient times. But it has 
been widely accepted by historians who see the transition from Republic to 
Principate as the product of profound social transformations. In other words, it is 
not an established historical event so much as the subject of modern sociological 
theorizing. The period witnessed the violent transfer of power and property,' 
wrote its chief interpreter, 'and the Principate of Augustus should be regarded as 
the consolidation of the revolutionary process.'- In this scenario the chief 
victim was the old Roman aristocracy. The chief revolutionary was Caesar's heir, 
the young Octavius-a 'chill and mature terrorist', a gangster, a 'chameleon' 
who presented himself in turns as bloodthirsty avenger or moderate peacemaker. 
The resultant changes included the ruin of the established governing class, the 
promotion of new social elements, the domination of Rome by ambitious Italian 
outsiders, and, with their support, the emergence of a de facto monarchy. The 
key to Roman politics lay in the patronage of the rival dynasts-especially 
Caesar, Pompey, Mark Antony, and Octavius. The key to understanding the 
essential mechanisms lies in the art of prosopography-which analyses the 
detailed careers of a class in order to uncover the inducements which animate 
them. (Syme, relying heavily on the work of Miinzer, did for Roman history 
what Lewis Namier did for Georgian England.) 'Political life', he wrote, 'was 
stamped and swayed not by the parties and programmes of a modern 
parliamentary character, not by the ostensible opposition of Senate and People 
... but by the struggle for power, wealth, and glory.'- Particularly important in 
an age of civil war was a politician's ability to control the army and to satisfy the 
soldiers with lands, money, and respect. Fighting, it would seem, was only a 
secondary preoccupation for successful generals. 


LUDI 

The people who have conquered the world', wrote Juvenal, 'now have only 
two interests-bread and circuses.' The art of conversation is dead!' 





exclaimed Seneca. 'Can no one today talk of anything else than charioteers?' 
The Ludi or 'Games' had become a central feature of Roman life. Originally 
staged on four set weeks during the year in April, July, September, and 
November, they grew to the point where the Circus Maximus and the 
Colosseum were in almost permanent session. At the first recorded Games in 
264 bc, three pairs of slaves had fought to the death. Four centuries later, the 
Emperor Trajan laid on a festival where 10,000 persons and 11,000 animals 
perished. 1 

Professional gladiators provided shows of mortal combat. Marching in 
procession through the Gate of Life, they entered the arena and addressed 
the imperial podium with the traditional shout: ave, caesari morituri salu- 
tamus (Hail Caesari We, who are about to die, greet thee). Nimble retiarii 
with net and trident faced heavily armed secutores with sword and shield. 
Sometimes they would join forces against teams of captives or exotic 
barbarians. The corpses of the losers were dragged out on meat hooks 
through the Gate of Death. If a gladiator fell wounded, the emperor or other 
president of the Games would signal by 'thumbs up' or 'thumbs down' 
whether he should be reprieved or killed. Promoters exploited the rivalry of 
gladiatorial schools, and advertised the feats of famous performers. 

One programme which has survived listed a fight between . T v Pugnax 
Ner III and M. p Murranus Ner III, i.e. two fighters from the Neronian 
school in Capua, each with three wins, one fighting with (T)hracian arms- 
small shield and curved sword-and the other in Gallic (M)yrmillo style. 
Pugnax came out v(ictor), whilst Murranus ended up p(eritus), dead. 2 

The thirst for grand spectacles gradually led to the practice where 
gladiatorial shows were interspersed with venationes or 'wild-beast hunts', 
by full-scale military battles, and even by naval contests in a flooded arena. 
In time, acts of gross obscenity, bestiality, and mass cruelty were demanded. 
Popular stories elaborated scenes of spreadeagled girls smeared with the 
vaginal fluid of cows and raped by wild bulls, of Christian captives roasted 
alive, crucified, set alight or thrown to the lions, or of wretches forced to 
paddle in sinking boats across water filled with crocodiles. These were only 
passing variations in an endless variety of victims and torments. They 
continued until the Christian Emperor Honorius overruled the Senate and put 
an end to the Games in ad 404. 

Nothing, however, roused such passions as chariot-racing, which began 



in Rome and continued in Byzantium. Traditionally, six teams of four horses 
careered seven times round the spine of the circus, competing for vast prizes. 
Sensational spills and fatal crashes were routine. Huge bets were placed. 
Successful charioteers became idols of the mob, and as wealthy as senators. 
Successful horses were commemorated by stone statues: 'Tuscus, driven by 
Fortunatus of the Blues, 386 wins.' 

Racing was in the hands of the four corporations-Whites, Reds, Greens, 
and Blues, who supplied the competing stables, teams, and drivers. The 
Tactions' of circus supporters were responsible for many a riot. In Byzantine 
times they were institutionalized, and were once thought to have formed the 
basis for incipient political parties. This theory is now largely abandoned; 
but faction-like associations were still performing in late Byzantine 
ceremonies. The Christian Church always frowned. 'Some put their trust in 
chariots and some in horses; but we will remember the Name of the Lord 
Our God.' 3 


Overall, it is a cynical picture. Shifting alliances of convenience predominate 
over parties of principle. Political concepts-Cicero's libertas populi, auctoritas 
Senatus, concordia ordinum, consensus Italiae -are presented as mere slogans 
and catchwords. The Roman constitution was 'a screen and a sham, a mere 
facade for men's baser instincts'. The old aristocracy could be bought. The new 
men were driven by greed and vanity. They were the Trousered Senators', the 
'ghastly and disgusting rabble' of Caesar's provincial dependants; the Thousand 
creatures' installed in the Senate by the second triumvirate; the servile apologists 
and propagandists whom Octavius hired to win public opinion and to distort 
history. Behind the scenes lurked the bankers, the millionaire paymasters, the 
adventurers-C. Maecenas, L. Cornelius Balbus from Gades, C. Rabirius 
Posthumus, treasurer of Alexandria. 

In this scenario, therefore, the turning-point occurred already in 43 bc, during 
the proscriptions of the second triumvirate which followed Caesar's death and in 
which, to his discredit, Octavian took the lead: 

The Republic had been abolished ... Despotism ruled, supported by violence and confiscation. The best 
men were dead or proscribed. The Senate was packed with ruffians. The Consulate, once the reward of civic 
virtue, now became the recompense of craft or crime. Non mos, non ius... The Caesarians claimed the right 
and duty of avenging Caesar... Out of the blood of Caesar the monarchy was born.- 





The rest was an epilogue. All cried 'Liberty', and all longed for peace. 'When 
peace came, it was the peace of despotism.' 

None the less, it is not possible to dismiss all the works of Augustus (r. 31 
bc-ad 14) as the fruits of propaganda. He undoubtedly had a seamier side but, 
importantly for the Romans, the omens were with him. Suetonius tells the story 
how the future Emperor's mother had been entered by a serpent during a 
midnight service in the Temple of Apollo nine months before his birth. But then 
a comet had appeared in the sky when he first celebrated the Ludi Victoriae 
Caesar is. And on the eve of Actium, where he left the battle to subordinates like 
Agrippa, he met a Greek peasant driving an ass along the shore. 'I am Eutyches 
[Prosper],' said the peasant, 'and this is my ass Nikon [Victory].'- [condom] 

The nature of the early Empire, or Principate, is particularly deceptive. The 
Emperor Augustus achieved lasting power for himself and his successors, not by 
the abolition of republican institutions, but by collecting all the offices that 
controlled them. He made himself Imperator or 'Supreme Commander', Consul, 
Tribune, Censor, Pontifex Maximus, and Proconsul of Spain, Gaul, Syria and 
Cilicia, etc. As a result, he possessed powers as extensive as many an autocrat; 
but he did not exercise them through centralized autocratic channels. He 
replaced the pseudo-republic of the senatorial oligarchy with a quasi-empire, 
whose old institutions were obliged to work in a new way. As Princeps senatus, 
a new office, he acted as chairman of the Senate, whose membership was drawn 
either from ex-magistrates, whom he would have appointed, or from imperial 
nominees. He left the Senate in charge of roughly half the provinces, into which 
all the Empire was now divided; but he subjected their deliberations to an 
imperial veto. Dictatorial powers were delegated to former municipal offices 
such as those of the Praefectus Urbi in charge of criminal jurisdiction, or of the 
Praefectus Annonae, in charge of trade, markets, and the corn dole. Similarly, 
numerous boards of Curatores or Commissioners, overseeing everything from 
roads and rivers to the repair of public buildings, now answered solely to the 
Emperor. The growth of a more formal autocracy was a development of 
Christian times, especially in the Eastern Empire, where Persian influences were 
strong. (See Appendix III, p. 1223.) 

The main law-making procedures of the Republic were gradually abandoned. 
But many of its statutes remained. The comitia tributa was occasionally 
summoned to confirm laws passed by other bodies; and the senatus consulta or 


'decisions of the Senate' were still issued. From the second century ad, however, 
the Emperor became the sole source of new law-through his edicts, or 
ordinances, his rescripts or 'written judgements' on petitions, his decreta or 
rulings on judicial appeals, and his mandates or administrative instructions. By 
that time the Senate had been replaced as the supreme court of appeal by the 
Emperor's praetorian prefect. 


CONDOM 

In 18 BC, and again in ad 9, Emperor Augustus attempted to increase the 
fertility of the Empire's population through decrees curbing abortion and 
infanticide. From this and other sources it is clear that the Romans were 
familiar with many methods of contraception, including herbs: spermicidal 
douches containing cedar gum, vinegar or olive oil, vaginal pessaries soaked 
in honey, and condoms fashioned from goats' bladders. One Roman writer 
advised: 'Wear the liver of a cat in a tube on the left foot... or part of the 
womb of a lioness in a tube of ivory.' 1 

Research into medieval practices once suggested that the necessary 
mentality for 'diverting nature' was simply not present. 2 But this view has 
been revised. Examination of church penitentials shows that the subject was 
much discussed, especially since the 'sins of Onan' can reasonably be taken 
to include coitus interruptus. 3 Dante's hints in Paradiso xv (106-9) about 
Florence's 'empty family houses' and about 'what was possible in the 
bedchamber' leave little to the modern imagination. The increase of urban 
prostitution increased an interest in avoiding pregnancy. The Cathars, too, 
were notoriously non-pro-life. In the 1320s, the inquisitors succeeded in 
persuading a Cathar priest's lover to reveal their techniques: 

When [the priest] wanted to know me carnally, he used to wear this herb 
wrapped up in a piece of linen .. .about the size of the first joint of my little 
finger. And he had a long cord which he used to put round my neck when we 
made love; and this thing or herb at the end of the cord used to hang down as 
far as the opening of my stomach ... It might happen that he might want to 
know me carnally twice or more in a single night. In that case, the priest 




would ask me before uniting his body with mine: Where is the herb? ... I 
would put the herb in his hand and then he himself would place it at the 
opening of my stomach, still with the cord between my breasts. 

The only detail missing was the name of the herb. 4 

Historical demographers studying Italian merchant families and English 
villages have concluded that births must have been kept artificially low in 
both the medieval and modern periods. 5 In the eighteenth century, lechers 
like James Boswell made no secret of using 'armour'. Their Continental 
counterparts talked of 'English overcoats' or 'umbrellas'. Their hero was the 
mysterious Captain Condom, said to have been either physician or 
commander of the guard at the Court of Charles II. 6 The first pope to have 
condemned contraceptive practices was supposedly Clement XII in 1731. 

Modern campaigners for birth control did not advocate contraception in 
the cause of permissiveness. Marie Stopes, though packed with 
nymphomaniac drive, was also an old-fashioned romantic. In Married Love 
and Wise Parenthood, she was arguing to give women the chance of relief 
from child-bearing and of enjoyable love-making within marriage. 7 Military 
authorities who distributed 'French letters' to troops on the Western Front 
were concerned both for the soldiers' health and for civilian relations. 
Abortion remained the principal technique in the Communist world, as in the 
Roman Empire. In the West, contraception was not linked to changing sexual 
mores until the availability of 'the Pill' and of free clinical advice for 
unmarried adolescents in the 1960s. Yet, as a jingle of the 1920s recalls, 
success was nowhere guaranteed: 

Jeanie, Jeanie, full of hopes 
Read a book by Marie Stopes. 

But, to judge from her condition, 

She must have read the wrong edition. 8 


With the passage of time, the vast corpus of Roman law had to be repeatedly 
codified. There were three such partial attempts in the Codex Gregorianus (ad 
c.295), the Codex Hermogenianus (c.324), and the Codex Theodosianus (438). 
Similarly, in the Edict of Theodoric (before 515), the so-called Breviary of 




Alaric (506), and the Burgundian Code (516), barbarian rulers attempted to 
summarize the law which they found in provinces captured from Rome. Yet the 
main work of systematization was undertaken under the Emperor Justinian. 
Between them, the fifty Decisions (531), the Institutes (533), the Digest of the 
Jurists (534), the Revised Code (534), and the Novels (565) covered every aspect 
of public and private, criminal and civil, secular and ecclesiastical law. It was 
through the Justinian law-books that this huge heritage was transmitted to the 
modern world, [lex] 

The term provincia, 'sphere of action', originally referred to the jurisdiction 
of magistrates sent to govern conquered lands. Under the Empire, it came to 
refer to the lands themselves. Each province was given a charter, the lex 
provincialis, which determined its limits, its subdivisions, and its privileges. 
Each was entrusted to a governor, either a proconsul or a propraetor, who raised 
troops, collected tribute, and through 'edicts' spoke with the force of law. Each 
governor was accompanied by a staff of legates appointed by the Senate, by a 
military guard, and by an army of clerks. A distinction was made between 
imperial provinces, which the Emperor retained under his direct control, and 
senatorial provinces, which were left to the Senate. The creation of provinces 
had far-reaching consequences both for Rome and for the fate of the Empire. In 
the short run, Rome thrived mightily from the vast influx of tribute and from the 
constant traffic in people and goods. In the long run, through the steady internal 
consolidation of the provinces, the capital city was squeezed from the sources of 
wealth and power. Over four centuries, 'Mother Rome' was gradually rendered 
redundant by her own children. 

As Rome waned, the provinces waxed. In the first stage, provincial elites 
supplied the droves of newcomer knights and senators who swamped the 
traditional oligarchy and ran the Empire. In the second stage, when the military 
forces were concentrated on an increasingly self-sufficient periphery, provincial 
cities such as Lugdunum (Lyons) or Mediolanum (Milan) flourished in 
competition with Rome. Political life was plagued by the rivalries of provincial 
generals, many of whom became emperors. In the third stage, the links between 
the periphery and Rome were weakened to the point where the provinces began 
to claim autonomous status. Especially in the West, the fruit was ready to fall 
from the tree. The centrifugal shift of power and resources was one of the 
underlying causes of the Empire's later distress, [illyricum] [lugdunum] 

The Empire's finances, like its provinces, were split into two sectors. The 



Aerarium of the Senate was the successor to the Republican Treasury in the 
Temple of Saturn and Ops. The imperial Fiscus was an innovation of Augustus. 
In theory, it was separate from the Emperor's private property, the patrimonium 
Caesaris; in practice, the boundaries were not respected. The main items of 
income included rent from the state lands in Italy, tribute from the provinces, 
portaria or 'gate dues', the state monopoly in salt, the mint, direct taxes on 
slaves, manumissions and inheritance, and extraordinary loans. Apart from the 
army, the main items of expenditure included religious ceremonies, public 
works, administration, poor relief and the corn dole, and the imperial court. In 
time, imperial agents took over all tax-collecting outside Rome. 

The army was gradually increased in size and strength, reaching a maximum 
in 31 bc of almost sixty legions. After Actium, the Empire's permanent defence 
force consisted of 28 legions of c.6,000 professionals apiece. The Navy 
maintained squadrons on the Rhine and the Danube, as well as in the 
Mediterranean. From 2 bc Augustus initiated the nine cohorts of the elite 
praetorian lifeguard, based in Rome. The soldiers were paid 720 d. per annum 
for a praetorian, 300 d. for a cavalryman, 225 d. for a legionary, and they served 
for twenty years. 

The legions were known by number and by name. Augustus retained the 
sequential numbering used both by his own and by Mark Antony's army, 
awarding distinctive names to legions with the same number. Hence there was a 
Legio III Augusta and a Legio III Cyrenaica, a Legio VI Victrix and a Legio VI 
Ferrata. Several legions possessed the number I, since emperors liked to give 
seniority to units raised by themselves. Legions which were destroyed in battle, 
such as the XVII, XVIII, and XIX lost in Germany, or the Legio IX Hispana 
wiped out in Britain in ad 120, were never restored. 

The limes, the 'frontier line', was a vital feature of the Empire's defence. It 
was not, as is sometimes supposed, an impenetrable barrier. From the military 
point of view it was more of a cordon, or series of parallel cordons, which, 
whilst deterring casual incursions, would trigger active counter-measures as soon 
as it was seriously breached. It was a line which normally could only be crossed 
by paying portaria and by accepting the Empire's authority. It was, above all, a 
marker which left no one in doubt as to which lands were subject to Roman 
jurisdiction and which were not. Its most important characteristic was its 
continuity. It ran up hill and down dale without a break, and along all frontier 
rivers and coasts. In places, as in Britain, it took the form of a Great Wall on the 



Chinese model. Elsewhere it might carry a wooden stockade atop earthworks, or 
a string of linked coastal forts, or, as in Africa, blocks of fortified farmhouses 
facing the desert interior. Its guarded crossing-points were clearly marked with 
gates and roadways. They naturally became the focus for towns and cities which 
grew round the military camps and markets which the upkeep of the frontier 
required. 


ILLYRICUM 

The Roman province of Illyricum occupied the eastern shore of the Adriatic 
between the Italian district of Istria and the Greek province of Epirus. It was 
bounded to the north by Pannonia beyond the river Dravus and to the east by 
Moesia and Macedonia. It was known to the Greeks as Illyris Barbara, being 
the part of ancient Illyria which had remained free from the conquests of 
Philip of Macedon. In imperial times it was divided into three prefectures- 
Liburnia and Dalmatia on the coast and lapydia in the interior. Apart from 
Siscia (modern Zagreb) and Narona (Mostar), its principal cities were all 
seaports-Tartatica, Ader (Zadar), Salonae (Split), Epidaurum. The 
southernmost fortress city of Lissus had been founded by Syracusan 
colonists in 385 bc. (See Appendix III, p. 1231.) 

Illyricum was subdued in stages. It first paid tribute to Rome in 229 BC, 
and was twice overrun during the Macedonian Wars of the second century. It 
was fully incorporated under Augustus in 23 BC. Having participated in the 
great Pannonian revolt of ad 6-9, it remained in the Empire until Byzantine 
times. 

Little is known of the ancient Illyrians. Their language was Indo- 
European, and probably supplied an underlying stratum to modern Albanian. 
Their material culture was renowned for its sophisticated metal-work. From 
the sixth century their 'Situla art' was distinguished by fine repousse figures 
set on bronze wine-buckets amidst scenes of feasting, racing, and riding. A 
silver coinage was minted in the third century. Illyrian warriors fought in 
chain-mail like the Scythians, but not in chariots like the Celts. 1 

Illyricum gave birth to two Roman emperors and to St Jerome. The 




Emperor Diocletian retired to a grandiose palace built on the seafront of his 
native Salonae. His octagonal mausoleum survived as a Christian church- 
an ironic fate for the resting-place of the Christians' last great persecutor. St 
Jerome was born at nearby Strido in ad 347, more than 200 years before the 
first appearance of the Slavs who were to lay the foundations of the future 
Croatia, Bosnia, and Montenegro. 

Illyricum, like Britannia, belongs to a group of Roman provinces whose 
ethnic and cultural connections were totally transformed by the great 
migrations (see Chapter IV). But the memory of the Illyrians was cherished 
by their successors. Their legacy is very different from that bequeathed to 
those parts of Europe which never knew Rome at all. [Illyria] 


LUGDUNUM 

In 43 BC the Proconsul- Muniatus Plancus drew the centre-line of a new 
city overlooking the confluence of the Rhone and the Saone. Lugdunum was 
to be the principal city of Roman Gaul, the meeting-point of a star-like 
network of paved roads. Its amphitheatres can still be seen on the hill of 
Fourvieres. It commanded not only the Rhone-Rhine corridor but the route 
leading north-west from Italy to the Channel. 1 

The Rhone, though navigable, was a swift and turbulent river. 
Downstream, ships risked being wrecked on numerous reefs and islands; 
upstream, they could only make headway against the current with the help of 
horses. In the decades before the arrival of steamboats in 1821, 6,000 horses 
worked the towpath, hauling cargoes up to Lyons before floating back down 
on rafts. 

From 1271 to 1483, the lower Rhone constituted an international frontier. 
The left bank, known as I'Empi, lay in the Holy Roman Empire. The right 
bank, le Riaume, and all the islands, belonged to the Kingdom of France. 
Fifteen stone bridges were built between Geneva and Aries; and several sets 
of twin towns, such as Valence and Beaucaire, grew up on opposing banks. 

In that same era, Lyons recovered the economic pre-eminence which it 




had once commanded in ancient Gaul. It was annexed to France by Philippe 
le Bel, who entered the city on 3 March 1311, after which it headed 'the 
French isthmus' linking France's northern and southern possessions. From 
1420 it hosted four international fairs annually; from 1464 it received 
privileges aimed at subverting the commerce of Geneva; and from 1494 to 
1559 it supplied the logistical base for France's Italian wars. Its merchant 
elite was distinguished by many Italian families, including the Medici, the 
Guadagni (Gadagne), and numerous Genoese. This 'lively, determined and 
secretive city', 'caught up in whirlpools and rhythms of a very particular 
kind', made itself 'the leading centre of the European economy.' 2 

'Vieux Lyons', the old quarter nestling beside the Saone, recalls the 
city's golden decades. A hillside warren of narrow streets connected by 
tunnel-like traboules or 'transambulant passage-ways', it is crowded with 
highly ornamented Gothic and Renaissance hotels, courtyards, squares, and 
churches. Its names, from the Manecanterie or 'cathedral choir-school' to the 
Hotel de Gadagne on the Rue Juiverie or 'Jewry Street', ring with the 
memory of colourful bygone inhabitants. The Place Bellecour was laid out 
under Louis XIV on the interfluvial plain. Its statue of the Sun King, which 
had been shipped from Paris by sea, came to grief in transit and had to be 
fished from the river. 

Given Lyons's strategic location, and its industrial prowess based on silk 
[jacquard], geographers have wondered why it never ousted Paris as 
France's capital. The prospect has remained an unrealized possibility. From 
1311 Lyons has had to be content as France's second city. For geography 
only determines what is possible; it does not determine which possibility 
will triumph. 'A country is a storehouse of dormant energies', wrote the 
master, 'whose seeds have been planted by nature but whose use depends on 
man.' 3 


Thanks to the limes, Rome could manage its relations with the barbarians in 
an orderly fashion. Throughout the Empire, barbarian officers and auxiliaries 
served with the Roman army, and barbarian tribes were settled by agreement in 
the imperial provinces. The romanization of barbarians, and the barbarization of 
Romans, were processes that had been operating since the earliest conquests of 
the Republic in Italy. After all, Caesar's 'trousered senators' were Romans of 




Celtic origin who still liked to wear their native leggings under their togas. 

Societies, it has been said, rot from the head down, like dead fish. Certainly, the 
list of early emperors contains more than its share of degenerates. 

The Emperor Tiberius (r. ad 14-37), adopted son of Augustus, left Rome for 
Capri, to practise his cruelties and perversions. Under him, mass proscriptions 
returned to fashion, fuelled by the deadly work of the delatores or informers. 
Caligula (r. 37-41) ordered himself deified in his lifetime, and appointed his 
horse to a consulship. 'It was his habit to commit incest with each of his three 
sisters in turn,' Suetonius wrote; 'and, at large banquets when his wife reclined 
above him, he placed them all in turn below him.' 'Because of his baldness and 
hairiness, he announced that it was a capital offence for anyone to mention goats 
in any context.'- He succumbed to an assassin who struck, appropriately, at his 
genitals. Claudius (r. 41-54), who married two murderous wives, Messalina and 
Agrippina, was poisoned by a toadstool sauce mixed with his mushrooms.- 

The Emperor Nero (r. 54-68), an obsessive aesthete and sybarite, disposed of 
his mother by having her stabbed (after an attempted drowning miscarried). He 
murdered his aunt by administering a laxative of fatal strength, executed his first 
wife on a false charge of adultery, and kicked his pregnant second wife to death. 
'Not satisfied with seducing free-born boys and married women,' wrote 
Suetonius, 'he raped the Vestal Virgin Rubria.' Then: 

Having tried to turn the boy Sporus into a girl by castration, he went through a wedding ceremony with him 
-dowry, bridal veil and all-which the whole Court attended; then brought him home and treated him as a 
wife ... The world would have been a happier place had Nero's father Domitius married the same sort of a 
wife . 21 


In the end, he committed suicide with the words Qualis ardfex pereo (what an 
artist perishes in me). 

The Emperor Galba (r. 68-9), a military man, was killed by the mutinous 
military in 'the year of the four emperors', as were his successors Otho and 
Vitellius. Vespasian (r. 69-79), son of a provincial tax-gatherer, succeeded in his 
main aim-'to die on his feet'. His last words were 'Dear me, I must be turning 
into a god.'- Titus (r. 79-81) was supposedly poisoned by his brother, after a 
reign of unusual felicity marred only by the eruption of Mt Vesuvius. The 
supposed poisoner, the Emperor Domitian (r. 81-96), was stabbed to death by 
his wife and her accomplices. Eight of the ten immediate successors of Augustus 


had died a nasty death, [panta] 


Yet Rome's Indian summer still lay ahead. 'If a man were called to fix the period 
in the history of the world, during which the condition of the human race was 
most happy and prosperous,' wrote Gibbon, 'he would, without hesitation, name 
that which elapsed from the death of Domitian to the accession of Commodus.'- 
Under the emperors Nerva (r. 96-8), Trajan (r. 98-117), Hadrian (r. 117-38), 
Antoninus Pius (r. 138-61), and Marcus Aurelius (r. 161-80), the Empire not 
only reached its greatest geographical extent but enjoyed an unrivalled era of 
calm and stability. Nerva initiated the tradition of poor relief; Trajan was an 
honest, indefatigable soldier; Hadrian a builder and patron of the arts. Of 
Antoninus Pius, Gibbon wrote: 'His reign is marked by the rare advantage of 
furnishing very few materials for history, which is, indeed, little more than the 
register of the crimes, follies, and misfortunes of mankind.'- 

The minutiae of imperial administration during its heyday have survived in 
the voluminous correspondence of the Emperor Trajan with Pliny the Younger, 
administrator of Bithynia-Pontus: 

pliny. Nicaea has expended 10,000,000 sesterces on a theatre that was 
tottering and great sums on a gymnasium that was burned ... At 
Claudiopolis, they are excavating a bathhouse at the foot of the 
mountain... What am I to do? 

trajan. You are on the spot, decide for yourself. As for architects, we at 
Rome send to Greece for them. You should find some where you are. 

pliny. The money due to the towns of the province has been called in, and 
no borrowers at 12 per cent are to be found. Ought I to reduce the rate of 
interest... or compel the decurions to borrow the money in equal shares? 
Trajan. Put the interest low enough to attract borrowers, but do not force 
anyone to borrow... Such a course would be inconsistent with the temper 
of our century. 

pliny. Byzantium has a legionary centurion sent by the Legatus of Lower 
Moesia... to watch over its privileges. Juliopolis... requests the same 
favour. 

trajan. Byzantium is a great city... But if I give such help to Juliopolis, all 
small towns will want the same thing. 

pliny. A great fire has devastated Nicomedia. Would it be in order to 


establish a society of 150 firemen? 

trajan. No. Corporations, whatever they're called, are sure to become 
political associations ... 

pliny. I have never been present at the resolutions concerning the Christians, 
therefore I know not for what causes... they may be objects of 
punishment... Are those who retract to be pardoned? Must they be 
punished for their profession alone? 

trajan. The Christians need not be sought out. If they are brought into your 
presence and convicted, they must be punished. But anonymous 
information against them should not carry any weight in the charges.- 


PANTA 

When the city of Colonia Cornelia Veneria Pompeiana was buried 
under five metres of volcanic ash on 24 August ad 79, all forms of human 
life were extinguished-the elegant, the mundane, and the seamy. Yet when 
Pompeii was excavated, mainly from 1869 onwards, one aspect of its former 
life, its dedication to Venus, was officially concealed. A huge collection of 
objects which offended against the nineteenth century's fear of obscenity 
were kept for decades in the stanze proibiti or 'prohibited sections' of the 
National Museum in Naples. 1 

The sexual commerce of Pompeii, in contrast, was plied without shame 
or hypocrisy. Brothels or lupinari were located in all parts of the town, and 
openly advertised their menus and their tariffs. The cheapest girls, such as 
Successa or Optata, charged 2 assi; Speranza charged 8, Attica 16. Outside 
brothels, there were notices to discourage eavesdroppers. One notice read: 
'No place for idlers ... Clear off'. Inside, there were pictures to encourage 
the customers. Paintings and sculptures of sexual subjects were common, 
even in private houses. Murals portraying the 'mysteries' of the city's cults 
had a semi-sacred character. Phalluses of gigantic proportions were on 
frequent display. They served as the flame-holders of oil-lamps, as the 
centrepiece of comic drawings, even as the spouts of drinking cups. 
Humorous trinkets showing male gods with divine equipment, or the god 
Pan plunging an upturned she-goat, were commonplace. 





Many of the city's whores are known by name or, like actresses, by their 
noms de scene: hence Panta (Everything), Culibonia (Lovely Bum), 
Kallitremia (Super Crotch), Laxa (Spacious), Landicosa (Big Clit), or 
Extaliosa (Back Channel). Their clients are also known by name or 
nickname. One was Enoclione (Valorous Toper), another Skordopordonikos 
(Garlic Farter). The chief ponce of Pompeii's largest brothel died shortly 
before the volcano erupted. His servant had scratched an obituary on the 
gate: Tor All Who Grieve. Africanus Is Dead. Rusticus Wrote This.' The 
trade was both bisexual and bilingual: rent boys were available for both 
sexes, and the language of the game was either Greek or Latin. The essential 
vocabulary included futuere, Lngere, fellare; phallus, mentula, verpa; 
cunnus or connos (m.) and lupa. 

Most expressive are the graffiti, ancient moments of triumph and disaster 
recorded for all time:

With Marcus Aurelius (r. 161-80) Rome received a true philosopher-king. A 
disciple of Epictetus, he trained himself to withstand the rigours of constant 
campaigning, the burdens of office, and the demands of a profligate family. His 
notes To Myself', known as his Meditations, exude all the higher sentiments: 

What peculiar distinction remains for a wise and good man, but to be easy and contented under every event 
of human life...? Not to offend the divine Principle that resides in his soul, nor to disturb the tranquillity of 
his mind by a variety of fantastical pursuits ... To observe a strict regard to truth in his words and justice in 
his actions; and though all mankind should conspire to question his integrity and modesty... he is not 
offended at their incredulity, nor yet deviates from the path which leads him to the true end of life, at which 
everyone should endeavour to arrive with a clear conscience, undaunted and prepared for his dissolution, 
resigned to his fate without murmuring or reluctance.- 





Marcus Aurelius had a marvellous sense of who, and where, he was: 

As the Emperor Antoninus, Rome is my city and my country, but as a man, I am 
a citizen of the world ... Asia and Europe are mere corners of the globe, the 
Great Ocean a mere drop of water, Mount Athos is a grain of sand in the 
universe. The present instant of time is only a point compared to eternity. All 
things here are diminutive, subject to change and decay, yet all things proceed 
from ... the one Intelligent Cause.- 

By the mid-third century the Roman Empire was showing all the outward 
symptoms of an inner wasting disease. Political decadence was apparent in the 
lack of resolve at the centre, and in disorder on the periphery. In the ninety years 
from ad 180 no fewer than eighty short-lived emperors claimed the purple, by 
right or by usurpation. 'The reign of Gallienus', wrote Gibbon, 'produced only 
nineteen pretenders to the throne ... The rapid and perpetual transitions from the 
cottage to the throne, and from the throne to the grave, might have amused an 
indifferent philosopher.'- The army dictated to its civilian masters with 
impunity. The barbarians flooded over the limes, often unchecked. The raids of 
the Goths turned into permanent occupations. In 268 they sacked Athens. One 
breakaway 'Empire', under a certain Postumus, appeared in central Gaul, and 
another in Palmyra. The difficulty of enforcing the cult of worthless or transient 
emperors led to recurrent persecution of the growing Christian sect. From 250 to 
265, plague raged in many regions: for a time, 5,000 people a day were dying in 
Rome alone. Famine followed the plague. Severe price inflation set in, 
accompanied by a seriously debased coinage. Marcus Aurelius had issued an 
imperial silver coin of 75 per cent purity. Under Gallienus (r. 260-8), a century 
later, it was 95 per cent impure. Tax revenues slumped; the imperial authorities 
concentrated resources in the frontier provinces; elsewhere, many provincial 
centres declined; amphitheatres were demolished to provide stone for defensive 
walls. 

Even under Diocletian (r. 284-305), whose twenty-one years have been seen 
as the 'founding of a new empire', all was far from well. The tetrarchy, or 'rule 
of four', which divided the Empire into two halves, each with its own Augustus 
and its own deputy Caesar, facilitated administration and frontier defence. The 
army was greatly increased-but so was the bureaucracy. The rise in prices was 
controlled-but not the fall in population. The Christian persecutions continued. 
In 304 a great Triumph was organized in Rome; but it was the last. One year 
later, Diocletian abdicated, retiring to his native Dalmatia. 


Flavius Valerius Constantinus (r. 306-37), later called 'Constantine the 
Great', was born at Naissus in Moesia Superior (i.e. Nis, in modern Serbia, not, 
as Gibbon says, in Dacia). His father, Constantius Chlorus, Diocletian's Western 
Caesar, died at Eboracum (York) soon after succeeding to the purple. His mother, 
Helena, was a British Christian, revered in legend as the discoverer of the True 
Cross. Constantine reunited the two parts of the divided Empire and, in the Edict 
of Milan, proclaimed general religious toleration. At two crucial moments of his 
career he claimed to have had a vision. Initially, the vision was said to have been 
of Apollo, later of a Cross, together with the words 'By this you will conquer'. 
He quarrelled with the citizens of Rome, and determined to move his capital to 
the shores of the Bosphorus. On his deathbed he was formally baptized into 
Christianity. In this way, at the moment of its Emperor's Christian conversion, 
Rome ceased to be the centre of the Empire which it had created. 

Christianity 

In its origins, Christianity was not a European religion. Like Judaism and Islam, 
to which it is related, it came from Western Asia; and Europe did not become its 
main area of concentration for several centuries. 

Jesus of Nazareth (C.5BC-33AD), Jewish nonconformist and itinerant 
preacher, was born in the Roman province of Judaea in the middle of the reign of 
Augustus. He was executed in Jerusalem, by crucifixion, during the reign of 
Tiberius (14-37AD) and the procuratorship of Pontius Pilatus, praenomen 
unknown, a Roman knight who may later have served at Vienna (Vienne) in 
Gaul. Reportedly,, though no fault was found in him, the procurator acquiesced 
in the demands of the Jewish Sanhedrin to put him to death, [crux] 

Apart from four short gospels, whose evidence is partly repetitive and partly 
contradictory, few facts are known about the life of Jesus. There is no historical 
document which mentions him, and there is no trace of him in Roman literary 
sources. He did not even attract major notice from the Jewish writers of the 
period such as Josephus or Philo. His personal teaching is known only from a 
score of parables, from his sayings during the various incidents and miracles of 
his ministry, from his talks with the apostles, and from a handful of key 
pronouncements: his Sermon on the Mount, his answers in the Temple and at his 
trial, his discourse at the Last Supper, his words on the Cross. He claimed to be 
the 'Messiah', the long-foretold saviour of the Jewish scriptures; but he reduced 



the vast corpus of those scriptures to two simple commandments: 


Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul and with all thy 
mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy 
neighbour as thyself. (Matt. 22:37-9) 


Jesus did not challenge the secular authorities, stressing on several occasions, 
'My kingdom is not of this world'. When he died, he left no organization, no 
church or priesthood, no political testament, no Gospel, indeed; just the 
enigmatic instruction to his disciples: 

If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and 
follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose 
his life for my sake shall find it. (Matt. 16: 24-5) 

That Christianity should have become the official religion of the Roman 
Empire could hardly have been foreseen. For generations of Christian believers 
in later times, the triumph of Christianity was simply the will of God. It was not 
seriously questioned or analysed. But for many Romans in the early centuries it 
must have presented a real puzzle. Jesus was long regarded as an obscure, local 
phenomenon. His followers, whose beliefs were confused by outsiders with 
Judaism, were unlikely candidates to found a religion of universal appeal. The 
faith of slaves and simple fishermen offered no advantage for class or sectional 
interest. Their gospel, which made such a clear distinction between the spiritual 
'Kingdom of God' and the rule of Caesar, seemed to have resigned in advance 
from all secular ambitions. Even when they became more numerous, and were 
repressed for refusing to participate in the imperial cult, Christians could hardly 
be seen as a general menace, [apocalypse] 

Of course, one may see with hindsight that Christianity's emphasis on the 
inner life was filling a spiritual void to which the Roman lifestyle gave no relief; 
also that the Christian doctrine of redemption, and the triumph over death, must 
have exerted great attractions. But one can also understand the bafflement of 
imperial officials, like Pliny the Younger in Bithynia (see p. 191 above). It is one 
thing to decide that the ancient world was ripe for a new 'Salvationist' religion; 
it is quite. 

to explain why the void should have been filled by Christianity rather than 
by half a dozen other candidates. Of all the sceptics writing about the rise of the 
Christian Church, none was more sceptical than Edward Gibbon. Gibbon's 
Decline and Fall contains on the one hand the most magnificent historical prose 



in the English language and on the other hand the most sustained polemic 
against the Church's departure from Christian principles. He conducted what he 
called 'a candid but rational enquiry into the progress and establishment of... a 
pure and humble religion [which] finally erected the triumphant banner of the 
Cross on the ruins of the Capitol'.- (See Appendix III, p. 1236.) 


CRUX 

Like the square, the circle, the triangle, the arrow, and the notch, the cross is 
one of the irreducible, primary signs that recur throughout human history. 
Sometimes called 'the sign of signs', it is used in science to denote 'add', 
'plus', and 'positive'. Owing to the crucifixion of Christ, however, it was 
adopted at an early stage as the prime symbol of Christianity. 

The Cross is omnipresent in the Christian World-in churches, on 
graves, on public monuments, in heraldry, on national flags. Christians are 
baptized with the sign of the Cross; they are blessed by their priests with the 
sign of the Cross; and they cross themselves-Catholics and Orthodox in 
opposite directions-when they implore divine assistance or when they 
listen to the Gospel. Medieval crusaders wore the Cross on their surcoats. 
The Christian Cross can be found in any number of variants, each with a 
specific symbolic or ornamental connotation. 1 (See Appendix III, p. 1229.) 

[DANNEBROG] 

Yet pre-Christian signs have long existed in Europe alongside their 
Christian counterparts. Best known is the age-old swastika or 'crooked 
cross', whose name derives from a Sanskrit phrase for 'well-being'. In 
ancient Chinese lore, it signified 'bad luck' when the hooks were turned 
down to the left, and 'good luck' when they were turned up to the right. In its 
Scandinavian form, it was thought to represent two crossed strokes of 
lightning giving light or two crossed sticks making fire. In its rounded Celtic 
form, common in Ireland, it was made to represent the sun. 2 It had several 
millennia behind it before the pagan Nazis chose a modern version of the 
hakenkreuz as their party emblem. 

Another example of the transmission of oriental and non-Christian 





insignia concerns the tamgas or 'pictorial charges' of the ancient Sarmatians. 
The tamgas, which occasionally resemble some of the more simple Chinese 
ideographs, reappeared in the tribal signs of the Turkish tribes, who 
advanced into the Near East in early medieval times. By this route, they are 
thought to have contributed to the system of Islamic heraldry which western 
crusaders were to encounter in the Holy Land. 3 At the same time, they bear a 
striking resemblance to signs which emerged at a somewhat later period in 
the unique heraldic system of Poland. As a result, scholars have been 
tempted to speculate that the familiar claim about the Polish nobility being 
descended from ancient Sarmatian ancestors may not be entirely fanciful. 
Their so-called 'Sarmatian Ideology', their heraldic clans, and their 
remarkable cavalry tradition have all been linked to the long-lost oriental 
horsemen of the steppes. One hypothesis holds that Poland's Sarmatian 
connection may best be explained as a legacy of the Sarmatian Alans who 
disappeared into the backwoods of Eastern Europe in the 4th century ad. 4

Symbols can arouse the deepest emotions. When the International Red 
Cross was founded in 1863, few Europeans realized that its emblem could be 
other than a universal symbol of compassion. But in due course it had to be 
supplemented with the Red Crescent, the Red Lion, and the Red Star. 
Similarly, when a Christian cross was raised on the site of the former Nazi 
Concentration Camp at Auschwitz, it caused bitter controversy, especially 



among those who were not aware that the victims of the camp included large 
numbers of Christians as well as Jews. In 1993, nine years of accusations 
and broken agreements were ended with the creation of an ecumenical 
memorial centre. 5 [Auschwitz] 


The spread of Christianity was greatly facilitated by the Pax Romano. Within 
three decades of Christ's crucifixion, Christian communities were established in 
most of the great cities of the eastern Mediterranean. St Paul, whose writings 
constitute the greater part of the New Testament, and whose journeys were the 
first pastoral visit of a Christian leader, was largely concerned with the Greek¬ 
speaking cities of the East. St Peter, Christ's closest disciple, is said to have 
sailed to Rome and to have been martyred there c. ad 68. From Rome, the 
gospel travelled to every province of the Empire, from Iberia to Armenia. 

The key figure was without doubt Saul of Tarsus (d. c.65), known as St Paul. 
Born a Jew and educated as a Pharisee, he took part in early Jewish persecutions 
of Christ's followers. He was present at the stoning of the first Christian martyr, 
Stephen, in Jerusalem c.35. But then, after his sudden conversion on the road to 
Damascus, he received baptism and became the most energetic proselyte of the 
New Way. His three missionary journeys were the single most important 
stimulus to its growth. He met with varying success. In Athens, in 53, where he 
found an altar 'To the Unknown God', he was received with hostility by the Jews 
and with suspicion by the Greeks: 


APOCALYPSE 

Patmos is Europe's last island, hard by the Aegean's Asian shore. In the 
first century ad it was used as a penal colony for the nearby Roman city of 
Ephesus. It was a fitting place to compose the last book of the canon of 
Christian scripture. 

The author of the Book of Revelation, the Apocalypse, was called John. 
He never claimed what later tradition assumed, that he was St John the 
Apostle; and neither his style nor his outlook matches those of the Fourth 





Gospel. He had been exiled for religious offences, and was probably writing 
between ad 81 and 96. 

The Apocalypse of St John the Divine records a series of mystical 
visions which, like Jewish apocalyptic literature of the same vintage, foretell 
the end of the existing order. The interpretation of its wondrous symbolism 
-of the Lamb, the Seven Seals, the Four Beasts and the Four Horsemen, the 
Great Whore of Babylon and the Red Dragon, and many more-has kept 
Christians puzzled and entranced ever since. The central chapters deal with 
the struggle with Anti-Christ, supplying a rich fund of demonology. 
[diabolos] The concluding section, chapters 21-2, presents a view of 'a new 
heaven and a new earth': 

'And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes: and there shall be no 
more death neither sorrow nor crying; neither shall there be any more pain: 
for the former things have passed away. 

And He that sat upon the throne said, Behold I make all things new. And 
He said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful. 

And He said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning 
and the end.' 1 (Rev. 21:4-6) 


Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans and the Stoics encountered him. And some said, What will this 
babbler say? other-some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange Gods: because he preached unto them 
Jesus and the resurrection. And they took him and brought him to Areopagus, saying May we know what 
this new doctrine... is?... For the Athenians... spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear 
some new thing. (Acts 17:18-21) 


He sojourned twice in more congenial company at Corinth, where he probably 
wrote the Epistle to the Romans. On returning to Jerusalem he was accused of 
transgressing the Jewish Law, but as a Roman citizen appealed for trial in Rome. 
He is generally thought to have perished in Rome during the persecutions of 
Nero. 

St Paul's contribution was crucial on two separate counts. On the one hand, 
as the Apostle of the Gentiles, he established the principle that the New Way was 
not the tribal preserve of Jews, that it was open to all comers. 'There shall be 
neither Jew nor Gentile, neither bond nor free.' On the other hand, he laid the 
foundations of all subsequent Christian theology. Sinful humanity is redeemed 




by Divine Grace through Christ, whose Resurrection abrogated the Old Law and 
ushered in the new era of the Spirit. Christ is more than the Messiah: He is the 
Son of God, identified with the Church in His mystical Body, which is shared by 
the faithful through Repentance and the Sacraments until the Second Coming. 
Jesus was uniquely the source of its inspiration; but it was St Paul who founded 
Christianity as a coherent religion, [chastity] 

The Jewish origins of Christianity have had lasting consequences, especially 
on relations between Christians and Jews. Following the Jewish Revolt of ad 70, 
the Jewish diaspora began to spread far and wide through the Empire. Judaism 
ceased to be concentrated in Judaea, and 'the People of the Book' became a 
religious minority in many parts of Europe and Asia. For them, Jesus Christ was 
a false messiah, a usurper, a renegade. For them, the Christians were a threat and 
a menace: dangerous rivals who had hijacked the scriptures and who broke the 
sacred taboos dividing Jew from Gentile. For the Christians, the Jews were also 
a threat and a challenge. They were Christ's own people who had none the less 
denied his divinity, and whose leaders had handed him over for execution. In 
popular legend, and eventually for a time in official theology, they became the 
'Christ-killers'. 

The schism within the Judaeo-Christian tradition has been generated on both 
sides by intense feelings of betrayal. It was inevitably more bitter than the 
conflicts of Christians with other religions. It is an unresolved, and unresolvable, 
quarrel within the family. From the hard-line Jewish perspective, Christianity is 
by nature antisemitic; and antisemitism is seen as a Christian phenomenon par 
excellence. From the hard-line Christian perspective, Judaism is by nature the 
seat of the antichrist, a bad loser, the perpetual source of smears, blasphemy, and 
insults. Notwithstanding the doctrine of forgiveness, it is the hardest thing in the 
world for Christians and Jews to see themselves as partners in the same tradition. 
Only the most Christian of Christians can contemplate calling the Jews 'our 
elder brethren'. 

Christianity, however, did not draw on Judaism alone. It was influenced by 
various oriental religions current in the Empire, and especially by Greek 
philosophy. The Gospel of St John, which begins 'In the beginning was the 
Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God', stands in marked 
contrast to the other three gospels, where this manifestly Greek doctrine of the 
Logos is not present. Modern scholars stress the hellenistic as well as the Judaic 
context. Philo of Alexandria, a hellenized Jew who sought to reconcile the 



Jewish scriptures with Platonism, holds a prominent place in this regard, 
[DIABOLOS] 


CHASTITY 

Chastity- in the sense of the permanent renunciation of sexual activity- 
was adopted by the early Christians as a central feature of their moral code. 
It was not unknown among the ancients, although Juvenal hinted that it had 
not been seen since 'Saturn filled the throne'. It was practised by pagan 
priestesses, such as the vestal virgins of Rome, on pain of death, and in the 
Jewish world by some of the all-male sects. But it had never been upheld as 
a universal ideal. 

Indeed, the wholesale pursuit of the virgin life had serious social 
implications. It threatened the family, the most respected institution of 
Roman life, and it undermined marriage. In a world where infant mortality 
was high, and average life expectancy did not exceed 25 years, the average 
household needed five pregnancies from each of its adult women to maintain 
numbers. Celibacy among adults seriously endangered the reproduction of 
the species. 

Yet the Christians cherished chastity with unremitting ardour. From St 
Paul onwards, they increasingly condemned the 'bondage of the flesh'. 'For 
I delight in the law of God after the inward man,' wrote St Paul. 'But I see 
another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and 
bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members For to 
be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.' 1 

The appeal of these Pauline teachings can only be partly explained in 
terms of the life of the spirit demanding freedom from all worldly 
preoccupations. The belief in the imminence of the 'Second Coming' may 
also have played a part, since it was thought to have rendered procreation 
superfluous. Sexual orgasm was condemned because it involved the ultimate 
loss of free will. Many people believed that the character of a child was 
determined by the parents' humour during intercourse. This created further 
inhibitions, since lovers would fear that impure sexual feelings might deform 
their offspring. Galen reports an erroneous medical notion to the effect that 




semen was produced from the froth of agitated blood. For men, sex was 
linked with physical as well as with spiritual disorder. For women, lifelong 
virginity was seen as the surest means of liberation from the tyranny of 
husbands and of traditional domestic duties. In general, therefore, sex was 
seen to be the mechanism whereby 'the sins of the fathers' were transmitted 
from generation to generation. 

In August 386 there occurred in Milan one of the most famous 
conversions of a self-confessed fornicator. St Augustine's Confessions 
provide a vital insight into the considerations involved in his acceptance of 
chastity. By that time, however, three hundred years had passed since St 
Paul. Established Christian communities were feeling the need to multiply. 

Hence the secondary ideal of Christian marriage was revived alongside 
the primary ideal of Christian chastity. In this, marriage officially remained a 
stop-gap measure, a guard against lust and fornication for those too weak to 
abstain. 'For it is better to marry', St Paul had written to the Christians of 
Corinth, 'than to burn.' 2 

This 'rout of the body' continued to hold sway in the Middle Ages. The 
secular Latin clergy joined the monks in celibacy. The 'Virgin Saints' were 
universally revered. The cult of the Virgin Mary, immaculate 
notwithstanding both conception and childbirth, was given a status similar to 
that accorded to the creed of the Trinity. Christian ascetics practised every 
form of mental and physical restraint, self-castration not excepted. 

The history of chastity is one of those topics in the study of Mentantes 
which best help modern readers to penetrate the mind of the ancients. It 
serves as a point of entry to what has been called 'a long extinct and deeply 
reticent world'. The magisterial study, which traces the debates on chastity 
among the Church Fathers of both Greek and Latin traditions, does not 
comment on present-day sexual attitudes, which the early Christians must 
surely have seen as a form of tyranny. But it undertakes the task of every 
good historian-to signal the differences between the past and the present, 
where chastity, to borrow a phrase, is often seen as the most unnatural of 
sexual perversions. 'To modern persons', Peter Brown concludes, '... the 
early Christian themes of sexual renunciation, continence, celibacy and the 
virgin life have come to carry with them icy overtones... . Whether they say 
anything of help or comfort for our own times, the readers ... must decide 
for themselves.' 3

The most recent research tends to suggest that Christianity and Judaism did 
not completely part company for perhaps two centuries. For many decades, the 
two overlapping communities may have shared the same messianic hopes. 
Judaic texts from the period 200 bc-ad 50, located in newly released sections of 
the Dead Sea Scrolls, bear a striking resemblance to the Christian gospels. One 
assessment maintains that the final break between Christians and Jews occurred 
in ad 131, when the leader of the second Jewish revolt against Rome, Simon 

Bar-Kokhba, proclaimed himself the Messiah, thereby severing the bond.- 
[PASCHA] 

Whatever the date of the final split, the Jewish presence alongside 
Christianity has never been extinguished. Every week for two millennia, the 
celebration of the Jewish Sabbath on Friday evening has always preceded the 
Christian Sabbath on Sundays. After the lighting of the candles and the prayers 
for peace, the service culminates in the opening of the Ark of the Covenant and a 
reading from the Book of the Law, the Torah: 


The Ark is Opened 


The Torah is a tree of life to those 

who hold it fast, and those who 
cling to it are blessed. Its ways 
are ways of pleasantness, and all 
its paths are peace.

Early Christianity had many rivals. In the first two centuries of the Empire 
the mystery cults of Isis, Cybele, and the Persian sun-god Mithras were thriving. 
They shared several important traits with early Christianity, including the 
ecstatic union with the divinity, the concept of a personal Saviour or Lord, and 
initiation rites akin to baptism. The anthropological approach to religion would 
stress these similarities. 

Gnosticism, too, had much in common with Christianity. In origin the 
Gnostics were philosophers, 'seekers after knowledge', but they attracted a 
following of a more religious character. They borrowed heavily from both 
Judaism and increasingly from Christianity, to the point where they were 
sometimes regarded as a Christian sect. They held to a distinction between the 
Creator or Demiurge, who was responsible for an evil world, and the Supreme 
Being; also, in the nature of Man, to a distinction between his vile, physical 
existence and the spark of divine essence which gives people the capacity to 
reach for the heavenly spheres. Simon Magus is mentioned in the New 
Testament. Valentinus was active in Rome, c. 136-65, Basilides in Alexandria. 
Marcion (d. 160) founded a gnostic sect that lasted until the fifth century. He 
taught that Christ's body was not real, and hence that the Resurrection could not 
have taken place in any physical sense; and he rejected the Old Testament, 
holding that the Jewish Jehovah was incomplete without the God of Love as 
revealed by Jesus. This 'Docetism' launched the long-running christological 
debate about the true nature of Christ. 

The disputes between Christians and Gnostics revealed the need for a 
recognized canon of scripture. Which of the holy writings were God-given, and 
which were merely man-made? This question preoccupied Christians at the turn 
of the second and third centuries, though the definitive statement was not made 
until the Festal Letter of Athanasius in 367. The core of the New Testament- 
the four Gospels and the 13 letters of St Paul-was accepted c.130, and the Old 
Testament-that is, the Hebrew canon less the Apocrypha-c.220. Other books, 

especially the Apocalypse or Revelation, were disputed much longer.

PASCHA 




Easter is the prime festival of the Christian calendar. It celebrates Christ's 
resurrection from the dead. It is preceded by the forty days of the Lenten 
fast, and culminates in the eight days of Holy Week, starting on Palm 
Sunday. It reaches its most sombre point during Passiontide, which begins at 
the hour of the Crucifixion at noon on Good Friday, only to erupt in an 
outburst of joy on the Third Day, on Easter Morning, when the Tomb was 
found empty. 

In most European languages Easter is called by some variant of the late 
Latin word Pascha, which in turn derives from the Hebrew pesach, 
'passover'. In Spanish it is Pascua, in French Paques, in Welsh Pasg, in 
Swedish Pask, in Russian and Greek Paskha. In German, however, it is 
Ostern, which derives, like its English equivalent, from the ancient 
Germanic goddess of springtime Eostro (Ostara). From this it appears that 
the Christians adapted earlier spring festivals marking the renewal of life 
after winter. They also appropriated the Jewish symbolism of Passover, with 
the crucified Christ becoming the 'Paschal Lamb'. 

The difference in names also recalls ancient controversies over the date 
of Easter. Those early Christians who followed the practices of the Jewish 
Passover fixed Easter on the fourteenth day of the moon following the vernal 
equinox. In 325 the Council of Nicaea decided that Easter day should fall on 
the first Sunday after the full moon following the vernal equinox. 

But the matter could not rest there, since several rival astronomical 
cycles were in existence for calculating solar years and lunations. Originally 
the great observatory at Alexandria was charged with the mathematics; but 
soon important discrepancies crept in between the Greek and Latin 
Churches, and between different provinces within the Latin Church. In 387 
Easter was held in Gaul on 21 March, in Italy on 18 April, and in Egypt on 
25 April. Subsequent attempts at standardization succeeded only partially, 
though 21 March and 25 April have remained the extreme limits. The 
Orthodox and Catholic Easters were never harmonized. Since Easter is a 
movable feast, all other festivals in the annual Christian calendar which 
depend on it, from Whitsun (Pentecost) to Ascension Day must move with 
it. 1 Easter finds no mention in the Bible, except for an isolated mistranslation 
in the English Authorized Version of 1613 where, in Acts 12: 4, 'Easter' 
appears in place of 'Passover'. 



For nearly two millennia Christendom has resounded at Easter-time to 
triumphal hymns about Christ's 'victory over Death'. For non-Christians 
these hymns can sound threatening. For the faithful, they express the deepest 
sense of their existence. The ancients sang the fourth-century Aurora Lucis 
rutilat ('The day draws on with golden light'), Finita iam sunt proelia ('The 
strife is o'er, the battle done' or Victimae Paschali Laudes). The best known 
Easter hymns, including Salve, festa dies ('Welcome, happy including Salve, 
festa dies ('Welcome, happy morning"), Vexilia regis ('The royal banners 
forward go'), and Pange lingua gloriosi proelium certaminis ('Sing, my 
tongue, the glorious battle') were composed by Venantius Fortunatus (c.530- 
610), sometime Bishop of Poitiers. The best Greek counterparts, such as 
Anastaseos Imera ('The day of resurrection'), sometimes sung to the melody 
of 'Lancashire', were composed by St John of Damascus (c.675-749). 
Germans sing the Jesus lebt! of Christian Furchtegott Gellert; the French, A 
Toi la gloire, O resuscitel; the Poles, Chrystus zmartwychstan jest; the 
Greeks, Hristos Anestil The English-speaking world sings 'Christ the Lord is 
risen today' to words by Charles Wesley: 

Vain the Stone, the watch, the seal; 

Christ has burst the gates of hell. 

Death in vain forbids his rise. 

Christ has opened Paradise. 

Lives again our Glorious King; 

Where, O Death, is now thy sting? 

Once he died, our souls to save; 

Where thy victory, O grave? 

Hallelujahl 2 


DIABOLOS 

All the main traditions from which European civilization was fused were 
strongly conscious of the Evil One. In prehistoric religion, as in pagan 
folklore, he often took the form of a horned animal-the dragon, the serpent, 




the goat-man of the witches' sabbath, the seductive Gentleman who could 
not quite conceal his horns, his tail, and his hooves. In classical mythology 
he was a lord of the underworld, with a pedigree that can be traced to the 
encounter of Gilgamesh with Huwawa. [epic] In the Manichean tradition 
[bogumil], he was the Prince of Darkness. To Aristotle, he may have been 
no more than the absence of the Good. But to the Platonists, he was already 
the diabolos, the opponent, the Old Enemy. In the Old Testament, especially 
in the Book of Job, he was the agent of sin and inexplicable suffering. In 
Christian lore, the tempter of Christ in the wilderness becomes the Satan and 
the Lucifer of the Fall. He finds a central place in medieval demonology and 
in St Augustine's discussion of free will and of God's licence for evil, as in 
the master-works of Milton and Goethe. In recent times Europeans have 
dropped their guard. But a history of Europe without the Devil would be as 
odd as an account of Christendom without Christ. 1 


Theological disputes foreshadowed the need for some form of ecclesiastical 
authority to resolve them. One solution was provided by Clement of Rome (d. 
c.90), who furthered the doctrine of the apostolic succession. Christian leaders 
had authority if they could trace their appointment to one of the twelve apostles, 
or to the apostles' recognized successors. Clement himself, who was probably 
third in line to St Peter as 'bishop' at Rome, based his own claim on the text 
Thou art Peter, and on this rock I shall build my church'. The same point was 
made with greater force by Bishop Irenaeus of Lyons (c. 130-200), in his 
writings against the Gnostics: 

The greatest and most ancient of churches, known to all, [is that] established at 
Rome by the apostles Peter and Paul... Every other church, that is, the faithful 
from all other parts, ought to be harmonized [with Rome], by virtue of the 
authority of its origins. And it is there that Tradition, derived from the apostles, 
has been preserved.. .- 

Here already was the essence of the Roman Catholic tradition. (See 
Appendix III, p. 1224.) 

For the time being, several competing authorities prevailed, and the apostolic 
succession, as interpreted in Rome, never gained universal acceptance. Direct 
contact with Christ's apostles, however, obviously carried kudos. Apart from St 





Clement, the Apostolic Fathers included Ignatius of Antioch, Papias of 
Hierapolis, and St Polycarp of Smyrna (c.69-155), who was burned at the stake. 

The persecution of early Christians is a matter of some controversy, and its 
true extent cannot be disentangled from the martyrology of the most interested 
party. 'The ecclesiastical writers of the fourth and fifth centuries', wrote Gibbon, 
'ascribed to the magistrates of Rome the same degree of implacable and 
unrelenting zeal which filled their own breasts.'- Still, fitful repressions did 
occur. Nero made Christians into scapegoats for the great fire of Rome in 64. 
This was contrary to the general toleration extended to national cults, such as 
Judaism, to which Christianity was judged to belong. Domitian, who demanded 
that he be worshipped as Dominus et Deus, executed Christian recalcitrants for 
'atheism'. Marcus Aurelius sanctioned a severe repression at Lyons in 177. But 
it was not until 250 that the Emperor Decius (249-51) ordered that all his 
subjects sacrifice to the state gods on pain of death. After another interval, 
Diocletian ordered in 303 that all Christian churches be destroyed and all bibles 
burnt. This Great Persecution lasted thirteen years, and was the prelude to the 
general toleration proclaimed in the following reign. Excessive repression had 
proved counterproductive. The Roman Empire's surrender to Christianity was 
irrigated by the blood of martyrs, [catacombi] 

The growth of clergy-as a separate estate from the laity-seems to have 
been a gradual matter. The offices of Episcopos or 'bishop' as communal leader, 
and of diaconus or 'deacon', preceded that of the presbyter or 'priest' with 
exclusive sacerdotal functions. The title of Patriarch, the 'Father' of the bishops 
in any particular province or country, was long used very inconsistently. No 
special status was accorded to the bishop of Rome. The prestige which accrued 
from leading the Christian community in the capital of the Empire was 
diminished when the imperial government ceased to reside there. And it exposed 
the Christians of Rome to greater persecution. Throughout the early centuries 
there was a line of bishops on the 'throne of St Peter'; but they did not emerge as 
a leading force in the Church until the fifth or, some might reckon, the seventh 
century. 


CATACOMBI 





Belief in the resurrection of the dead gave burial a special role in the early 
Christian community; and two miles beyond Rome's Aurelian Walls, in the 
vicinity of the Appian Way, lay a district, Ad Catacumbas, where for safety 
early Christians buried their dead in underground galleries. Forty-two such 
catacombs have been identified since their rediscovery in the sixteenth 
century, each of them a warren of tunnels on five or six levels linking the 
maze of chambers and family loculi or 'notches'. The earliest tombs, such as 
that of Flavia Domitilla, wife of the consul for ad 95, date from the end of 
the first century. But the greatest number date from the era of persecutions in 
the third century. The catacombs were never lived in; but later, under 
Christian rule, they became a favourite meeting-ground, where festivals 
were held and chapels built in honour of the popes and martyrs. Most of the 
inscriptions were cut at that time. For example, in the Catacomb of 
Praetextus, there is an inscription to one of Pope Sixtus' martyred deacons, 
St lanuarius, arrested with him on 6 August 258: BEATISSIMO MARTYRI 
IANUARIO DAMASUS EPISCOP FECIT (Bishop Damasus made [this 
monument dedicated] to the Blessed Martyr lanuarius). 

The largest complex, the Catacomb of St Callistus, was built by the ex¬ 
slave who became pope in 217-22. It includes the papal chamber, containing 
burials up to Pope Miltiades (d. 314), the crypt of St Cecilia, and in the 
Crypt of the Sacraments an extraordinary collection of mural paintings. 
Catacomb art was highly symbolic of the spiritual life and the world to 
come. Its favourite motifs included the dove, the anchor, the dolphin, the 
fisherman, the Good Shepherd, and Jonah, precursor of the Resurrection. 

Pillaging by Goths and Vandals in the fifth century caused many relics to 
be withdrawn to churches within the city; and the postponement of the 
Second Coming caused the gradual abandonment of underground burial. St 
Sebastian's crypt was one of the few sites to remain frequented. It was 
sought out by medieval pilgrims seeking protection from the plague. 

Beside the Catacomb of Basileo stands a church which marks Rome's 
most famous Christian legend. Fleeing from persecution along the Appian 
Way, St Peter met Christ on the road and asked him Domine, quo vadis? 
(Lord, where are you going?) Christ answered, 'To Rome, for a second 
crucifixion.' Peter turned back, and was martyred. 

Three of the forty-two catacombs-at Villa Torlonia, at Vigna Randatini, 



and at Monte Verde-are Jewish. 1 


The 'Fathers of the Church' is a collective label which was used from the 
fourth century onwards for the Christian leaders of the preceding period. The 
Apologists, from Aristides of Athens to Tertullian (155-255), clarified what 
ultimately became orthodox beliefs. Others, including Hippolytus (165-236), 
Clement of Alexandria (c.150-215), Origen (185-250), and Cyprian of Carthage 
(d. 258), were revered for their defence of the faith against pagans and heretics. 
The body of Patristics or 'writings of the Fathers' is not judged to end before 
those of St John Chrysostom (347-407). 

Heresy, of course, is a tendentious concept. It is an accusation levelled by 
one group of believers against another; and it can only exist if the accusers 
believe in their own dogmatic monopoly of the truth. In Christian history, it only 
emerges in the second and third centuries as the general consensus solidified. 
Most of the Church's Fathers were heretical in varying degrees. The chief 
heresies, as defined by later orthodoxy, included Docetism, Montanism, 
Novatianism, Apollinarianism, Nestorianism, Eutychianism, Arianism, 
Pelagianism, Donatism, Monophysitism, and Monothelitism. Of these, Arianism 
was specially important because it won the adherence of many communities both 
inside and outside the Empire. Founded by Arius (c.250-336), a priest of 
Alexandria, it held that Christ, as Son of God, could not share the full divinity of 
God the Father. It provoked the first ecumenical Council of the Church, where it 
was condemned. But it re-emerged through the support of the Emperor 
Constantius II, and its acceptance by several barbarian peoples, notably the 
Goths. It even split into three main sub-heresies: the Anomoeans, the Homoeans, 
and the Semi-Arians. It did not die out until the sixth century, [brito] 

Christian monasticism was entirely oriental in its beginnings. St Antony of 
the Desert (c.251-356), an opponent of Arius and founder of the first anchorite 
community, was yet another Alexandrian. 

The Christian concepts and practices, therefore, which in due course were 
pronounced Catholic (universal) and orthodox (correct) were the fruit of many 
years of debate and dispute. Their final definition awaited the work of four 
Doctors of the Church, who were active in the late fourth century-SS Martin, 
Jerome, Ambrose, and Augustine. Apart from the debate on the Logos, which 
soon gave precedence to the christological issue, they centred on the doctrines of 




Grace, Atonement, and the Church; on the Sacraments, Baptism and Eucharist; 
and above all on the Trinity. In 325, when the Emperor Constantine convened 
the first General Council of the Church at Nicaea in Asia Minor, the 300 
delegates were asked to summarize the articles of basic Christian belief. They 
were dominated by the party from Alexandria, especially by the anti-Arian or 
Trinitarian group led by Athanasius (c.296-373). There were only a handful of 
bishops from the West, including Cordoba and Lyons. The absent Bishop of 
Rome, Sylvester I, was represented by two legates. What they produced was a 
combination of a baptismal formula used in Jerusalem with the famous idea of 
homoousios or 'consubstan-tiality'. The Nicene Creed has been binding on all 
Christians ever since: 

We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, 

Maker of all things both visible and invisible; 

And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, 

Begotten of the Father, Only-begotten, 

That is, of one substance with the Father; 

By whom all things both in heaven and earth were made; 

Who for us men and our salvation 
Came down and was incarnate, became man, 

Suffered and rose again the third day; 

Ascended into the heavens; 

Cometh to judge the quick and the dead; 

And in the Holy Spirit.- 

It was three hundred years since Christ had walked in Galilee. 

The Bosporus, 4 November 1079 auc. Shortly after ordering the execution of 
his heir apparent, the Emperor Constantine conducted a ceremony to mark the 
foundation of his new capital city. He laid the first stone of the western wall, at 
the point where it meets the sea. He was attended by the neoplatonist 
philosopher Sopater, who was acting as telestes or 'magician 5 and who cast the 
spells to secure the city's good fortune. Also present was Praetestatus, a pontifex 
from Rome, who was said to have brought the most sacred of Roman talismans, 
the Palladium, to be buried at the base of the founder's statue in the new forum. 
The sun was in the sign of Sagittarius, but the Crab ruled the hour.'- 

Four years later, on 11 May 1083 (ad 330), fresh ceremonies inaugurated the 


life of the new foundation. Shortly after the execution of Sopater, and of another 
pagan philosopher, Canonaris, who had shouted out: 'Do not raise yourself 
against our ancestors', Constantine presided at a grand inaugural festival. The 
city was officially named 'Constantinopolis' and 'Roma Nova'. Prayers to the 
goddess Tyche, or 'Fortune', the city's tutelary genius, mingled with the 
Christian chant of kyrie eleison. In the Circus, by the Temple of Castor and 
Pollux, sumptuous games were held, but no gladiatorial contests. In the Forum, 
the oversize statue of the Emperor was unveiled. It had been made by mounting 
Constantine's head on an ancient Colossus of Apollo, and it stood on a huge 
porphyry column. In all probability, a smaller gilded statue of Constantine, 
carrying a tiny Tyche on its outstretched hand, was paraded in torchlight 
procession. Certainly a procession of that sort soon became an annual tradition 
in Constantinople on Founder's Day. The Tyche carried a Cross welded to her 
forehead. All subsequent emperors were expected to rise and to prostrate 
themselves before it. New coins and medals were struck: they carried the bust of 
Constantine, and the inscription totius orbis imperator. 



The choice of the city's site had not been easily decided. The Emperor 
needed a capital that would benefit from the sea routes through the Bosporus and 




Hellespont. He had first looked at ancient Chalcedon on the Asian shore. Then 
he went for ancient Ilium (Troy), whose legendary connections with the 
founding of Rome offered important symbolic advantages. He visited the Trojan 
Fields, and marked out the outlines of a future city at a place revered as Hector's 
Grave. The gates had already been erected (they can still be seen), before he 
changed his mind once again, crossing the water to the small town of Byzantium 
on the European shore, where he had recently conducted a victorious siege. At 
last, both the practicalities and the auguries were right. Later legend held that 
Constantine traced the line of the walls in person. Striding out in front of the 
surveyors, spear in hand, he left his companions far behind. When one of them 
called out, 'How much further, Sire?', he is said to have replied mysteriously, 
'Until He who walks before me stops walking.' 

The transformation of little Byzantium into Constantinople the Great 
required works of immense size and speed. Constantine's Wall ran across the 
peninsula from the Golden Horn to the Sea of Marmora, some two miles to the 
west of the ancient acropolis. Constantine's Forum was built immediately 
outside Byzantium's older wall. The separate suburbs of Sycae (Galata) and of 
Blachernae, on opposing sides of the Golden Horn, received separate 
fortifications; whilst much of the old city was stripped or demolished. The 
graceful granite column of Claudius Gothicus, erected in ad 269 after a famous 
victory, was left on the point of the promontory, looking out over the sea to Asia. 
Constantinople, like Rome, contained seven hills, which were soon to be covered 
with public and private buildings. Eighty years later, a description mentions a 
Capitol or school of learning, a Circus, two theatres, eight public and 153 private 
baths, 52 porticoes, five granaries, eight aqueducts, four meeting-halls, fourteen 
churches, fourteen palaces, and 4,388 listed residences of outstanding 
architectural merit. To adorn this megalopolis, vast numbers of art treasures were 
brought from Greece-the Pythian Apollo, the Samian Hera, the Olympian 
[zeus], the Pallas of Rhodian Lindos. Four hundred and twenty-seven statues 
were assembled to stand in front of Saint Sophia alone. Colonists were forcibly 
imported from all the neighbouring settlements. In order to feed them, and to 
supply the annual dole, the grain fleets of Egypt, Syria, and Asia Minor were 
redirected. Constantinople had to be launched in record time; its neighbours 
were vandalized, emptied, and starved. 

The character of Constantine has attracted much speculation. As the first 
Christian emperor, he became the subject of shameless hagiography. 'Speech and 
reason stand mute', wrote Eusebius of Caesarea, the first biographer, 'when I 



gaze in spirit upon this thrice-blessed soul, united with God, free of all mortal 
dross, in robes gleaming like lightning, and in ever radiant diadem.'- Yet to his 
detractors he was an odious hypocrite, a tyrant and murderer, whose reputation 
was only burnished by a deathbed conversion and by the forgeries of the 
subsequent era. Gibbon, who was allergic to Christian legends, none the less 
preferred a generous interpretation, stressing talents marred only by the 
extravagances of his old age. Constantine was 'tall and majestic, dexterous ... 
intrepid in war, affable in peace ... and tempered by habitual prudence ... He 
deserved the appellation of the first Emperor who publicly professed the 
Christian religion.'- 

Despite his mother's example, it is a moot point how far Constantine was a 
practising Christian. He publicly confessed his debt to the One God; but most of 
his actions, including the Edict of Toleration, could equally be explained by the 
policy of a tolerant pagan. During the festivities at Constantinople, he was most 
interested in promoting the worship of himself. At the same time, he was a 
devoted patron of church-building, not least in Rome, where both St Peter's and 
the Basilica Constantiniana (St John Lateran) were his foundations. In 321 he 
enforced the general observance of Sunday as a day of rest. As was common, he 
long deferred his formal baptism, being christened by Bishop Eusebius of 
Nicomedia, an Arian, on his deathbed. He gave no special favours to the Bishop 
of Rome. Constantine basked in the deepening theatricality of the late imperial 
cult. As the Sol Invictus (the Unconquered Sun), he inherited Diocletian's 
practice of the adorado purpurae, the adoration of the purple, and he surrounded 
himself with the obsequious language of oriental despotism. Public art, as 
illustrated on the friezes of the Arch of Constantine in Rome, was growing more 
stiff and formal. Intellectual life at Constantine's court was dominated by the 
drive to reconcile the rising tide of Christianity with traditional culture. 
Constantine relied on the convert rhetorician Lactantius, whom he had known at 
Trier, both to teach his son Crispus and, in the Divinae Insdtutiones, to set out a 
systematic account of the Christian world view. 

The state of the Christian religion in Constantine's reign must be nicely 
gauged. After the Edict of Milan (313) the Church benefited from official 
toleration and a stable revenue and, with the Nicene Creed, from a coherent 
doctrine. Yet it was still little more than a minority sect in the early stages of 
institutional growth. There was no supreme ecclesiastical authority. The 
scriptural canon was not fully agreed. None of the greatest of the Church 


Fathers, from John Chrysostom to Augustine, had yet been born. The greatest of 
the heresiarchs, Arius, enjoyed considerable influence at the imperial court, 
being recalled from exile in 334. Indeed, Arianism was destined to become 
dominant in the succeeding reign. The Donatists in Africa had recently been 
suppressed. The only countries where Christianity was growing beyond the 
Empire were Armenia and Abyssinia. The age of sporadic persecutions was past; 
but 'the divisions of Christendom suspended the ruin of Paganism'. 

In 330 the Empire was in healthier shape than for many decades. East and 
West had been reunited. The general peace held. Constantine's reforms have 
been dismissed as 'a timid policy, of dividing whatever is united, of reducing 
whatever is eminent, of dreading every active power, of expecting that the most 
feeble will prove the most obedient'. At least they gave the Empire a breathing 
space. The army was brought under control by dividing the jurisdiction of the 
praetorian prefects into rival masterships of cavalry and infantry; by 
distinguishing the elite palatine troops from the second-rate forces on the 
frontier; and by the widespread introduction of barbarian officers and auxiliaries. 
The Emperor's lavish building projects, and his repair of the road and postal 
system, was paid for by an oppressive land tax. A far-flung network of imperial 
messengers, who acted as official spies, kept potential opponents in fear. 

Constantine had no plan for avoiding the perennial problems of succession. 
He had killed his eldest son, Crispus, on rumours of a Roman plot. But this still 
left him with three more sons-Constantine, Constantius, and Constans-a 
favoured nephew, and three brothers. Two years before his death he divided the 
Empire between them, raising his sons to the rank of Caesar. They ill repaid his 
generosity. Constantine II was killed whilst invading the territory of Constans. 
Constans was killed by the usurper, Maxentius. Constantius II, having initiated a 
massacre of his remaining relatives, was left to win the Empire from Maxentius. 

Following the chaos of the previous century, the economy of the Empire was 
restored to a modicum of prosperity and stability. Civic munificence was 
diminished from earlier levels; but provincial cities, especially on the frontier 
zones of central Europe, retained a solid measure of pride in their public works. 
Diocletian's tax reforms, based on assessments of agricultural labour, had 
provided the basis for regular budgetary planning. They also swelled the 
imperial bureaucracy. Complaints were heard about tax-collectors outnumbering 
tax-payers. The gold coinage, struck at the rate of 60 coins per pound of bullion, 
offset the debasement of copper coins and laid the foundations of Byzantium's 



stable currency. 

The Empire's frontiers were holding firm; in fact, for a time they were 
slightly expanded. The valuable province of Armenia had been wrested from 
Persia in 297, and through romanization and Christianization was laying the basis 
of a permanent and distinctive culture. To facilitate administration, the Empire 
was divided into the four prefectures of Oriens (Constantinople), Illyricum 
(Sirmium), Italia et Africa (Milan), and Gaul (Trier). In the West, in Britain, the 
depredations of the Piets and Scots had been held at bay by the expedition of 
Constantine's father. The separatist 'emperors of Britain', Carausius and Alectus, 
had been brought to heel. In the East, Sassanid Persia threatened, but did not 
overrun. In the south, Moorish tribes were pressing on Roman Africa. 

The most important changes to Europe's political and ethnic map were 
proceeding beyond the Empire's limits and beyond the reach of documentary 
history. The huge region of Celtic supremacy was dwindling fast. The Celts' 
western strongholds in Britain and Gaul were heavily romanized. Their 
homelands in the centre were being overrun, absorbed, or destroyed by the 
movement of Germanic and Slavonic tribes (see Chapter IV). The Franks were 
already settled on either side of the Rhine frontier. The Goths had completed 
their Long March from the Vistula to the Dnieper. The Slavs were drifting 
westwards towards the centre, where Celtic Bohemia was heading for 
slavicization. The Baits already lived on the Baltic. The Finno-Ugrians, long 
since divided, were well on their way to their future territories. The Finns were 
on station on the Volga-Baltic bridge; the Magyars were settled at one of their 
many halts along the southern steppes. The nomads and the sea-raiders remained 
for the time being along the outer periphery. The Scythians were no. more than a 
distant memory. The Huns were still in Central Asia. The Norsemen were 
already in Norway, as shown by the oldest of their runic inscriptions. 

Constantine's view of the outside world would have been governed by the 
state of Roman communications. China, which was still disunited by the chaos 
of the recent 'Three Kingdom Period', was known through the fragile contacts of 
the silk route. It had been visited in ad 284 by the ambassadors of Diocletian. It 
was nominally subject to the Chin dynasty, whose influence was slowly 
spreading from north to south. It had largely abandoned the philosophy of 
Confucius and, through the flowering of Buddhism, was building strong cultural 
ties with India. India, whose northern region had just come under the rule of the 
Gupta emperors, the greatest patrons of Hindu art and culture, was much closer 



to Rome and was much better known. News of the crowning of Chandragupta I 
at Magadha in 320 would almost certainly have reached Constantinople via 
Egypt. Egypt was also the source of news from Abyssinia, which was the target 
of Christian missions from Syria and Alexandria. The Sassanid Empire of Persia, 
which shared a long and fragile frontier with Rome, was the object of intense 
interest. It had rejected the hellenism of the previous era and passed into a phase 
of militant Zoroastrianism. Mani, the prophet of dualist Manichaeanism, who 
had sought to marry Zoroaster's principles with those of Christianity, had been 
executed some sixty years before. The boy-king Shapur II (310-79) was still in 
the power of his priests and magnatial guardians, who, apart from completing the 
compilation of the holy scriptures, the Avesta were conducting a thorough 
persecution of all dissenters. The Roman-Persian peace, which had not been 
broken for thirty-three years, was due to hold until Constantine's death. 

The founding of Constantinople in 330, which was a clear-cut event, seems to 
support the widespread practice of taking the reign of Constantine as the 
dividing line between the ancient and the medieval periods. In this, it has to vie 
with a number of competing dates: with 392 and the accession of Theodosius I, 
the first emperor whose empire was exclusively Christian; with 476 and the 
collapse of the Roman Empire in the West (see p. 240); with 622 and the rise of 
Islam, which divided the former Roman world into Muslim and Christian 
spheres (see pp. 251-8); and with 800 and Charlemagne's restoration of a 
Christian empire in the West (see pp. 298-306). If this sort of dividing line were 
to be taken seriously, there is a danger that the young Constantine might be 
judged an ancient and the older Constantine a medieval. 

Much more important is the overall balance at any given time between the 
legacy of the past and the sum total of innovations-what professional historians 
sometimes call the 'continuities' and the 'discontinuities'. On this basis, one can 
state with some confidence that no such tipping of an important balance occurred 
in Constantinople in ad 330. 

The city of Rome was inevitably diminished, not least when Constantine 
abolished the praetorian guard and razed their Roman headquarters. But Rome's 
practical importance had declined long since. In the long run it actually 
benefited: by losing control of an empire which was set to crumble, it ensured 
that it would not be linked to the Empire's fate. It was to find a new and lasting 
role as the home of Christianity's most powerful hierarch. The current Bishop of 



Rome, however, was far from assertive. Sylvester I (314-35) attended neither the 
Council of Aries, which Constantine convened in 314 to end the Donatist 
quarrel, nor the General Council of Nicaea. 

Most historians would agree that the core of Graeco-Roman civilization, as 
solidified in the later phases of the ancient world, lay first and foremost in the 
Empire and secondly in the complex cultural pluralism which it patronized and 
tolerated. The core of medieval civilization, in contrast, lay in the community of 
Christendom and its exclusively Christian culture. It developed through the 
mingling of ex-Roman and non-Roman peoples on a territorial base that 
coincided with that of the former Empire only in part. In 330, very few of the 
processes which led from the one to the other had even begun. Constantine 
himself was no European. 

One must not forget the sequence of events. The span of time which 
separated Constantine from Charlemagne was greater than that which separated 
Constantine from Caesar and Augustus. It was equal to the span which 
encompasses the whole of modern history, from the Renaissance and 
Reformation to the present. 

Yet Constantine did plant the seed of one historic notion-that the Christian 
religion was compatible with politics. Christ himself had categorically rejected 
political involvement; and prior to Constantine, Christians had not sought to 
assume power as a means of furthering their cause. After Constantine, 
Christianity and high politics went hand in hand. This, in the eyes of the purists, 
was the moment of corruption. 

Appropriately enough, therefore, Constantinople soon became the founding 
seat of Christian power. It was made the official capital of the Roman Empire in 
331, on the first anniversary of its inauguration, and it retained the distinction for 
more than a thousand years. Within one or two generations it assumed a 
predominantly Christian character, with the churches outnumbering the temples, 
until the temples were eventually banned. It was the source, and later the heart, 
of the 'Byzantine' state-the senior branch of medieval Christendom, and, 
despite the devotees of 'Western Civilization', an essential constituent of 
European history. 



IV 


ORIGO 

The Birth of Europe, AD c .330-800 


There is a sense of impending doom about most modern attempts to describe the 
late Roman Empire. The fact of the Empire's decline and fall is known in 
advance to virtually everyone, and it is all but impossible to recreate the 
perspectives of those long centuries when the eventual outcome was a mystery. 
Voltaire dismissed the history of the late Empire as 'ridiculous'; Gibbon wrote 
that he had described 'the triumph of barbarism and religion'. 

Yet contemporaries could hardly have shared the viewpoint of the 
Enlightenment. True enough, they were very conscious of living through 
difficult times. Nothing is more redolent of the age than the melancholy 
reflections of the late Roman philosopher Boethius (c.480-525). 'The most 
unfortunate sort of misfortune', he wrote in his Consolations of Philosophy, 'is 
once to have been happy.' On the other hand, if they watched the Empire's 
decline, they did not necessarily foresee its fall. For many Christians, the end of 
the Empire came to be synonymous with Christ's Second Coming, with 
Doomsday itself. But Doomsday was so often postponed that it ceased to play a 
part in practical considerations. What is more, it is doubtful whether the 
barbarians, whose incursions were the most visible symptom of the Empire's 
weakness, had any intention of destroying it. On the contrary, they wanted to 
share in its benefits. The shocking sack of Rome in ad 410 occurred because the 
Emperor had refused to settle Alaric's Goths in the Empire. From the modern 






vantage-point, the real marvels to contemplate are the longevity of the Roman 
Empire, and the growing interdependence of the ex-Roman and the ex-barbarian 
worlds. In the long run, this was the interaction which gave birth to the entity 
called 'Christendom', the foundation of European civilization. 

At the death of Constantine, the division of the 'known world' into two 
simple parts, the Roman and the barbarian, generally still stood. On one side of 
the frontier the reunited Roman Empire held firm; on the other a restless mass of 
peoples, largely in the tribal stage of development, tilled the forest clearings or 
roamed the plain. Understandably enough, most Romans saw this division in 
terms of black and white. For them, the Empire was 'civilized'-that is, subject 
to ordered government; the barbarians were, by definition 'uncivilized'. Though 
the concept of the 'noble savage' certainly existed-as when the captive British 
chief, Caractacus, had been paraded through Rome-the crossing from the 
Empire to the uncharted lands beyond was seen as a step from sunlight into 
shade. 

In reality, the distinction between the Roman and the non-Roman world 
could never have been so stark. Roman armies regularly fought under barbarian 
generals, who used barbarian auxiliaries to help repel the Empire's barbarian 
foes. The countries adjacent to the frontier had been exposed to Roman influence 
for centuries. Roman traders and artefacts penetrated far beyond the imperial 
frontiers. Roman coins have been unearthed throughout Germany and eastern 
Europe. Hoards and graves have yielded stunning Roman gold, bronze, and 
silver ware, at Hildesheim near Hanover, at Lubsow in Pomerania, at Trondheim 
in Norway, at Klajpeda in Lithuania, even in Afghanistan. Important Roman 
trading-stations operated as far afield as south India.- 

It is equally hard to be precise about the tempo of the Roman Empire's 
decline. Three grand historical processes which begin to take centre stage after 
Constantine were already in motion; and each of them lasted for many centuries. 
The first was the relentless westward drive of the barbarian peoples from Asia 
into Europe (see pp. 215-38). The second was the growing rift between the 
Western and the Eastern halves of the Roman world (see pp. 239-51). The third 
was the steady export of Christianity to the pagan peoples (see pp. 275-82). 
These three processes dominated the period which were later to be dubbed 'the 
Dark Ages'. A fourth, the rise of Islam (see pp. 251-8), exploded out of distant 
Arabia in the seventh century, and rapidly set the southern and eastern limits 
within which the others could interact. 


For modern readers, one main problem lies with the traditional 
romanocentric and christianophile perceptions of European historians whose 
approach to 'the Dark Ages' has strongly reflected both their classical education 
and their religious beliefs. Of course, there is no reason why one should not put 
oneself in the shoes of a Boethius or a Gregory of Tours, and empathize with 
their gloomy judgements. If one does, the sense of impending doom can only be 
reinforced. On the other hand, there is no reason why one perspective should be 
accepted to the exclusion of all others. If only the sources were more abundant, 
one could empathize no less properly with the experiences of the advancing 
barbarians, of the pagans, or of the Muslim warriors. In which case the 
prevailing air would probably become one of excitement, of expectation, and of 
promise. According to Salvian of Marseilles, many Romans of good birth and 
education took refuge among the Goths and the Franks, 'seeking a Roman 
humanity among the barbarians, because they could no longer support barbarian 
inhumanity among the Romans 


- "• 


Migrations and Settlement 

In the early centuries of the first millennium, few parts of the Peninsula were 
inhabited by the peoples who would later settle there permanently in well- 
defined national 'homelands'. Much of the population beyond the Roman 
frontier was on the move. Tribes and federations of tribes, large and small, 
conducted an unending search for better land. From time to time the pace of their 
wanderings would be quickened by dearth, or by the violent arrival of nomadic 
horsemen, in which case, having tarried for decades or even centuries in one 
location, they would suddenly move on to the next. 

The irregular rhythms of migration depended on a complex equation 
involving climatic changes, food supply, demographic growth, local rivalries, 
distant crises. For the Romans watching anxiously on the frontier, they were 
entirely unpredictable. Pressures would accumulate imperceptibly, until some 
unforeseen event would snap the restraints. Long intervals of quiescence would 
alternate with short, intense surges. As always, the act of migration depended on 
the delicate balance between the forces of inertia, the 'push' of local difficulties, 
and the 'pull' of greener grass over the horizon. The critical cause of any 




particular displacement might lie far away on the steppes of central Asia; and a 
'shunting effect' is clearly observable. Changes at one end of the chain of 
peoples could set off ripples along all the links of the chain. Like the last wagon 
of a train in the shunting yards, the last tribe on the western end of the chain 
could be propelled from its resting-place with great force. 

In this regard, the Huns caused ripples in the West long before they 
themselves appeared. A Hunnic Empire had been destroyed by the Chinese 
c.36/35 bc. Thereafter the Hunnic hordes, and the herds of cattle from which 
they lived, were based in what is now Turkestan. Their raiding parties could 
easily cover a couple of thousand miles a month. Mounted on swift Mongolian 
ponies and armed with bows and arrows, they could ride deep into Europe or the 
Far East and return in the course of a single summer. Like all the true nomads, 
they generated a huge motive force on the agricultural or semi-nomadic peoples 
with whom they came into contact. In the second century ad their base shifted to 
the north of the Caspian Sea; in the fourth century it was shifting towards what is 
now Ukraine. There, in 375, they encountered the Ostrogoths, a Germanic 
people who, exceptionally, had been moving in the opposite direction. The 
resultant clash pushed the Ostrogoths, and the neighbouring Visigoths, into the 
Roman Empire. Within fifty years another of the associated tribes, the Alans, 
appeared in what is now southern Portugal-almost 3,000 miles away. The Huns 
did not attack the Empire themselves until 441. The rate of migration, of course, 
was extremely slow. The Alans, who crossed the Dnieper c.375 and the Rhine in 
406, and reached the Atlantic in the 420s, averaged perhaps 5 miles per year. 
The 'sudden irruption' of the Vandals, who shared part of the Alans' journey (see 
below), maintained a mean speed of 2 km per week. Tribal columns weighed 
down with carts, livestock, and supplies could not hope to compete with the 
nomads. 




Geographical considerations played a central role. The main obstacle to the 
free movement of peoples was not the imperial frontier but the mountains. All 
the tribes following the prehistoric trail across the Eurasian steppes, if they did 
not turn immediately south along the Black Sea shore, were automatically 
channelled to the north along the European plain. After that, there were only two 
possible southbound turns, through the Moravian or the Bavarian Gaps. To take 
the southerly route involved an early military confrontation with imperial forces 
on the Danube. To pass along the northerly route was to follow the line of least 
resistance, where inertia would carry the migrants direcdy to the Rhine. For 
these reasons, pressure steadily mounted on the Rhine barrier, until in the third 
and fourth centuries a veritable traffic jam of tribes was produced. The passage 
through the mountains into the Danube basin was impractical for the larger 
convoys. But it became the chosen route of the nomads; and the lush plains of 
Pannonia-later named 'Hungaria' after the Huns-formed their natural 
terminus. (See pp. 232, 296,316.) [csaba] 

Another obstacle lay with tribes that were blocking the path ahead. True 
enough, the Peninsula had many open spaces: the density of population was very 
low, even in the Empire. But much was wilderness. The dense forests, sandy 
heaths, and sodden valleys could neither be cultivated nor easily crossed; and the 
migrants had to compete for finite areas of cleared or cultivable land. It was 





difficult for the tribes to move without coming into contact, and potential 
conflict, with their predecessors on the trail. As a result, the bunching and 
mingling of tribes in some of the choicer locations of the European plain was 
inevitable. There is absolutely no reason to suppose that Celts, Germans, Slavs, 
and others did not overlap, and sometimes intermingle. The idea of exclusive 
national homelands is a modern fantasy. 

The fluidity of migrant tribal groupings, and the chaotic nature of their 
movements, did not suit the purposes of those who tried to make sense of the 
migrations in later times. Chroniclers and historians were tempted to write in 
terms of discrete, permanent, and self-conscious tribes where no such entities 
had necessarily existed. It is far from certain, for example, whether the Angles, 
Saxons, and Jutes who ended up in England were quite as distinct as the 
Venerable Bede portrayed them (see below). Yet once they were settled, all the 
peoples were keen to invent a unique pedigree for themselves. All have suffered, 
too, from the attentions of nationalist historians in our own day, who think 
nothing of projecting modern identities backwards into prehistory. In the absence 
of alternatives, it is difficult to know how one can describe the migrations except 
in terms of the traditional tribes. But some awareness of the drawbacks is 
necessary. 

Such, then, was the setting for the massive historical process which, from the 
standpoint of the Empire, has been called 'the Barbarian Invasions' and which, 
from the parochial standpoint of Western Europe, has often been reduced to 'the 
Germanic Invasions'. To the Germans it is known as the Volkerwanderung, the 
'Wandering of Peoples'-an apt term which could well be applied to its 
Germanic and non-Germanic participants alike. In reality, it engulfed the greater 
part of the European Peninsula, East and West, and continued throughout the 
first millennium ad and beyond, until all the wanderers had found a permanent 
abode. Its main events are only known from Roman sources, since the illiterate 
wanderers left few records of their own. Yet here is the process from which most 
of the later national groupings must trace their origins. To parody a phrase from 
a later age, it could well be called the Drang nach Westen, the Drive to the West, 
the road to permanent settlement. Without it, any concept of 'Europe' or of 
'Europeans' would be unrecognizable. Anthropological analysis suggests that 
three main types of population were involved: the settled inhabitants of the 
Empire, living in cities or on rural estates; the barbarian tribes, living from 
primitive arable or pastoral farming; and the true nomads. One must also add the 
sea raiders, who, like the nomads, lived largely from plunder, and who operated 



over huge distances in the northern seas. 


CSABA 

In the vast plains of Asia-he began-lived two brave, wild tribes. They 
were called Huns and Magyars. When their people grew numerous, the Huns 
set out for a new place to settle. After many hardships, they came to a land 
that was green with pastures, blue with swift-flowing rivers, rich with 
wooded mountains. But the land was not free. It belonged to the Romans, 
who called it Pannonia. 

The bravest of the Huns was a young prince, Attila, so they made him 
their king. He took more and more land, and ruled his people with an iron 
hand. When his wife died, leaving him with two sons, Csaba and Aladar, he 
boldly demanded the daughter of the Roman Emperor for his wife [and] half 
the Empire for the dowry. 

Finally, they clashed at Katalaun. The light cavalry of the Huns swept 
down on the Roman army like a furious whirlwind, only to be battered to 
pieces on their iron-clad ranks... Placid rivers turned into rivers of blood. 
The "Scourge of God" was broken.... Old in spirit, he died shortly 
afterwards. 

Then Csaba decided to take the strongest men and return to far Asia ... 
to the Magyars. He called his people together. "Dead or alive," he promised, 
"we will come to your aid if you are in danger." 

When he had left, yet another vast army of foes marched against the 
Huns. Endless columns of ruthless warriors swept into their stronghold. The 
Huns fell on their knees and prayed for Csaba. Thunder, long, deep, ever 
increasing thunder answered them ... A sparkling white streak appeared 
among the stars, forming a great arch like a rainbow. With the flashing 
swords and battlecries of thousands of men, and the clattering hoofbeats of 
thousands of horses, Csaba and his warriors swept down from the sky, 
scattering the terror-struck enemy. 

Csaba and his army of spirits came back one last time, leading the 
Magyars to rejoin their brothers in this beautiful land of ours. After that, he 




never came back. But the sparkling skyway, "the skyway of the warriors", 
has remained there forever.' 1 

Folk tales are the repository of collective memory. They were designed to 
entertain, but also to reinforce tribal identity. Five hundred years separated 
the exploits of Huns and Magyars in Hungary. Yet the latter continued to feel 
an affinity for their predecessors and fellow nomads. In modern times, none 
but a Magyar family would dream of calling their son Attila. 


From the technological standpoint, it is important to note that Iron Age 
agriculture was reaching the point where more was to be gained by tilling the 
same patch of ground than by constantly moving on. The barbarians were not 
simply seeking an adventure in the sun. They were looking for somewhere to put 
down roots. 

From the ethnic standpoint, the peoples of the Peninsula possessed the most 
variegated connections. Subject to certain reservations, however, one can say 
that the Indo-European element already predominated by the first half of the first 
millennium. The majority of inhabitants of the Empire, though not Latins or 
Hellenes by origin, were thoroughly latinized in the West and hellenized in the 
East. With some notable exceptions, the barbarian migrants belonged to one of 
the other main Indo-European families (see Appendix III, pp. 1232-3). 

Apart from the nomads, the non-Indo-Europeans would have included 
members of the Uralian-Finnic group; pockets of the original Iberian tribes of 
Spain; remnants of the pre-Latin population in the remoter parts of Italy; and 
unassim-ilated elements among the Illyrians, Dacians, and Thracians of the 
Balkans. The Jews had spread to all the major cities of the Mediterranean. The 
Uralian-Finnic group of peoples had already split into its component parts. The 
Finns, or Suomalainen had trekked across the subarctic taiga from their starting- 
point in Siberia. They occupied the lands between the end of the Baltic and the 
upper Volga, which would later become the heart of Russia. Ethnically, they 
were related both to the Huns and the Magyars and to several smaller units-the 
Cheremiss, Mordvins, Permians, Voguls, and Ostyaks-who stayed behind in the 
Ural region. More distantly, they were also related to the Altaic Group which 
includes Turks, Mongols, and Tartars. Their neighbours, the Lapps, were already 
engaged in their timeless peregrinations with the arctic reindeer. The Lapps 




called themselves 'Sameh'; but, in the interests of confusion, the Nordic nations 
usually called them 'Finns'. Hence the later Swedish province of Finnmark. 

In the Caucasus, two other fragmented groups of peoples had few known 
connections. The north Caucasians are made up from the Abkhaz, Chechens, and 
Avars; the south Caucasians from the Laz, Mingrelians, and Georgians. In the 
1920s an amateur linguist of Scottish origin, who assumed the russianized name 
of Nikolai Yakovelitch Marr (1864-1934), invented a theory which linked these 
Caucasian languages with Basque, Etruscan, and ancient Hebrew, thereby tying 
up all the loose ends of the European ethnic scene. Unfortunately, though 
patronized by the greatest of all Georgians, Marr's theory has been 
comprehensively disproved. 

The Asian nomads penetrated the Peninsula in waves that are spread over 
most of recorded history. The Huns, who appeared in the fifth century ad, were 
successors to earlier hordes who had ridden the same steppes, notably the 
ancient Scythians and the Irano-Sarmatians, whom Ptolemy reported as the 
overlords of the steppelands in the second century ad. They were the 
predecessors of the Avars, the Magyars, and the Mongols, who were all to reach 
central Europe. Other nomads restricted their movements to the vicinity of the 
Black Sea. One branch of the Turkic Bulgars had established a kingdom on the 
middle Volga. Another branch settled near the mouth of the Danube in the 
seventh century ad. The Khazars followed traces of the Bulgars, creating a 
kingdom stretching from the north Caucasus to the Dniester. The Patzinaks 
(Pechinegs) advanced into the Balkans in the wake of the Khazars. After them, 
another ephemeral state was built on the Black Sea steppes by the Cumans. The 
gypsies or 'Romanies' reached Europe from India in the eleventh century. One 
branch of the Turks impinged on the Caucasus about the same time; the main 
branch conquered the Balkans in the fourteenth century. 

Of all these non-Indo-Europeans, few were to leave a lasting mark. The 
Basques and the Maltese have weathered the centuries, speaking languages 
unrelated to any of their neighbours. The Jews, too, kept their separate identity. 
The Finns and Estonians on the Baltic, and Magyars in 'Hungaria', succeeded in 
founding modern nations. The Lapps still follow the reindeer. The Tartars, last 
descendants of the Mongols, have survived in 'Tatarstan' on the Volga and, 
despite modern deportations, in the Crimea. Gypsies are still spread all over 
Europe. The Turks, who won and lost a vast empire, have kept a precarious 
toehold in Europe in the immediate vicinity of Istanbul. The Balkan Bulgars 



have so identified with the Slav world that the communist regime could 
persecute its Turkish minority in the 1980s, on the grounds that their victims 
were not True Turks' but turkicized Slavs. If Bulgarian officialdom were 
consistent, it would have to recommend the mass expulsion of all Bulgarians on 
the grounds that they themselves are not True Slavs', but slavicized Turkics. 
[gagauz] 

'Indo-European', it must be emphasized, refers essentially to a linguistic 
category (see Chapter I, pp. 49-50), and only by extension to the peoples who 
have used those languages as their native tongue. All the languages which 
belong to the group can be traced back to a common proto-Indo-European 
language spoken somewhere in Eurasia over 5,000 years ago. Since then the 
group has spread over a wide area stretching from Iceland to Ceylon and, 
through modern colonization, to all continents of the world. It has been said that 
'language is the single most valuable possession of the human race'; and there 
can be no doubt that the 'Indo-Europeans' form one of the most important 
linguistic communities of human history.- (See Appendix III, p. 1232.) 

The real problem, however, is to determine what, apart from their linguistic 
heritage, the Indo-Europeans may have in common. The old idea that language is 
necessarily linked to race has been discredited. Languages can be easily 
transferred from one racial group to another. Over a period of time, there need be 
no correlation whatsoever between a people's 'native language' and their racial 
origins. (This can be easily demonstrated from the English-speaking world, 
where English has been adopted by millions of Afro-Americans and Afro- 
Caribbeans.) In the case of Eurasia, it is by no means clear whether the brown¬ 
skinned Indo-element exported their language to their paler 'European' 
neighbours, or vice versa, or whether both adopted it from a third party. There is 
a popular tradition in Afghanistan that all Indo-Europeans came from there. By 
the same token, even if it exists, the so-called 'European', 'Caucasian', or 
'Aryan' race group does not coincide with the Indo-European languages. The 
majority of Turks, for example, seem to be Caucasian by race but are manifestly 
non-European by language, [caucasia] 

Certainly, racial purity is a non-starter when applied to the European peoples 
in historic times. The population of the Roman Empire contained a strong 
admixture of both north African negroids and west Asian semitics. The barbarian 
tribes were constantly replenishing their genetic stock from captive women and 
prisoners. Though any visit to Ireland or to Scandinavia can easily demonstrate 


that racial types are no fiction of the imagination, language, culture, religion, and 
politics have been more powerful determinants of ethnicity than race. What is 
true is that any tribal or social grouping which lives together for any length of 
time needs to adopt a common language. Equally, to protect its sense of identity, 
it will often erect formal or informal barriers against interbreeding. In some 
cases, where membership is defined by criteria of kinship backed by religious 
taboos, miscegenation can be punished by expulsion. In this way, language and 
kinship do become intimately intertwined. 

The Celts, who were the avant-garde of the Indo-Europeans on the northern 
plain, had moved well to the west by Roman times. They had founded some of 
the most advanced archaeological cultures (see p. 84). They had been associated 
with the spread of metal-working, and their possession of iron weapons may 
well explain their dramatic expansion. Celts stormed Rome in 390 bc and 
Greece in 279 bc, terrifying their victims by their huge stature, their red hair and 
ferocious temperament, and by their sickening habit of head-hunting. For twenty 
years at the close of the second century bc, in the shape of the Cimbri, who set 
off from Jutland in the company of the Teutons, they caused immense havoc in 
Gaul and Spain until caught by the Consul Marius. Having annihilated the 
Teutons at Campi Putridi (see p. 87), Marius annihilated the Cimbri at Campi 
Raudii, near Verona, in 101 bc. One or two setbacks, however, did not stem the 
tide. The Celtic Boii were known in 'Bohemia'. Other Celts had settled in force 
in northern Italy, creating Cisalpine Gaul. They occupied the whole of the land to 
the west and northwest of the Alps, creating Transalpine Gaul. They crossed the 
Pyrenees, creating, among other things, Galicia: and they moved into the 
Rhineland. Already in the eighth century bc they had invaded the offshore 
islands, thereby creating the 'British' Isles. 

Hence, when the Roman legions conquered much of Western Europe in the 
late Republican era, it was the Celts who provided the native resistance. During 
the Empire, they constituted the basic demographic stock of romanized Celto- 
Iberians in Spain, of Gallo-Romans in Gaul, of Romano-Britons in Britain. 
Many of their tribal names are recognizable in modern places that have entirely 
lost their Celtic connections- Boii (Bohemia), Belgae (Belgium), Helvetii 
(Switzerland), Treveri (Trier), Parisi (Paris), Redones (Rennes), Dumnonii 
(Devon), Cantiaci (Kent), Brigantes (Brigsteer). In due course, overwhelmed in 
many parts by the next influx of Germanic peoples, they set up their permanent 
strongholds in the far north-west, on the 'Celtic fringe' of Britain-in Ireland, 
western Scotland, Wales, and Cornwall. In the fourth century ad, under pressure 



from the Anglo-Saxons, Celtic migrants from Cornwall crossed into 'Finisterre', 
thereby creating Brittany. Of the six Celtic languages which have survived into 
contemporary times, three belong to the Goidelic or Q-Celtic group, and three to 
the Brythonic or P-Celtic group. Cymru am byth! One branch of the Celts 
departed for Asia Minor. £ 0 foolish Galatians,' exclaimed St Paul when he 
visited these 'Gauls of the East' in ad 52 (Gal. 3:1). Three hundred years later St 
Jerome, who came from Trier, correctly noted that the Galatians spoke 
essentially the same tongue as the Gauls of his native Rhineland, [tristan] 

The Germanic peoples probably formed the largest barbarian population of 
the Roman period. First identified in southern Scandinavia, they were designated 
as Germani by Posidonius in 90 bc, by which time they were well into the task 
of settling the lands that have borne their name ever since. In the west they 
overlapped with the Celts, so that tribes such as the Cimbri and the Teutons have 
been variously designated as Celtic, Germanic, or germanized Celts. In the east 
they overlapped with the Slavs, so that controversies have raged over whether 
tribes such as the Venedi, who were mentioned by Tacitus, were Slavonic Wends, 
Germanic Vandals, or perhaps germanized Slavs. 

The Germanic peoples are generally classified in three groupings. The 
Scandinavian group gave rise to the later Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, and 
Icelandic communities. The West Germanic group, centred on the North Sea 
coast, included Batavians, Frisians, Franks, Alamans, Jutes, Angles, and Saxons. 
They are the principal ancestors of the later Dutch, Flemish, English, and 
lowland Scots communities; also, in part, of the French. The East Germanic 
group, to the east of the Elbe, included Swabians, Fombards, Burgundians, 
Vandals, Gepids, Alans, and Goths. They were largely responsible for the tribal 
traffic jam on the northern plain, and were among the principal actors in the 
crisis of the Western Empire, [futhark] 

The Germania of Tacitus provides a detailed survey of the customs, social 
structure, and religion of the Germanic tribes. They had traded with the 
Mediterranean world since Bronze Age times, and were adopting Roman 
farming methods, even viticulture. Their clans were united by kinship, and ruled 
in conjunction with a democratic assembly of warriors, the [ding] or 'Thing'. 
Their religion centred on the fertility gods Njordr (Nerthus) and Freyr, on Wodin 
(Odin), the master of magic and god of war, and on Thor (Donar), protector of 
the farmers against giants, fairies, and evil of all sorts. There was no priesthood, 
since their war-leaders, who often took the title of king, combined both military 



and religious functions. They long resisted Christianity, though the Goths 
adopted Arianism at an early date (see below). 


TRISTAN 

By the roadside at Menabilly, two miles north of Fowey in Cornwall, stands 
a tapering stone column some seven feet high. It bears a faint inscription, in 
sixth-century Roman letters: 'dmstans hie iacet cunomori fiuus' (Here lies Tristan [or 
Tristram], son of Quonimorius). The earthworks of an Iron Age fort, Castle 
Dor, rise in the vicinity. Excavations within its perimeter have uncovered 
evidence of its reoccupation in early medieval times. The neighbouring farm 
of Lantyan also suggests that here stood ancient Lancien -the palace of 
'King Mark, called Quonimorius'. The Forest of Moresk or Morrois, the Evil 
Ford of Malpas, and the manor of Tir Gwyn or La Blanche Lande, and the 
monastery of St Sampson-in-Golant, all with names which recur in the later 
texts, are to be found nearby. There is little reason to doubt that the 
tombstone belongs to the historic Tristan. 1 

According to legend, Tristan, prince of the lost land of Lyonesse, fell 
passionately in love with Isolt, princess of Ireland, whom he had conveyed 
by sea to her marriage with his kinsman, King Mark. Fired by a secret love 
potion, their passion condemns them to a lifetime of illicit trysts and 
elopements. It ends when Tristan is mortally wounded by the King's 
poisoned spear, and Isolt casts herself in death into their last embrace. 

Centuries later, the tragic Celtic love story was versified in courtly 
romance throughout Europe. The earliest French fragment, like that in 
Rhenish German by Eilhardt, dates from 1170. The fullest German version, 
by Gottfried von Strassburg (c.1200), provided the main source for the 
libretto of Wagner's opera (1859). There were early Provencal and early 
English versions. In the fifteenth century Sir Thomas Malory's Morte 
D'Arthur, like the French prose Roman de Tristan, combines the Tristan 
story with that of King Arthur. A copy of the French version, with 
magnificent illuminated miniatures, is preserved as Vienna MS Codex 2537 
in the Austrian National Library. 2 A Byelorussian Tristan composed in the 




sixteenth century, and now preserved in Poznan, constitutes the earliest item 
of secular Belarus literature. 3 By then, the story was already 1,000 years old: 

And then, anon, Sir Tristan took the sea, and La Beale Isoud... in their 
cabin, it happed that they were thirsty, and they saw a little flacket of gold, 
and it seemed it was noble wine ... Then they laughed and made good cheer, 
and either drank to other freely ... But by that the drink was in their bodies, 
they loved either other so well that never their love departed for weal neither 
for woe... . 4 

Like Tristan, the central figure of the Arthurian cycles remains a 
historical enigma. Most scholars agree that Arthur, The once and future 
king', must have been a Christian British warlord battling the tide of Anglo- 
Saxon invaders. But no one has identified him with certainty. The eighth- 
century chronicler, Nennius, called Arthur the dux bellorum, who had 
crushed the Saxons at 'Mount Badon'. Welsh sources called him 
amheradawr or 'emperor'. In the twelfth century, Geoffrey of Monmouth 
said that he was born on the stupendous island fortress of Tintagel on the 
coast of Cornwall, and that he died at Glastonbury, by the shrine of the Holy 
Grail. Modern archaeology, which has discovered a late Roman monastic 
community at Tintagel, has strengthened the Cornish claims. But another 
study connects him with a Welsh leader, Owain Ddantgwain, King of 
Gwynedd and Powys, son of the Head Dragon, also known as 'the Bear', 
who died in 520. 5 Somerset tradition holds that the hillfort at Cadbury Castle 
sheltered Arthur's court at Camelot, whilst Glastonbury was the 'Avalon' 
where he died. In 1278 King Edward I ordered a tomb at Glastonbury to be 
opened, and found the caskets of a warrior and a lady. He took them to 
contain the remains of Arthur and Guinevere. A cross on the tomb, since 
lost, was said to bear the inscription hic iacet sepultus inclitus rex 
arturius in insula avaloniae (Here lies buried the famous King Arthur in 
the Isle of Avalon). 6 

Ancient legends constantly renew their purposes. Just as medieval England's 
Anglo-Norman Kings liked to link themselves with the pre-Saxon rulers of 
the conquered land, so Romantic Victorians sought to reinforce their sense of 
modern British unity by pondering the fate of the Ancient Britons. Alfred, 
Lord Tennyson (1809-92) spent forty-two years as Poet Laureate and fifty- 
five working on his much-admired, and much-derided, Arthurian epic, The 



Idylls of the King. It was an extended allegory of the eternal struggle 
between spirituality and materialism: 

... their fears 

Are morning shadows huger than the shapes 
That cast them, not those gloomier which forego 
The darkness of that battle in the west 
Where all of high and holy dies away. 7 


The Germanic peoples were on the move throughout the imperial period. The 
Gothic federation left its resting-place on the lower Vistula in the second century 
ad, drifting slowly south-eastwards against the main migratory current. Two 
hundred years later, the Visigoths were established on the Black Sea coast north 
of the Danube delta. The Ostrogoths lay further east, in the Crimea and on the 
Dnieper steppes, precariously close to the advancing Huns. In that fourth 
century, some of the Frankish tribes may have been invited into the Empire as 
imperial foederati, and charged with the defence of the Rhine. 

The Slavonic peoples pressed hard on the heels of their Germanic 
neighbours. Their prehistory is less well documented, since they had fewer 
contacts with the Empire, and has become the subject of many modern musings. 
The ancient 'Slavonic homeland' has often been viewed as a fixed reservation. 
The Polish 'aboriginal school' of prehistorians insists that it extended over the 
territory between the Oder and the Vistula ab origine, although it is more 
convincingly designated to a wooded zone further east, on the slopes of the 
Carpathians. For some inexplicable reason Western scholars love to relegate the 
proto-Slavs to the least likely and least comfortable of locations, in the middle of 
the Pripet Marshes. Whatever its bounds, the Slavonic homeland straddled the 
main prehistoric trail. It must have been overrun, and probably subordinated, by 
each of the great nomadic incursions. A Scythian chieftain was buried with all 
his treasures at Witaszkowo on the western Neisse. The memory of the 
Sarmatians lingered for 2,000 years, so that Polish nobles would claim 
Sarmatian pedigree, [crux] The migrating Goths and Gepids drifted slowly past, 
to no known ill effect. In the fifth century ad the passage of the Huns left few 
traces except for a tantalizing phrase in an Anglo-Saxon poem, the Widsith, 
which tells how 'the Hraede with their sharp swords must defend their ancient 
seat from the people of Aetla by the Wistla wood'.- The Huns' successors, the 





Avars, created some sort of Slavo-Avaric confederation that first enters the 
historical record from Byzantine sources in the sixth century. 

It is doubtful whether the proto-Slavonic language could have been deeply 
differentiated until the main migrations began in the middle of the first 
millennium. It is only known from scholarly reconstructions. Like Greek and 
Latin, it was marked by highly complex declensions and conjugations and by 
free word order. The Slavonic tribes are often thought to have developed a 
characteristic social institution, the [zadruga] or 'joint family', where all the 
relatives of the chieftain lived together under fierce patriarchal discipline. They 
worshipped numerous deities such as Triglav, the Three-Headed One, Svarog, 
the Sun-Maker, and Perun, the God of the Thunderclap. Interestingly enough, 
much of their religious vocabulary, from Bog (God) to raj (Paradise), is 
Sarmato-Iranian in origin; just as many of their words relating to primitive 
technology, such as dach (roof in Polish) or plug (plough in Russian) is 
Germanic. Isolated though they were, they had clearly benefited from contact 
with their neighbours. (See Appendix III, p. 1223.) 

A taste of the shaky sources, and of the scepticism, of Western historians 
may be drawn from the following description of the Slavs, which was compiled, 
with some poetic licence, 'from the evidence of Procopius and of the Emperor 
Mauritius': 


The Sclavonians used one common language (it was harsh and irregular) and were known by the 
resemblance of their form which deviated from the swarthy Tartar and approached, without attaining, the 
lofty stature and fair complexion of the German. Four thousand six hundred villages were scattered over the 
provinces of Russia and Poland, and their huts were hastily built of rough timber... We may, not perhaps 
without flattery, compare them to the architecture of the beaver... 


FUTHARK 

Runes or 'matchstick signs' form the basis of an alphabet which was used 
by the Vikings and which, from its first six letters, was known as 'Futhark'. 
Runes were chiselled into wood or stone, often in long, snakelike 
inscriptions. There were two main variants-Common or Danish Futhark, 
and Swedo-Norwegian, each with sixteen basic signs: 






Runic inscriptions have been found in great numbers, especially in 
central Sweden and in Denmark. They record voyages, legal agreements, 
and deaths, sometimes in skaldic verse. A silver neck-ring from Troons in 
northern Norway tells how the silver was won: 

Forum drengia Frislands a vit We went to the lands of Frisia 

ok vigs fQtum ver skiptum And we it was who split the spoils of war. 


At Gripsholm in Sodermanland, a mother mourns her sons, Ingmar and 
Harald, who perished on an expedition to the Mediterranean: 

peir foru drengila fiarri et gulli Like men they journeyed for gold, 
ok austarla ame gafu And in the east they feasted the eagle, 

dou sunnarla a Serklandi And in the south they died in Serkland. 


There is a runic graffito in a gallery of St Sophia's in Istanbul, and another 
on one of the lions of St Mark, brought to Venice from Athens. 1 

Runes, however, were not just used for writing. The 16-sign Futhark of 
the Vikings, which dates from ad c. 350 , had been condensed from the much 
more extensive Hallristningar or 'Rune Hoard', which was used from the 
Bronze Age onwards for the purposes of occult divination: 

** (r)z& tr:: 

t r it o 114 a ? * nrnn 4 r- ' 
t B s' (r) N* 9*9 

x w ♦ i a s •a $ 


The Germania of Tacitus describes the reading of the runes: 

They break off a branch from a fruit tree, and slice it into strips; they 
distinguish these by certain runes and throw them, as fortune will have it, 



onto a white cloth. Then the state priest... or the family father... after 
praying to the gods ... picks up three of them, one at a time, and reads their 
meaning from the runes carved on them. 3 

In later times, among many variants, the 33-sign series found in Anglo- 
Saxon England and the 18-sign series of Armanen Runes found in the 
German-speaking world had much in common (see Appendix III, pp. 1234- 
5). Runes provide a gateway to the mysterious and strangely beautiful 
aesthetic world of the vikings. 

Ogham, or Ogams, were a Celtic counterpart of Scandinavian runes, 
being used both for writing and for divination, especially in Ireland. Each 
sign consisted of simple vertical staves cut against a horizontal or slanting 
baseline. Each was primarily associated with a tree and with a letter 
corresponding to the tree's name, but also, by alliteration, with birds and 
animals, with colours, with periods of the year, and with days of the week: 

i ii hi mi iuii 1 u 1111111 1 ii "f mi iii"XOb^ 

BIF SNHDTCQMGNjSTR AOUElE*OilRUAo 


Europe's native writing systems were an essential adjunct to pagan 
religion. Ogam and Runes, like the North Italic and the Etruscan, were 
rooted in times when the divination of Nature lay at the heart of all 
knowledge and understanding. Even so much of the associated lore and 
magic has survived the advent of classical and Christian civilization. 


The fertility of the soil, rather than the labour of the natives, supplied the rustic plenty of the 
Sclavonians ... The field which they sowed with millet and panic afforded, in the place of bread, a coarse 
and less nutritive food ... As their supreme God, they adored an invisible master of the thunder... 

The Sclavonians disdained to obey a despot... Some voluntary respect was yielded to age and valour; 
but each tribe or village existed as a separate republic, and all must be persuaded where none could be 
compelled ... They fought on foot, almost naked ... They swam, they dived, they remained under water, 
drawing breath through a hollow cane. But these were the achievements of spies or stragglers. The military 
art was unknown to the Sclavonians. Their name was unknown, and their conquests obscure.- 


The Baltic peoples lived in still greater isolation. The Prussians to the east of 
the Vistula delta, the Lithuanians in the valley of the Niemen, and the Letts on 






the western Dvina spoke languages that scholars regard as the least evolved of 
all. They were once thought, erroneously, to form part of the Slavonic group, but 
are now judged closer to proto-Indo-European even than Sanskrit. Like all Indo- 
Europeans, the Baits must surely have migrated from the East at some point in 
prehistory, but nothing is known of their movements. They settled on the 
morainic debris of the last Ice Age, and stayed there among the dark pines and 
the shimmering lakes. Like the Finns and the Estonians, they seem to have been 
left alone until the tide of the peoples turned in the opposite direction in the first 
half of the second millennium, [lietuva] 


LIETUVA 

There is no shortage of authorities to confirm that the Lithuanian language 

is The most archaic of all Indo-European tongues,' 1 or that 'it has better 
preserved its archaic forms ... than have other contemporary Indo-European 
languages'. 2 Ever since Karl Brugmann published his Grundriss, or outline, 
of comparative Indo-Germanic languages in 1897, Lithuanian has been a 
favourite among etymologists of the Romantic persuasion. 

It is true that the Lithuanian lexicon contains a core of words that any 
classicist would recognize: vyras 'man', saule 'sun', memo 'moon', ugnis 
'fire', kalba 'language'. Lithuania has kept dual as well as plural number, 
long vowels of nasal origin, seven-case declensions, and a verb system of 
tenses, conjugations, and moods not dissimilar to Latin's. On the other hand, 
the Slavonic element in the Lithuanian lexicon is also very large: galva 
'head' (Russian golova), ranka 'hand' (Polish rqka), paukStis 'bird', ziema 
'winter', and sniegas 'snow' (Polish ptaszek, zima, and snieg). Polish, too, 
has plural number, nasal vowels, and seven cases. Unlike Lithuanian (or 
French), most Slavonic languages have not lost the neuter form. In reality, 
Lithuanian is mainly characterized by features common to both the Baltic 
and the Slavonic language groups. Anyone who imagines that it is a close 
relative to Sanskrit is in for a disappointment. 

None the less, the survival of Lithuanian is remarkable. It remained a 
local peasant vernacular throughout the long centuries of the Grand Duchy 




of Lithuania (see p. 392), and was never used as a language of high culture 
or government. The Lithuanian Statutes, written in ruski or 'Ruthenian' were 
translated into Latin (1530) and Polish (1531), but not into Lithuanian. 
Starting with the Catechism (1547) of M. Mazvidas, however, Lithuanian 
was used for religious purposes. In the nineteenth century, Russian educators 
tried printing it in Cyrillic. But the Polish bishops of Wilno (Vilnius) 
successfully countered the ploy by supporting Lithuanian primary education 
in the Roman alphabet, thereby cementing Lithuania's deep attachment to 
Catholicism. This makes it entirely appropriate for amateur linguists to cut 
their teeth on a scriptural text: 

Ir angelas 
tare jiems: 

'Nesibijokties! 

Stay!' 

Apsakau jums didj dzaugsma 
kurs nusidus 

vissiems zmonems. (Luke 2:10) 3 


Despite Western conventions, it is important to view the barbarian migrations as 
a whole. They were not confined to the Germanic peoples, nor to the Roman 
frontline in the West. What appeared in the West as a sudden deluge at the end of 
the fourth century was just one act in a drama that was far more extensive both 
geographically and chronologically. 

The first sign of the coming deluge occurred in 376, when the Ostrogoths, 
pressed by the Huns, petitioned the Emperor Valens to settle in Moesia. Some of 
them were allowed to cross the Danube, but were required to surrender both their 
arms and their children. Two years later, in August 378, they fought a pitched 
battle at Hadrianopolis (Edirne) in which the Emperor was killed. Thanks to the 
heavy cavalry of the Goths' allies, the Sarmatian Alans, Rome's invincible 
legions were decisively beaten. (In military history, that demonstration of the 
power of Sarmatian-style lances and their oversize chargers marks the debut of 
the most characteristic features of medieval warfare.) Four years after that it was 
the turn of the Visigoths. Their king and war-leader, Alaric, cannot have been 
indifferent to the Ostrogoths' success. He was given the title of magister militum 
illyricorum as a sop. But in the course of a thirty-year adventure his imperial 




office did not restrain him from sacking first Athens (396) and then Rome (410). 
The immediate cause of Alaric's wrath lay in the Empire's refusal to accept the 
Visigoths for settlement in Noricum. Thereafter, he conceived a plan to take 
them to Africa. But his death at Cosenza caused yet another change of direction. 
Alaric's successor, Athaulf, married the captured stepsister of the Emperor 
Honorius, whilst his brother Wallia gave the Visigoths respite by settling them in 
Aquitaine. The Visigoth kingdom of Tolosa (Toulouse) was short-lived. But it 
provided the springboard from which, some time after 507, the Visigoths set out 
to create their most enduring legacy in Spain. 

The rampage of the Visigoths provided an opening for three more huge 
invasions. When the legions of Gaul were withdrawn to protect Constantinople 
from Alaric, the garrison of the Rhine was dangerously thinned. Some time 
around 400 the Burgundians took their chance to move into the area at the 
confluence of Rhine and Main. Thirty years later they were challenged by the 
Roman general Aetius, whose Hunnish auxiliaries drove them off. But in 443 
they were back to settle permanently in the vicinity of Lyons. Henceforth the 
Burgundian Kingdom developed in the valleys of the Rhone and Saone, 
controlling the principal Alpine passes, [nibelung] 

At Christmas 406 a vast horde of barbarians crossed the frozen Rhine near 
Coblenz. Vandals, Suevi, and Alans poured into Gaul. The Vandals took a 
roundabout route to Alaric's original destination in Africa. They crossed the 
Pyrenees in 409, the Straits of Gibraltar in 429, and the gates of Carthage in 439. 
They took 33 years to cover the 2,500 miles from the Rhine. From their 
Carthaginian base they took to the sea, seizing the Balearic Islands and Sardinia. 
In 455, under Genseric, they imitated Alaric and sacked Rome. The Vandal 
kingdom in Africa remained a major force until the restoration of imperial power 
in the following century. The Vandals parted company with their original 
companions, the Suevi and the Alans, in Spain. The Suevi created a kingdom in 
the far north-west, in Galicia; the western Alans went for the valley of the Tagus. 


NIBELUNG 


For several decades at the turn of the fifth century, the Burgundian court 
stood at Worms on the Rhine, the ancient Civitas Vangionum. Known as 




Nibelungs after a former chief, the Burgundians had been brought in as 
auxiliaries on the imperial frontier. They were to be driven out in 435-6 
during battles with the Roman general Aetius and the advancing Huns. The 
names of three royal brothers Gundharius (Gunther), Gislaharius (Giselher), 
and Godomar (Gemot) are known from the later Lex Burgundiorum. After 
halting at Geneva, they moved on to Lyons, where in 461 they set up the first 
Kingdom of Burgundy, [lugounum] A plaque on the site of the former 
palace at Worms recalls that city's distinctions: 

Here Was 

The Holy Temple Area of the Romans 
The Royal Castle of the Nibelungen 
The Imperial Residence of Charlemagne 
The Court of the Prince-Bishop of Worms 
Destroyed by the French in the Years 1689 and 1745. 

More than One Hundred Imperial and Princely Diets 
Took Place Here. 

Here, Before Emperor and Empire, Stood 
Martin Luther 1 

Further north, near the present frontier of the Netherlands, stands the 
cathedral of St Victor at Xanten (Ad Sanctos). St Victor, a Christian martyr 
of the late Roman era, is taken to be the prototype of the legendary warrior 
Siegfried (Victory-Peace). 

At the time of the Burgundians' sojourn at Worms, the Huns of Attila 
were still camped on the plains of the Middle Danube. They too form one of 
the many historical elements which, interwoven with the fantasies of myth 
and saga, form the basis for the most famous Germanic legends. 

The Nibelungenlied is an epic poem of some 2,300 rhyming stanzas 
written in Austria in the early thirteenth century. Of 34 extant manuscripts, 
MS A is kept at Munich, MS B at St Gall, and MS C at Donaueschingen. All 
variants relate the adventures of the Burgundian court following the arrival 
of the invincible Prince Siegfried-dragon-slayer, guardian of the 
Nibelungs' treasure, and owner of the magic cape of darkness. Siegfried 
saves the country from a Saxon army, overpowers the Icelandic princess 
Brunhild, who will only submit to a man that can defeat her in athletic 
contest, and, after ceding Brunhild to King Gunther, wins the hand of 



Gunther's sister, Krimhild. The harmony of the two couples cools when 
Brunhild learns the secret of her defeat. Gunther's retainer Hagen discovers 
Siegfried's one point of weakness, kills him with a spear as he is drinking at 
a spring, and casts his treasure into the Rhine. 2 (See Plate 9.) 

Just as the unknown author of the Nibelungenlied transposed these pagan 
tales into the courtly and Christian idiom of medieval Germany, so Richard 
Wagner would transpose them, embellished, into the idiom of Romantic 
opera in Das Rheingold (1869), Die Walkiire (1870), Siegfried (1872), and 
Gotterdammerung (1876). The first complete performance of the Ring Cycle 
took place at the Festspielhaus, Bayreuth, in August 1876. 

In the second part of the Nibelungenlied, the widowed Krimhild leaves 
Germany to marry the heathen Etzel (Attila). In due course, she invites her 
Burgundian relatives to visit her at Etzelburg/Gran (the modern Esztergom). 
Her aim is to avenge her beloved Siegfried. After cutting off Hagen's head 
with Siegfried's faithful sword, she leads all the poem's principal 
personalities into a bloodbath of common hatred. 

Modern literary pilgrims can trace the road of the Burgundian party from 
Worms to 'Hunland'. They go from the 'See of the Three Rivers' at Passau, 
where Krimhild's brother was bishop, to the seat of Count Rudiger at 
Bechlaren (Pochlam), and on to the fortress of Melk, to the Roman gate of 
Traismauer, to Tulin, where Etzel awaited his bride, and to Vienna, where 
the seventeen-day wedding banquet was held. Yet at the end all is sorrow: 

Hier hat die Mar ein Ende. 

Diz ist der Nibelunge Not. 

(Here the tale has its end. This is the Nibelung's downfall) 


In Britain, the departure of the legions in 410 gave a signal for the onslaught 
of the sea raiders. For more than a century, the Roman governors had sought to 
hold the forts of the 'Saxon Shore'. Now the Romano-Britons were left to their 
own devices. Some Roman troops may possibly have returned for a decade or 
two after 418; but a vain appeal for assistance was made to Aetius in 446. Soon 
afterwards, all regular contact between Britain and the Empire was severed. 
Henceforth, the Anglo-Saxon longships brought not just raiders but mercenaries 
and colonists. In 457 Kent was surrendered to Hengest's Jutes, a tribe that had 




worked its way from 'Jutland' in Denmark via Frisia. The Angles, who left a 
sign of their earlier abode in the district of 'Angeln' in Schleswig, took over 
Britain's eastern coastlands. They sailed into the Humber, founding communities 
which underlay the expansive kingdom of Mercia, meaning the March or 
'Frontier'. The Saxons, under Aelle, first landed on the south coast, laying the 
foundation of the kingdom of the south Saxons (Sussex). Others-the middle 
Saxons (Middlesex) and the east Saxons (Essex)-moved up the valley of the 
Thames. 

Thus began the long conquest and settlement of eastern Britain which 
resulted in the emergence of 'England'. For three centuries and more, hundreds 
of local chieftains controlled their own minuscule statelets, until by a process of 
merger and annexation the larger groupings emerged. The most powerful of the 
later Anglo-Saxon principalities, that of the West Saxons (Wessex), did not 
eliminate its rivals until 940-five hundred years after the first Anglo-Saxon 
raids. In the meantime the hard-pressed Britons struggled to stem the tide. Their 
victory under the semi-legendary King Arthur at Mons Badonicus c.500 served 
to hold the Anglo-Saxons back, and to preserve the Celts of the West, [tristan] 

Whilst the Germanic tribes overran the Empire's western provinces, the 
instigators of the cataclysm, the Huns, finally made their appearance in 
Pannonia. They built their tented capital on the plains of the Tisza (Theiss) in 
420. In 443 they came under the rule of Attila (c.404-53). His was a name that 
became a byword for wanton destruction: 'The grass never grew where his horse 
had trod.' For several seasons this 'Scourge of God' wreaked havoc in the 
Empire's Danubian provinces. In 451 he rode to the north and west, collecting 
assorted barbarian allies, including Gepids and Burgundians. He spared Paris, 
protected by the prayers of St Genevieve. But on the Catalaunian Plains near 
Chalons, on grassland well suited to his cavalry, he met bloody defeat at the 
hands of a coalition formed by Aetius from Theodoric's Visigoths and the Salian 
Franks under the 'Sea-born' Merovech. 'His retreat beyond the Rhine comprised 
the last victory achieved in the name of the western Empire.'- Attila then turned 
on Italy. Turin, Padua, and Aquileia suffered the earlier fate of Metz. 'The 
succeeding generation could scarce discover the ruins of Aquileia.' At Milan, 
Attila was offended by a mural in the royal palace which showed the princes of 
Scythia prostrate before the imperial throne. He commanded a painter to reverse 
the roles. In 452, on the shores of Lake Bolsena, he was somehow persuaded to 
withdraw by the Patriarch of Rome, Leo I. Suitably enough, having retired to the 
Tisza with an item of female loot called Ildico, he expired during the nuptial 


night from a burst artery, 'suffocated by a torrent of blood ... which regurgitated 
into his stomach and lungs'. The horsemen of the Hunnic horde dispersed as 
quickly as they had appeared. Shattered by the treacherous attack of their former 
allies, they were forced to cede their hold on the Pannonian station to the Gepids 
and the Ostrogoths, [csaba] [epidemia] 

Attila's death gave the Ostrogoths the chance to assert their independence to 
the full. Advancing from Pannonia, they launched into a campaign of rapine in 
the Eastern Empire which did not cease until Theodoric received the usual prize, 
together with the titles of magister militum and patricius of Italy. Unfortunately 
for him, another barbarian warlord was in the field. Having casually deposed the 
last of the Western emperors, Odoacer had won his position at the head of a 
mercenary army operating in Sicily, Dalmatia, and even beyond the Alps. A fight 
to the finish was inevitable. The end came after a three-year siege of Ravenna 
and Odoacer's murder by Theodoric. It was 493. The way was now open for the 
establishment of an Ostrogothic kingdom in Italy. 

Similarly, Merovech's grandson, Hlodwig or Clovis (c.466-511), king of the 
Salian Franks, was able to exploit his status as a Roman foederatus and to 
multiply his dominions in the disputed province of Gaul. Starting from the old 
Salian at Tournai, Clovis defeated the last 'Roman' general of Gaul, Syagrius, 
before conquering the rival Riparian Franks (in modern 'Franconia'), the 
Alamanni, the Burgundians, and in 507 the Visigoths of Aquitaine. Putting all 
the lesser Frankish princes to death, and taking a Christian wife, Clotilda, he was 
baptized at Rheims, possibly at Easter 496. The result was a huge 'Merovingian' 
realm stretching from the Pyrenees to Bavaria. Clovis reputedly received a 
diadem from the Emperor in Constantinople, together with the honorific title of 
Consul. He died in his new capital, Paris, after a reign of thirty years. Without 
knowing it, he had founded what Eavisse called 'not a nation, but a historical 
force'-a force which was destined to give rise both to France and to the 
German Empire. 


EPIDEMIA 


By all accounts, many of Attila's warriors were already stricken by a 
violent illness on the eve of their defeat by Aetius in 451. Some historians 




have concluded that it was the Huns who added smallpox to Europe's pool 
of diseases. 1 Others report that smallpox was already raging during the 
Roman plague of 165-80. It was certainly still killing large numbers in the 
eighteenth century. It claimed 14,000 in Paris in the epidemic of 1719, which 
preceded the discovery of vaccination by a couple of years. Even so, it killed 
Louis XV in 1774, and possibly Joseph II in 1790. 

From time immemorial, all feared the shadow of pestilence. Russian 
folklore included the tale of the ghostly Pest Maiden, whom villagers kissed 
at their peril. In the Book of Revelation, there was the Fourth Horseman on 
his 'pale horse', 'and his name that sat on him was Death'. 

For the long-term historian, as for the epidemiologist, the crucial 
problem is to know why certain diseases, which exist in mild form for 
generations, can suddenly explode with devastating virulence. 
Environmental shifts, a mutant strain, or a fresh human habitat may all be 
contributing factors. Smallpox, for instance, was well known to medieval 
Europe without ever being the worst scourge of its kind. Yet on reaching the 
Americas it wreaked unparalleled havoc, virtually annihilating Aztec 
civilization, decimating the native Americans, turning 20 per cent of 
mankind into 3 per cent, 'singlehandedly establishing and sustaining 
slavery'. 2 Syphilis, 'the Americans' Revenge', followed a similar career in 
reverse. In the Americas it had caused minor skin irritations; in Europe it 
killed and disfigured millions, [syphilus] 

Malaria was exceptional. Endemic since ancient times, when it had 
claimed Alexander the Great, it was never responsible for sensational 
epidemics. But it killed steadily and ceaselessly, especially in districts like 
the Campagna marshes near Rome, where the plasmodium parasite could 
breed in warm, stagnant water. Cumulatively, it 'caused the greatest harm to 
the greatest number'. 3 

Every deadly disease has had its day, and every age its particular plague. 
Leprosy reached its peak in the thirteenth century. The Black Death cut its 
swathe in the fourteenth century (See Chapter VI) and several times later. 
Syphilis raged during the Renaissance and Reformation, and on into the 
Enlightenment. Tuberculosis reaped its crop among the Romantics, claiming 
Chopin, Siowacki, Keats, and countless others. Cholera was the scourge of 
Europe's early industrial cities, and influenza the unlikely reaper of the early 
twentieth century. AIDS, the leprosy of the late twentieth century, arrived to 



shake the complacency of a scientific age, and to show that plagues were not 
just a curiosity of the past, [leper] [sanitas] 


In that sixth century, the barbarian conquests were consolidated despite the 
brief reassertion of the Empire under Justinian (see below). The Visigothic 
kingdom flourished in Spain, unlike its predecessor in southern Gaul. Under 
Leovigild, who made his capital at Toledo, it absorbed the Suevian realm. The 
Ostrogothic kingdom, which included several of the Danubian provinces as well 
as Italy, was taken over by the last of the east Germanic tribes to migrate, the 
Lombards. The Lombards, or Langobardi, 'Long Beards', had spent the century 
since the dispersal of Huns mastering the Gepids and the Avars beyond the 
Danube. But in 568 they turned south, and established a new hegemony centred 
on Pavia. Henceforth, the Italian peninsula was to be contested between the 
Lombards, the Byzantines in the south, and the ever-growing power of the 
Pranks. The Pranks, in fact, were expanding in all possible directions. They 
displaced a party of Saxons which had established itself on the northern coast of 
Gaul. On their eastern marches they were pressing on the main body of Saxons, 
and on the Thuringians. It was the Pranks who contained the Avars in the 
Bavarian Gap, and then sent Germanic colonists to their Ostland or 'Austria' on 
the middle Danube. It was the resultant collapse of the Avars in the Danube 
basin which paved the way for the advances of the Slavs. 

The western Slavs marched across the plain, up the Elbe, and up the Danube. 
The Wends or Sorbs of Lusatia, to the west of the Oder, and the Kashubs of 
Pomerania are still extant. Czech tribes took over Bohemia, the Slovaks the 
southern slopes of the Carpathians. These were the founders of the Great 
Moravian Empire which flourished in the eighth and ninth centuries. The Poles, 
or Polanie, the 'people of the open plains' first appeared on the Warta, an eastern 
tributary of the Oder. Related tribes occupied virtually the whole of the Vistula 
basin. 

Plynie Wisla, plynie 
Po polskiej krainie, 

Po polskiej krainie, 

I dopoki plynie 
Polska nie zaginie, 

Polska nie zaginie. 




(Flows the Vistula, flows | Across the Polish land, | Across the Polish land, | So 
long as she keeps flowing, | Poland still shall stand, | Poland still shall stand.) 

The eastern Slavs gradually moved north and east from the Dnieper into 
Baltic and Finnic territory, and into the forests of the upper Volga. Their 
centrifugal movements created divergences that underlay the later division 
between Ruthenians and Russians. If the Poles sang of the Vistula, the Russians 
were to sing of the Volga, which was to become their 'native mother'. 

The southern Slavs invaded the Empire in the sixth century, crossing the 
Danube in many places. In 540 they laid siege to Constantinople. They were to 
slavicize Illyria, Bulgaria, Macedonia [makedon], and most of mainland 
Greece. The Croats, a people first mentioned in what is now southern Poland, 
colonized the upper Sava and the Dalmatian coast. Another group which settled 
on the upper Drava became known as Slovenes. The Serbs took over the region 
at the confluence of the Drava, the Sava, and the Danube. 

The dynamism of the migrant tribes had serious implications for all their 
neighbours. Where the preceding population was not overwhelmed or absorbed, 
it was frequently shunted into motion. In the West, the Celts were swamped in 
Gaul and corralled in Britain. Only the Irish were secure from invasion. A Celtic 
people from Ireland, the Scots, migrated to the highlands of Caledonia and, by 
subjugating the native Piets, laid the foundations of Gaelic Scotland. In the same 
period, a migration of Celts from Cornwall laid the foundations of Celtic 
Brittany. Elsewhere, the Celtic Britons were pushed back by the Anglo-Saxons 
into the fastnesses of Wales. 

In the East, in one of the darkest periods of the Dark Ages, the confusion in 
the Danube basin was not resolved for almost three centuries. The Slavs still 
evaded literary sources, and their struggles with the Avars and with the 
Germanic outposts are not well documented. The last piece of the jigsaw did not 
fall into place until the irruption of the nomadic Magyars in the ninth century 
(see p. 296). On the Pontine steppes, a jumble of peoples passed under the 
hegemony of yet another tribe of Asian adventurers-the Khazars. They in their 
turn submitted in the early seventh century to the overlordship of a Turkic 
dynasty from the North Caucasus. Though Indo-European Slavs were present 
within the jumble, they would not begin to form the dominant element until the 
founding of the Kievan state in the ninth century, [khazaria] 



The effect of the migrations on the ethnic and linguistic make-up of the 
Peninsula was profound. They radically changed the ethnic mix of the 
population in several countries, and in some parts introduced completely fresh 
ingredients. If in ad 400 the population of the Peninsula had been clearly divided 
between 'Romans' and 'barbarians', by 600 or 700 it was inhabited by a far more 
complex mix of semi-barbarized ex-Romans and semi-romanized ex-barbarians. 


KHAZARIA 

Of all the transient realms of the European plain, none has aroused more 
controversy than that of the Khazars. Yet from ad c.630, when it was taken 
over by the Turkic dynasty of Ashihna, to 970, when it was conquered by 
Prince Svyatoslav of Kiev, it played a vital role in the contacts between East 
and West. 

The administrative organization of Khazaria reflected the variety of its 
subject peoples. The Khazar kagan or khan ruled over three principal 
provinces, seven dependent kingdoms, and seven tributary tribes. The chief 
province, Kwalis, was centred on the twin cities of Amol-Atil on the Lower 
Volga (the site of the future Tsaritsyn). Semender en the River Terek had 
been the dynasty's earlier refuge after their expulsion from Turkestan. Sarkel 
was centred on the River Don, west of the Volga bend. It was ruled from a 
stone city of the same name built by ninth-century Byzantine engineers. 

Of the dependent kingdoms, by far the most important was Khotzir in 
Crimea, the Khazars' new headquarters. It had succeeded the realm of the 
Goths, who in turn had conquered the ancient Hellenistic 'Kingdom of the 
Bosphorus', [chersonesos] It was ruled from Phullai, modern Planerskoe, 
on the coast; and it possessed a strong Jewish community active in the Black 
Sea trade. Other dependencies included Hun on the River Sulak (home of 
Attila's descendants), Onogur on the Kama, Turkoi or Levedia on the Donets 
(home of the future Magyars), and three divisions of the Volga Bulgars. Of 
the tributary tribes in the northern forest zone, three were ethnically Slavic, 
three Finnic, and one unidentified. 

Khazaria was famed for its commerce and for its religious tolerance. It 




was the traditional supplier of Slav slaves to the Mediterranean market (see 
p. 257); and in the tenth century an overland trade route began to develop 
along the line of Regensburg-Vienna-Cracow-Kiev-Atil. 

Muslim, Christian, Jewish, and pagan religions all flourished under their 
own communal judges. The Khazar army was largely drawn from Iranian 
Muslims from the eastern province; and in 737 the Khan himself adopted 
Islam. But some time soon afterwards his successors converted to Judaism 
and made it the state religion. This conversion, surprisingly, finds no echo in 
contemporary Byzantine, Arabic, or Jewish sources; but it was already 
known to the monk Druthmar of Aquitaine, writing at Corvey in Westphalia 
in 864: 

For in the lands of Gog and Magog, who are a Hunnish race and call 
themselves Gazari, there is one tribe, a very belligerent one... and all of 
them profess the Jewish faith. 1 

During the period of Arab expansion in the seventh to ninth centuries, 
Khazaria generally allied itself with Byzantium against the Arabs. During 
the Viking era, Scandinavians opened up the Baltic-Dnieper route, mastered 
Kiev, and possibly took over the khanate as a whole, [rus'] 

Jewish historians have naturally shown immense interest in Khazaria's 
conversion to Judaism. Judah Halevi (1075-1141), writing in Toledo, 
idealized the Khazar Khan as a hero of the faith. The Karaites of Crimea 
called the Khazars mamzer, meaning 'bastard' or 'false Jews'. But the 
Karaite scholar Abraham Firkovich (1785-1874) claimed that the Khazars 
had been Karaites. Arthur Koestler, writing in the 1970s, claimed that 
migrant Jewish Khazars begat the main body of Ashkenazy Jewry in Central 
Europe. 2 The Khazar puzzle is still not fully solved. 

Yet Khazaria lives on. In Greece, children do not wait at Christmas time 
for Santa Claus bringing gifts from Lapland. They wait for St Basil, coming 
from Khazaria. 


In Spain, for example, the romanized Celto-Iberians received a significant 
injection of Germanics-with important Moorish and Jewish layers to follow. In 
Gaul, the Gallo-Romans received a stronger but uneven Germanic overlay- 




heavy in the north-east, light in the south-west. In Italy, too, the latinized Celto- 
Italics and Greeks imbibed a strong Germanic element, that was predominant in 
the north. In Britain, the Romano-British population was either absorbed or 
displaced, leaving two distinct communities-Celtic in the west, Germanic in the 
east, centre, and south. Caledonia (Scotland) was divided between the Germanic 
lowlanders and the Celtic highlanders. In Germany, the balance between west 
Germanic and east Germanic tribes shifted decisively in the former's favour, 
since most of the latter had migrated. The Slavonic peoples took decisive control 
not only of the largest sector of the northern plain but also of the Balkans. Within 
the new Slavonic homelands, however, many non-Slavonic peoples, including 
the Vlachs, remained.- 

Ethnic changes were inevitably reflected in language. The vulgar Latin 
which had been the lingua franca of the late Western Empire, was gradually 
broken down into a bevy of bowdlerized neo-latinate idioms-from Portuguese 
to Romanian. Latin pater drifted towards padre in Spanish and Italian, towards 
pere in French, towards tata in Romanian. 

The linguistic transitions were very slow. In the case of French, the vulgar 
Latin vernacular romanz of Gaul passed through three distinct phases-(eighth 
century), Old French (eleventh), Middle French (fourteenth)-before a 
recognizable variety of modern French was achieved. New grammar and new 
word-forms evolved as the old Latin declensions, conjugations, and inflexions 
were dropped. Bonum, bonam, bonas moved towards bon, bonne, bonnes. Rex 
became le roi; amat changed to aime, regina to la reine. The earliest text in 
'Romance', the Strasbourg Oath, dates from 843-by which time the kings of 
France had stopped speaking Germanic Frankish altogether. Britain was one of 
several ex-Roman provinces where Latin was completely wiped out. 

Greek persisted in the Eastern Empire, both as the official language and in 
many places, especially in Asia Minor, as the vernacular. But several areas, 
including the Peloponnese, were for a period wholly or partly slavicized. One 
should be wary of oversimplification. But the thesis advanced by the Bavarian 
scholar, Jakub Fallmerayer (1790-1861), in Ueber die Entstehung der 
Neugriechen (1835), merits attention. Fallmerayer's work, which caused deep 
trauma amidst the Greeks of his day, argued that the Greek nation of modern 
times was largely descended from hellenized Albanians and Slavs, 'with hardly a 
drop of tme Greek blood in their veins'. This may have been an exaggeration; 
but it is less absurd than the notion that every modern Greek is a direct ethnic 


descendant of the inhabitants of ancient Greece. No modern European nation can 
lay reasonable claim to undiluted 'ethnic purity', [makedon] 

The dispersal of the Slavs encouraged the evolution of the three main 
Slavonic linguistic groups, and the well-springs of a dozen Slavonic languages. 
(See Appendix III, p. 1233.) 

By the eighth century, therefore, the ethnic settlement of the Peninsula was 
beginning to achieve a lasting pattern. The eighth century, indeed, was the point 
when important social crystallizations occurred. Yet five more major migrations 
had to happen before all the basic population of the future Europe was complete. 
One of these five later migrant groups, the Vikings, were sea-raiders (see p. 
293). Two more, the Magyars and the Mongols, were nomads (see pp. 296-8). 
Two others, the Moors and the Turks, were warriors of a new religion (see pp. 
253, 386). Europe was conceived from the most diverse elements, and her birth 
was painfully protracted. 

The Empire: From Rome to Byzantium, 330-867 

From 330 onwards, ruled from the Bosporus, the Roman Empire changed its 
character. The Romanitas, the 'Latinity', of the empire was inevitably reduced. 
But political priorities shifted as well: henceforth the heartland lay not in Italy 
but in the Balkans and in Asia Minor. The provinces which lay nearest to the 
emperors' concerns were not Gaul or Spain or Africa, but Egypt, Syria, even 
Armenia. Increasingly, the frontier to be defended at all costs lay not on the 
Rhine but on the lower Danube and the Pontic shore. Recognizing the shift, most 
historians drop the title of 'Roman Empire' in favour of 'Byzantine Empire'. The 
emperors and their subjects, however, continued to think of themselves as 
'Romans'. Constantine had no intention of abandoning anything but a decayed 
capital city. The growing divergence of East and West was so slow that it was 
virtually imperceptible to contemporaries. For them, it was far less impressive 
than the sturdy strands of continuity. 

What is more, there is no general consensus about the point where 'Rome' 
was truly supplanted by 'Byzantium'. In its origins, the split can be traced back 
to Octavius and Mark Antony, whose rivalry had briefly divided the Roman 
world for the first time. In which case the gradual emergence of Byzantium, and 
the supremacy of the East, might be seen as belated compensation for the 
tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra. Diocletian, who deliberately chose the Eastern 



half of the Empire for himself, has been proposed as 'the first Byzantine 
Emperor'. Other obvious contenders for the title would be Constantine, founder 
of Constantinople, Justinian, and Heraclius. At the other extreme, some 
historians might withhold the 'Byzantine' label until the Empire's last links with 
the West were severed. In which case one would be talking of the ninth century, 
or even of the eleventh, when the Greek Church of the East finally parted 
company with the Latin Church of Rome. In this view, 'Byzantium' is not the 
foil to the Rome of late antiquity but rather to the 'Holy Roman Empire' of the 
Middle Ages. 

This period of transition lasted for half a millennium. In the fourth and fifth 
centuries, the Empire's links with the Western provinces were weakened to the 
point where imperial rule in the West was abandoned. The last remnants of 
ancient paganism were suppressed. In the sixth century there was a concerted 
attempt under Justinian (r. 527-65) to restore the Western connection, but it 
ended in failure. Then, with the influx of Bulgars and Slavs, the remnants of the 
Empire's Latin-speaking population were overwhelmed. Byzantium was left 
entirely Greek. In the seventh century, the valuable Eastern provinces were 
overrun by the Arabs; and the territorial base of the Empire shrank to something 
remarkably akin to that of the ancient Greek world prior to Alexander's 
conquests (see Map 5). In the eighth century, when the Arab tide was ebbing, the 
Empire was shaken by an amazingly protracted religious furore over icons, 
which was one of the sources of the schism between Eastern and Western 
Christianity. Protracted wars with the fearsome Bulgars were not damped down 
before a Bulgar khan had quaffed his wine from an emperor's skull. The 
Iconoclast controversy came to an end in 842-3. Relations with Bulgars reached 
an important turning-point in 865, when their warleader was baptized by the 
Patriarch of Constantinople. Five hundred years of turmoil were moving to a 
close. At that date, the Roman Empire stood within two years of the founding of 
the great Macedonian dynasty, whose emperors were to bring it to a new apogee. 
Over the previous five centuries, the long procession of external and internal 
crises had changed the political, social, religious, and cultural life of the Empire 
out of all recognition. By then, if not before, Byzantium had truly succeeded the 
Roman world in every sense. 

The fifth-century collapse of the Empire's Western provinces came as the 
result of long decay. It is doubtful whether the barbarian invasions did more than 
catalyse a process which was already well advanced. Some, like Gibbon, have 
stressed the decadent luxury of the ruling class. Others have stressed socio- 



economic factors-monetary and price inflation, over-taxation, bureaucracy, 
agricultural decline, which in turn produced what Ferdinand Lot called 'a regime 
of castes'. Ossification of the social strata was accompanied by 'a total 
transformation of human psychology'. 2 Here above all was the classic case of 
imperial 'overstretch': the Empire could not sustain the military effort 
indefinitely. The imperial armies were so saturated by barbarian soldiers and ex¬ 
barbarian generals that the old distinction between Roman and non-Roman 
became increasingly irrelevant. 

Yet the moment of truth was slow in coming. In the fourth century, 
Constantine's successors were at least as alarmed by the Persians as by the 
western barbarians. Julian (r. 361-3), having spent many years in Gaul restoring 
the Rhine garrisons, was slain in Mesopotamia. Valentinian I (r. 364-75) again 
divided the Empire in order to continue Julian's work in Gaul. Theodosius I (r. 
378-96), son of a general, managed the crisis caused by the Ostrogothic invasion 
(see p. 229), and was the last to restore imperial unity. After his death, the 
division between East and West was made permanent, and the Western provinces 
were allowed to drift away. Of Honorius (r. 395-423), who ruled in Milan, at 
first under the regency of Stilicho the Vandal, it was said that he knew nothing of 
'Roma' beyond the fact that it was the name of his pet chicken. 

The last act of the Empire in the West, in 476, is instructive. A boy-emperor 
with the symbolic name of Romulus Augustulus was the latest puppet to be 
elevated to the imperial dignity by the squabbling army factions. But a 
delegation of the Roman senate, which travelled to Constantinople to obtain the 
usual agreement from the Eastern Emperor, did not ask for Romulus Augustulus 
to be confirmed. Instead, they begged the Emperor Zeno (474-91) to accept the 
over-lordship of the West for himself, whilst granting the title of Patrician to 
Odoacer, the barbarian general who actually controlled Italy at the time. In this 
way the principle of imperial rule was upheld in theory, though all practical 
government was surrendered. For centuries after 476, therefore, the emperors in 
Constantinople were able to maintain their claim to supreme authority in the 
West. None of the barbarian rulers in the ex-imperial provinces paid much 
attention to the claim. But its existence may explain why any alternative source 
of supreme authority was so slow to develop, [palaeo] 

Overall, therefore, the Empire's strategy was more to absorb the barbarian 
challenge than to attempt any decisive solution. The problem was too large to be 
neatly solved. The emperors exacted tribute, both in money and in recognition, 


from the invaders. They settled them where possible in the lands they demanded, 
or acquiesced where necessary. They employed a whole gallery of barbarian 
generals-from Stilicho the Vandal to Odoacer of the Heruli-and recruited 
masses of barbarian soldiery, which steadily subverted political life in the 
Western provinces. In the end, it was largely immaterial whether the emperor 
gave his blessing to a puppet Caesar elected by barbarian troops or to a barbarian 
king. Yet it is important to realize that the Roman Empire was not destroyed by 
the barbarian invasions. It reeled under the blows and suffered great losses, both 
in territory and influence. But it held together for almost a thousand years after 
476, and it succeeded in reasserting itself on several notable occasions. To 
suggest otherwise is simply to succumb to Western prejudice, [teichos] 


PALAEO 


In the fourth century a form of uncials or 'inch-high letters' made their 
appearance in the writing of the late Roman Empire. They were generally 
smaller, rounder, and more suited to the requirements of pen than imperial 
forms had been. They long coexisted with the traditional Latin script which 
used 'square' and later 'rustic' capitals without punctuation or gaps between 
words. But it was the start of the long process of evolution of Latin writing 
which led from the uncial and half-uncial stage, through Caroline minuscule 
and Gothic to the humanistic miniscule and italic of the Renaissance period.

Palaeography, the study of ancient writing, is one of the auxiliary sciences 
vital to the historian's and archivist's craft. It often provides the only means 
for judging where, when, and by whom a document was written. Every 
period, every location, and every scribe reveal their own peculiarities. 1 
Greek, Cyrillic, and Arabic scripts passed through similar evolutions to those 
of Latin. All moved away from early formal styles to the cursive forms of 
later times. The records of the Ottoman chancelleries, written in an eccentric 
Turkish variant of Arabic, have the reputation of being unusually hard to 
decipher. (See Appendix III, p. 1227.) 

Though the invention of printing, and later of typewriters, greatly 
facilitated the deciphering of documents, palaeography never became 
redundant. Many letters and diaries continued to be written by hand. In 1990 
a team of German tricksters almost convinced the world that they had found 
the long-lost diaries of Adolf Hitler. The palaeographical skills of the forger 
exceeded those of the distinguished English professor who was hired to 
check his work. 2 


Justinian (r. 527-65) is mainly remembered for his codification of Roman 
law, and for a determined attempt to reassert imperial rule over the lost Western 
provinces. His legal reforms were certainly a lasting achievement; but from the 
standpoint of the Empire as a whole his preoccupations in the West must have 
seemed something of a diversion from more pressing matters. Justinian's reign 
saw the Slavs appear on the Adriatic, and the Persians on the Mediterranean 
shore of the Levant. Constantinople was decimated by plague, and by the strife 
of the hippodrome factions, the Blues and the Greens. It was besieged by the 
Slavs in 540 and by the Avars in 562. Justinian caused an early scandal by 
marrying a so-called dancer called Theodora, the daughter of a Cypriot manager 
of the Greens. According to the Secret History attributed to Procopius, Theodora 
once regretted That God had not endowed her with more orifices to give more 
pleasure to more people at the same time'. But she turned out to be an active and 
intelligent consort; it was a famous partnership. (See Appendix III, p. 1237.) 

Justinian's reconquest of the West centred on the exploits of his general, 
Belisarius, who set out on his first expedition to Africa in 533. His surprising 
success in destroying the Vandal kingdom at a stroke encouraged him to attack 
the Ostrogoths in Sicily and Italy. An isolated army of 7,500 men advanced on a 




realm which boasted 100,000 Germanic warriors. In 535 Belisarius took Palermo 
as reigning consul, and on 9 December 536 he entered Rome at the request of its 
frantic bishop. There, in 537-8, he withstood a mighty siege, where the walls of 
Aurelian held off the horde. At the critical moment, the defenders broke the 
heads of the Goths by hurling down the marble statues of gods and emperors 
ripped from Hadrian's mausoleum. In 540 Belisarius took the Gothic capital of 
Ravenna. But thirteen years of war remained. Rome was subjected to two more 
punishing sieges. The occupation by Totila in 546 proved far more destructive 
than anything inflicted by Alaric or Genseric. The Gothic troops breached the 
walls, burned the gates, and deported the citizens. Most ominously, they 
smashed the arches of the aqueducts. Tor forty days the imperial city was given 
up to the wolf and the owl.'- Then fortunes were reversed once more. In 553 the 
campaign of Narses, an ageing eunuch of the Palace, completed what Belisarius 
had begun: Italy was restored as an imperial province with a governor at 
Ravenna; the Ostrogoths and their horde were dispersed. In 554, the imperialists 
attacked Spain, driving the Visigoths into the central plateau and re-establishing 
a Roman province in the south. 

On the face of it, Justinian had restored the Empire to much of its former 
glory. The Mediterranean, once again, was a Roman lake. Yet the glory was 
superficial: 'Reste une grandeur caduque, meme malfaisante' (the grandeur 
which remained was decrepit, even noxious). s Italy in particular was so ruined 
by Justinian's wars, so oppressed by his governors and tax-collectors, that the 
inhabitants soon regretted the restoration. The Patriarch of Rome, resentful of 
interference in his ecclesiastical freedom, was driven to think of permanent 
separation. What is more, with the destruction of the Gothic horde, Italy had lost 
its defences. It fell an easy prey to the next wave of invaders-the Lombards. 
Apart from the lonely exarchate of Ravenna, the only parts to remain in imperial 
hands were in the south and in Sicily. Meanwhile all sorts of other enemies were 
looming on the horizon. In the fifth, sixth, and seventh centuries Constantinople 
was repeatedly attacked. Huns, Ostrogoths, Avars, Slavs, Persians, and Arabs all 
made their bid for the ultimate prize. The Huns under Attila had ridden for the 
Bosporus on their outward journey. They reached the walls of Constantinople in 
441. The Ostrogoths under Theodoric arrived after their victory at Adrianople. 
They reached the walls in 476. 


TEICHOS 


An inscription on the Porta Rhegium records the reconstruction of the Land 
Walls of Constantinople in ad 447. A recent earthquake had seriously 
damaged the third line of the city's fortifications, which had been built by 
the Regent Artemius, thirty years earlier; and repairs and renovations were 
urgently required. The Huns were on the Danube frontier, and had already 
made one successful sortie to the Bosporus. As a result, a magnificent, 
multi-tiered system of defences was erected in the last years of Theodosius 
II, all the way from the Golden Gate to the Golden Horn. The main rampart 
of the Artemesian Wall was raised to a height of 100 feet above the 
surrounding countryside; a massive, battlemented protective wall was 
erected in front of it, providing a high terraced walkway; an outer esplanade 
guarded by a third line of battlements separated the walls from a broad, 
brick-lined moat. The whole was equipped with ninety-six major bastions, a 
host of lesser watch-towers, and a maze of traps, dams, sally-points, and 
false approaches. Though numerous extensions and alterations were made to 
the city's defences at other more vulnerable points, it was the main 
Theodosian Walls, the great Teichos, which withstood the repeated attacks of 
the barbarians for more than a thousand years. 1 (See Map 9.) 

There is no scene more redolent of Christendom's early centuries than 
this great fortress of the Christian empire, magnificently impregnable against 
the puny attempts of all attackers. The Visigoths came and went empty- 
handed in 378, the Huns in 441, the Ostrogoths in 476. The Slavs tried and 
failed in 540, the Persians in 609-10, 617-26, and again in 781, the Avars in 
625. The Arabs laid unsuccessful siege in 673-8, and 717-18, the Bulgars in 
813 and 913, the Rus in 865 and 904, the Pechenegs in 1087, and the 
Venetians in 1203. The Crusaders broke into Constantinople in April 1204 
from the seaward side (see p. 360). But the Theodosian Walls remained 
intact until the Ottoman siege of 1453. Their fall was to mark not only the 
end of the Roman Empire but the beginning of modern military history. 
Gunpowder seriously modified the art of fortification. (See pp. 448-50). 

To stand by the Golden Gate at sunset is one of the most moving of 
experiences for any historian. Originally built by Theodosius I as a threefold 



triumphal arch beyond the city, the Porta aurea was incorporated into the 
Walls in 417; but it continued to serve as the starting station of the imperial 
processional route. (It is now the Yedi Kuleh, the Fortress of the Seven 
Towers, at the entrance to Istanbul.) In the eyes of the defenders, the 
barbarians, like the last rays of the setting sun, always came from the West. 


Seen from Constantinople, the Slavs must have raised excitements like the 
Celtic and Germanic tribes had once raised in Rome. Though less well reported, 
their crossing of the Danube in 551 must have resembled the earlier surge of the 
Germanics across the Rhine. The impact was certainly similar. Whole provinces 
of the Empire-Illyria, Dalmatia, Macedonia, and Thrace-were turned into one 
vast Sclavinia or 'Slavdom'. They so overwhelmed the Latin-speaking 
population that only small pockets were left-as Daco-Romans (Romanians) 
north of the Danube, or as scattered communities of 'Vlachs' to the south. They 
provided the main ethnic component of three later principalities carved out of 
former imperial territory-Croatia, Serbia, and greater Bulgaria. Sailing on 
primitive one-log boats, they even penetrated the Greek islands. They reached 
the walls of Constantinople in 540. 

Persia had seen a major revival of its fortunes since the days of Alexander's 
successors. Under the Sassanid dynasty, the eastern frontiers of Rome were 
ceaselessly contested. Under Ardashir I (r. 227-41) and again under the two 
Khosrus (also known as Chosroes)-Khosru I (r. 531-79) and Khosru II (r. 590- 
628), Persian resurgence reached the point where the latter could claim 
possession of the Mediterranean in a 'ceremony of the sea' performed near 
Antioch. They reached the walls in 609-10 and again in 625-6. The Avars made 
for the Bosporus, having been driven down the Danube by the Franks. They 
joined the Persians at the walls in 625. The Arabs poured out of the east like a 
desert sandstorm (see p. 253). They reached the walls in 673, and again in 717. 
[teichos] 

Heraclius (575-641) is the best-backed candidate for the title of 'first of the 
Byzantines'. He had none of Justinian's Western interests, and he gave the state a 
distinctly oriental flavour. He spent most of his reign dealing with one great 
enemy, only to find another more formidable to hand. In 617 the Persian host of 
Chosroes II marched to the Hellespont and called on Constantinople to 
surrender. They had already captured Damascus and Jerusalem (614), where they 




had seized the True Cross; and by occupying Egypt they had cut off the Empire's 
corn dole-another relic of Roman times. It was a confrontation between Europe 
and Asia worthy of Herodotus: 

Chosroes, greatest of Gods, and master of the earth, to Heraclius, his vile and 
insensate slave. Why do you still... call yourself a king? But I will pardon your 
faults if you submit ... Do not deceive yourself with vain hope in that Christ, 
who was not able to save himself from the Jews, who killed him by nailing him 
to a cross. Even if you take refuge in the depths of the sea, I will stretch out my 
hand and take you.. .- 

At which point the Avars rode in to landward and, having ambushed the 
Emperor before the walls, had to be bought off. 

Yet in 622 Heraclius was able to launch a series of masterful campaigns that 
have been called the 'first crusade'. A great Christian army marched to 
Jerusalem. Leaving Constantinople to the Perso-Avar siege, he led his troops into 
the heart of Persia, plundered the palace of Chosroes at Dastager, near 
Ctesiphon, and, as the crowning clause of the Peace in 628, recovered the True 
Cross. He was hailed in Constantinople as 'the new Scipio'. If he had died then, 
he would have gone down in history as the greatest Roman general since Caesar. 

In fact, Heraclius had softened up both the Roman and the Persian empires 
for the Muslim onslaught. When the armies of Islam appeared in the 630s, he 
could do nothing to hold them. Jerusalem, saved from the Persians, fell to the 
Arabs in 638. Three years later, with Heraclius on his death bed, the Empire's 
wealthiest province in Egypt was on the point of falling. The first round in 
Byzantium's 800-year war with Islam had been lost. None the less, all the main 
outlines of Byzantine identity were present. The Empire's territory was reduced 
to its Greek heartland. The Greek language was the sole vehicle of culture. And 
the Patriarch of Constantinople, after the loss of his colleagues in Jerusalem, 
Antioch, and Alexandria, was left as the unchallenged leader of the Greek 
Church. The initial conflict with the Arabs raged for decades. There were two 
more great sieges of Constantinople, each broken by the supremacy of the 
imperial fleet and the 'Greek fire'. There were numberless skirmishes and 
rearguard actions in the islands and the provinces. Roman Armenia was lost in 
636, Cyprus in 643, Rhodes in 655, Carthage in 698. The Saracen wars of 
Justinian II (r. 685-95 and 705-11) reflected the general chaos of the age. After 


one battle, he ordered his guards to slaughter the only unit of his troops who had 
not deserted, to prevent them from deserting in the next. After the fall of Rhodes, 
the remains of the fallen Colossus were sold to a Jewish dealer for scrap. It was a 
sign of the times. 

Iconodasm-'image-breaking'-was a movement which gripped the Empire 
in the eighth and early ninth centuries, and which in some respects was a 
sympathetic reaction to the puritanical values of Islam. At one level it involved a 
purely religious controversy over the place of images in Christian worship. The 
Iconoclasts followed the Muslim example in banning all representational art, 
accusing their opponents of iconoduly-'idolatry'. An edict of Leo I the Isaurian 
in 726 decreed that the crucifix be everywhere replaced by a plain Cross. And in 
due course the order was given for all images of the saints, and especially of the 
Virgin Mary, to be whitewashed. At another level, however, a deep social and 
political struggle was in progress. By attacking iconodulous monasteries and 
sequestrating their considerable properties, the Iconoclast emperors were 
strengthening the hold of the State over the Church. Equally, they could be seen 
to be asserting Constantinople's control over wayward provinces, especially in 
Europe. The chief Iconoclast, Constantine Copronymos (r. 740-75), 'hammer of 
the monks', was confirmed in his position in 754 by the packed Council of 
Constantinople, which was roundly anathematized by Rome. At one point all the 
monks and nuns of Thrace were assembled, and given the choice between instant 
marriage or exile in Cyprus. The Emperor survived open rebellion, engaging 
himself in victorious campaigns in Mesopotamia and in public works, [ikon] 

The war of the images, however, was far from finished. Both the Empress 
Irena (r. 797-802) and Theodora, wife of Theophilus (r. 829-42), were ardent 
icono-dules. Theodora's son, Michael III (r. 842-67), among many scandalous 
acts, exhumed and burned the body of Constantine Copronymos. Iconodasm 
was proscribed. Religious peace had to await the murder of Michael, and the 
emergence of the Macedonian dynasty in 867. By that time, much damage had 
been done. Iconodasm must be seen as one of the key factors which disrupted 
the bond between the Patriarchs of Constantinople and Rome, and which drove 
the Latin Church into the arms of the Franks. 

In that same era, the Bulgars rose to a position of great power in the Balkans. 
Their ancestral chieftain, Kourat, had been an ally of Heraclius; and some time 
later they were settied on the Black Sea coast south of the Danube. In 717-18 
they helped the Empire repel the Arab siege. They conquered seven Slav tribes 



of the locality, only to adopt the language and customs of the conquered. In the 
ninth century the warlike Krum declared war on the Empire and on Christianity. 
It was he, having slain the Emperor Nicephorus in 811, who toasted his victory 
in the emperor's skull. He forced Byzantium to build the 'Great Fence'-a new 
Roman limes. His successor, Boris, though baptized in Constantinople, was 
balancing his loyalties between the Greek and the Roman Churches. (See 
Appendix III, p. 1245.) 

Byzantine civilization, as established by the ninth century, possessed several 
inimitable features which set it apart both from contemporary states in the West 
and from the earlier Roman Empire. The state and the church were fused into 
one indivisible whole. The Emperor, the autokrator, and the Patriarch were seen 
as the secular and the ecclesiastical pillars of divine authority. The Empire 
defended the Orthodox Church, and the Church praised the Empire. This 
'Caesaropapism' had no equal in the West, where secular rule and papal 
authority had never been joined, [taxis] 

The imperial court was the hub of a vast centralized administration run by an 
army of bureaucrats. Heraclius had taken the Persian tide of Basileus, and the 
despotic nature of the state machine was self-evident in its oriental ceremonies. 
'Byzantium' became a byword for total subservience, secretiveness, and intrigue. 
The shell of some of the old Roman institutions was retained but was completely 
subordinated. The senate was an assembly of office-holders, organized in a strict 
table of ranks. The chief ministers of state under the eparchos (prefect), 
symponus (chancellor), and logothete (chief justice) were offset by the chief 
officers of the court, all eunuchs, under the Paracomoenus (high chamberlain). 
By castrating its leading courtiers, the Empire protected itself neatly from the 
possibility of hereditary power in the palace, as often happened in the West. 
Military defence was divided between a central imperial reserve and guard of 
foreign mercenaries, commanded by the domestikos, and a system of themes or 
'military regions', each commanded by its strategos. 


IKON 


Religious icons form the most enduring genre of European Art. But they 




were never painted primarily as artistic works. They are aids to devotion. 
They are 'gates of mystery', 'doors of perception' into the spiritual world 
beyond the images. Their appreciation depends on the theological 
knowledge and the emotional receptiveness of the viewer. 1 The Byzantine 
Empire long protected the leading centres, though the medieval West later 
produced important schools of its own. 

The posture demanded from the venerator of icons is summed up by the 
Greek word hesychia or 'watchful calm'. It requires patience, detachment, 
humility, and prayerful concentration. The Philokalia, a 5th-century 
Byzantine treatise and anthology of texts on 'the Love of the Beautiful', 
likens it to a cat transfixed by the task of catching a mouse. 

Legend holds that St Luke was the first icon-painter, his subject the 
Virgin and Child. (See Plate 22.) Together with 'Christus Pantokrator', the 
Virgin always headed the repertoire. She appeared in three standard positions 
-the eleus, where She holds the Child to her face; the odititria, where She 
holds the Child on her outstretched arm; and the orakta, where her arms are 
raised and the Child is in her womb. 2 

During the long Iconomachia, the 'War of the Icons', St John Damascene 
(675-749) was the greatest of the Iconophiles or 'Iconodules', i.e. 'slaves of 
the Icon'. Yet he stressed the distinction between the veneration of icons and 
the more profound adoration of God which icons facilitate. He also defined 
the three-level theological theory of images. Christ became Man; Man was 
made in the image of God; icons, therefore, were true images of the 
Godhead and the Saints. 

Icons have always held a central place in Orthodox churches. The 
iconostasis or 'icon screen' separates the congregation from the church's 
sanctuary, reserved for the clergy. It traditionally carried four rows of icons 
which represent, respectively, the company of saints at the top, the twelve 
feasts of the Church, the Twelve Apostles, and the twelve prophets. In the 
centre, the double doors are covered by six panels representing the 
Archangel Gabriel, the Mother of God, and the Pour Evangelists. In Greece, 
they are 'The Gates of Beauty', in Russia 'the Imperial Gates'. They are 
surmounted by the three larger icons of God in Judgement, the Trinity, and 
the Crucifixion. During an Orthodox service, an icon is often paraded 
through the Church to be kissed by the faithful. 

Icons are painted on portable wooden boards. The painters use pure egg 



tempera colours on a white or gilded surface. Stylized postures, gestures, and 
faces convey the requisite air of reverence. 3 The disregard for perspective is 
characteristic, [flagellatio] 

Orthodox icon-painting passed through several distinct periods. The first 
'Golden Age' ended with the Iconoclast controversy. Few specimens 
survive. The second period ended with the Latin conquest of Byzantium in 
1204. The late Byzantine period saw the growth of national schools in 
Bulgaria, Serbia, and Russia. Novgorod, Belarus, and Pskov all possessed 
their own traditions until the latterday Russian Orthodox Church imposed an 
obligatory Muscovite style. Since then, Orthodox iconography has been 
remarkably insulated from developments in Catholic art. None the less, some 
important cross-fertilization did take place. A unique 'composite Veneto- 
Byzantine style' emerged in Crete. A similar blend of Catholic and Orthodox 
imagery can be observed in Ukrainian Uniate Art. 4 [greco] 

Despite the Church Schism (see pp. 328-32), Orthodox icons continued 
to be highly valued in the West. All the famous 'Black Madonnas' of 
Catholic Europe derive from Byzantine sources, [madonna] So, too, does 
the 'Holy Face' of Laon in Picardy, another extraordinary black icon, this 
time of Christ. Strongly reminiscent of 'The Shroud of Turin', the Sainte- 
Face is classed as a mandylion, that is, an image produced without human 
hands. Though painted on pineboards, it bears an incongruous Slavonic 
inscription-OBRAS' GOSPODEN NAUBRUS' (The Image of Our Lord 
on Cloth), probably of Serbian origin. It could be a copy of the Holy Shroud 
once displayed in Byzantium. At all events, it was obtained by Jacques de 
Troyes, archdeacon of Laon and the future Pope Urban IV, from 'certain 
pious men' at the Serbian monastery in Bari in southern Italy. According to a 
surviving letter dated 3 July 1249, the archdeacon sent it as a gift to his sister 
Sibylle, abbess of the Cistercian convent of Montreuil, whence it duly found 
its way to the Cathedral at Laon. 5 

Icons are honoured in all devout Orthodox households. Maxim Gorky 
recalled his grandparents' house in Nizhny Novgorod in the 1870s: 

When [my Grandmother] talked about God, her face regained its youth... . I 
took the heavy locks of her hair in my hands, and wound them round my 
neck. 'Man can't see God,' she said 'if he did, he'd go blind. Only the Saints 
can look him full in the face.' To see her wipe the dust from the icons and 



clean the chasubles was very interesting.... She would nimbly pick an icon 
up, smile at it, and say with great feeling 'What a lovely face!' Then she 
would cross herself, and kiss the icon. 6 


TAXIS 

In September 641 Constans II was crowned by the Patriarch of 
Constantinople in the ambo of St Sophia, 'the Great Church'. The old 
Roman practice of acclaiming a new emperor in the Hippodrome was 
abandoned. The most important politico-religious ceremony in the Byzantine 
repertoire was finding its final form. Henceforth a diadem was laid on the 
Emperor's head, instead of the traditional torque round his neck. Largesse 
was distributed; coins were struck. Co-emperors were crowned by emperors, 
empresses by their husbands. Conventional icono-graphic representations of 
the ceremony showed the emperors being crowned by Christ. 

Political ritual played a central role in Byzantine life. Its aim was to 
reinforce the ideal of taxis, the changeless, harmonious, and hierarchical 
'order of things'. Elaborate spectacles were designed with immense concern 
for symbolic detail. Processions and public parades were organized on the 
slightest pretext, above all on Christian feast days. Imperial acclamations 
were accompanied by the chanting of Biblical texts and political slogans, by 
the declamation of poems and panegyrics, and by mighty shouts, which 
contrasted with the total silence that the Emperor's presence otherwise 
required. Imperial bride-shows, weddings, and funerals were orchestrated 
with suitable shows of joy or lamentation. Imperial audiences were 
meticulously graded according to the status of the visitor. The exact distance 
between the throne and the prostrations of the visitor was prescribed in 
advance. The imperial Adventus or 'arrival' demanded calibration of the rank 
of the delegates sent out to meet him, the site and form of the greeting, the 
route into the city, the choice of church for the thanksgiving service, and the 
menu for the banquet. The imperial Profectio or 'departure', especially for 
battle, was marked by the distribution of alms, by the veneration of the 
Standard of the True Cross, and by the consecration of the army and the 




fleet. The Thriambus or 'Imperial Triumph', as inherited from Rome, 
involved displays of troops, captives, and booty, games and races in the 
Circus and Hippodrome, and the tra-chelismos or ritual trampling of the 
defeated enemy or usurper. The promotions of high officials were staged in a 
manner that left no doubt of the source of their success. 

On all occasions, great attention was paid to clothing, to the insignia of 
office, to colour, and to gesture. Robing and disrobing ceremonies opened 
and closed all processions. The imperial crown, orb, sceptre, and akakia, the 
'pouch of dust' symbolizing mortality, were always given prominence. The 
wearing of the purple was reserved for the Emperor and, in iconography, for 
Christ and the Virgin Mary. Byzantine body language stressed the ideal of 
agalma or 'statuesque calm'. 1 

The most complete compendium of Byzantine ritual is to be found in the 
tenth-century manuscript De Ceremom 'is aulae byzantinae or 'The Book of 
Ceremonies of the Byzantine Court'. 2 It contains 153 chapters or dossiers of 
instructions relating to practices and procedures over 600 years. It prescribes 
everything from the rules of dance and address to the length of the 
Emperor's haircut. 3 Imperial ceremonial was imitated and adapted by 
Patriarchs, by provincial administrators, by generals, by bishops, and 
eventually by rulers throughout the Christian world. In time, it supplied the 
basis for all sorts of monarchical and ecclesiastical symbolism far beyond 
the Empire. Charlemagne, for example, copied much from Byzantium, just 
as other Western sovereigns copied much from Charlemagne. 3 [kral] 

Not all, however, was one-way traffic. The practice of raising the 
Emperor aloft on the shields of his troops was borrowed from the Germanic 
tribes. It was first used by Julian in Paris in 361, and lasted, with intervals 
until the eighth century. The ceremony of chrisma, 'anointment with holy 
oil', seems to have been first adopted by the Franks and introduced to 
Constantinople by Crusaders in the thirteenth century. 4 By that time, the 
Christianization of monarchical ritual in Europe was universal. 


Byzantium, however, was primarily a naval power. Its navy of 300 biremes, 
armed with battering rams and the 'Greek fire', could hold its own against all 
comers. Despite the great battle with the Arabs off Phoenix in Lycia in 655, 




Byzantine sea-power continued to dominate the Aegean and the Black Sea. 

The Byzantine state practised unremitting paternalism in social and 
economic affairs. Trade was controlled by state officials, who exacted a straight 
10 per cent tax on all exports and imports. State regulations governed all aspects 
of guild and industrial life. State factories, such as the gynaceum, the women's 
silk-works, guaranteed full employment within the walls. The imperial gold 
coinage-1 nomisma = 12 milliaressia = 144 pholes -supplied the main 
international currency of the East. Such was the abundance of the state-run 
fisheries in the Black Sea that the workers of Constantinople regularly ate caviar. 

Under its mantle of Greek culture, Byzantium sheltered a multinational 
community of the most diverse ethnic origins. Imperial brides could be Khazars, 
Franks, Rus. The population was Graeco-Slav in the Balkans, post-hellenic and 
Armenian in the Asian provinces. Beyond the serf villages of the countryside, 
Byzantine society was highly educated and refined. There was provision for 
church schools, state universities, academies of law, and for female education. 
Devotional literature predominated. But the tenth-century Digenis Akritas has 
been described as The most splendid chanson de geste ever written', and 
Byzantine historians from Procopius to Anna Porphyrogeneta (1083-1154) as 
The finest school... between Ancient Rome and modern Europe'. Byzantine art 
and architecture developed absolutely inimitable styles. Despite or perhaps 
because of the iconoclastic restraints, the Byzantine icon made a lasting 
contribution to European art. Byzantium remained civilized, while most of the 
countries of the West were, in terms of formal culture, struggling in outer 
darkness. - 

The Rise of Islam, 622-778 

On 20 September 622 an obscure Arab mystic called Muhammad reached safety 
in the city of Medina. He had been driven from his native Mecca. He asked that 
a temple be built on the spot where his anxious disciples had greeted him. Thus, 
on Day One of Year One of the new religion, the first Muhammadan mosque 
was erected. 

For more than a decade, the former camel-driver had preached his radical 
ideas without success, having received a vision of his destiny from the archangel 
Gabriel in a cave on Mount Hira. 'Muhammad, in truth, in real truth, thou art 
Prophet of the Lord.' Later, after this first Night of Destiny, he had experienced 


another mystical vision, the Night Journey to Heaven. Riding on a magical steed, 
he was transported to Solomon's temple in Jerusalem, and thence through the 
spheres of the sky to the threshold of the Unseen Infinite. In 624 Muhammad 
armed 300 of his followers and routed an army sent to suppress them. In 628 he 
rode unopposed into Mecca on his favourite camel, at the head of 10,000 
faithful. He struck down the heathen idols in the shrine of the Kaaba, and 
transformed it into the holiest shrine of his own following. After four more years 
of teaching at Medina, where the main body of the Prophet's wisdom was 
recorded for the Holy Book, the Koran, he set out once more on the Farewell 
Pilgrimage to Mecca. In the Valley of Arafat he delivered his last message: 

Listen to my words, my people, for in the year to come I shall not be with you ... Hold your goods, your 
honour and your lives as sacred... until the day you return to God. Aid the poor and clothe them... 
Remember that one day you will appear before the Almighty and that He will ask you the reason for your 
actions ... It is true that you have certain rights with regard to your women, but they also have rights with 
regard to you. Treat them well, for they are your support... I have accomplished my mission, and I am 
leaving you a guide in the shape of the Lord's Book and the example of His Messenger... You will not fail 
if you follow this guide. 

As he fell to the ground, God spoke: 

This day have I perfected for you your religion, and completed my Favour unto 
you, and chosen for you as your religion-Islam.- 

Back in Medina, the Angel of Death entered the Prophet's chamber, and the 
Prophet said, 'Oh Death, execute your orders'. It was, according to the Christian 
calendar, 7 June 632. 

The desert land of Arabia forms a stepping-stone between the mainlands of 
Africa and Asia. It had always maintained a fierce independence from the 
surrounding empires. It faced Egypt and Abyssinia to the west, Mesopotamia 
and Persia to the north, and India to the east. Notwithstanding its arid wastes and 
bedouin tribes, it participated in all the great civilizations of the region. The 
Kaaba at Mecca marked the spot where Adam came after his expulsion from the 
Garden of Eden and where Abraham rebuilt the sacred shrine. Mecca itself was a 
wealthy staging-post on the caravan route joining the Mediterranean with East 
Africa and India. In the early seventh century it was in close contact with the 
Roman Empire in Egypt and with the rival Sassanid Empire of Persia. It was an 
unexpected source for a new world religion; but it had many advantages as a 
secure base for Islam's propagation. 


Islam, meaning 'submission 5 , was a universal religion from the start. 
Although it has always clung to Arabic as the sacred language of the Koran, it 
appeals to all nations, to all classes, and to both sexes. One of the most basic 
precepts is that all Muslims are brothers and sisters. In his lifetime Muhammad 
denounced the economic privileges of the ruling elite, the subordination of 
women, and the 'blood laws' of the Semitic tribes. His call for social, economic, 
and political equality threatened the foundations of traditional societies. His 
insistence on the rights of the oppressed and of women, and on the duty of 
charity and compassion, spelled liberation for the masses. Here was a 
revolutionary creed, whose almost instantaneous military power derived from 
the fervent devotion of the faithful. It enjoined that soldiers were the equal of 
their generals, subjects of their rulers, wives of their husbands. 'Better justice 
without religion than the tyranny of a devout ruler.' Like Christianity, it 
professed ideals which often outstripped the practices of its adherents; but the 
force and purity of those ideals is manifest. 'In the name of Allah, the all- 
Merciful, the Compassionate', it spread and spread, like wildfire through the 
deadwood of a wadi. 

Islam is said to rest on five pillars. The first, the confession of faith, consists 
of reciting the formula: 'La ilaha ilia Uah, Muhammadu 'rasulu llah' (There is 
no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his Messenger). Whoever says these words 
before witnesses becomes a Muslim. The second, ritual prayer requires the 
faithful to wash and to touch the ground with their heads turned towards Mecca 
at daybreak, noon, sunset, and evening. The third, called Zakat, involves giving 
alms to the poor. The fourth is fasting. Every sane and healthy Muslim adult 
must refrain from food, drink, and sexual intercourse from dawn to dusk 
throughout the month of Ramadan. The fifth, the Hadj obliges every Muslim to 
make the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in his or her lifetime. Above all, the 
loyal Muslim is enjoined to respect the teachings of the Koran, whose 114 suras 
or chapters provide a source of law, a manual of science and philosophy, a 
collection of myths and stories, and an ethical textbook. 

The caliphs, that is 'the successors' of the Prophet, quickly turned a united 
Arabia into the springboard for a theocratic world-empire. In their day they 
commanded unrivalled power, and wealth beyond tally, inspiring science, 
literature, and arts. Under Abu Bakr (r. 632-4), Omar (r. 634-44), and Othman 
(r. 644-56), their armies conquered Syria, Palestine, Persia, and Egypt in 
lightning succession. A fleet was constructed to protect Alexandria, and the 
Arabs soon became the leading sea-power of the Mediterranean. Under Ali (r. 



656-61), a cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet, civil and religious dissension 
broke out. But under the Omayyad dynasty unity was restored. Mo'awiya (r. 
661-80) established the capital in Damascus. Yazid I (r. 680-3) defeated Ali's 
rebellious son Hussein-the seminal event in the history of the Shi'ite sect. 
Abdulmalik (r. 685-705) suppressed an anti-Caliph in Mecca. Walid I (r. 705- 
15) saw the zenith of Omayyad power, before their long rivalry with the Abbasid 
dynasty ended in the bloodbath on the Zab in 750. Thereafter, under Al-Mansur 
('The Victorious', r. 754-75) the Abbasids launched a 500-year reign. For a 
time, their capital in Baghdad was the centre of the world. 

The transfer of Jerusalem from Christian to Muslim hands was an event of 
immense consequence. The city was, and is, sacred to all three monotheistic 
religions. But in the centuries since the Roman expulsion of the Jews, the 
Christians had guarded the Holy Places for themselves: 

On a February day in the year AD 638, the Caliph Omar entered Jerusalem riding on a white camel. He was 
dressed in worn, filthy robes, and the army that followed him was rough and unkempt; but its discipline was 
perfect. At his side rode the Patriarch Sophronius as chief magistrate of the surrendered city. Omar rode 
straight to the site of the Temple of Solomon, whence his friend Mahomet had ascended into Heaven. 
Watching him stand there, the Patriarch remembered the words of Christ and murmured through his tears: 
'Behold the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet.'- 

Henceforth the Holy City was to be held by Islamic authorities. The Patriarch 
became a hostage to fortune. Christian pilgrims could not easily reach their goal, 
and chose increasingly to visit Rome instead. Christianity's centre of gravity 
shifted dramatically westwards. 

In that century following the Prophet's death, the armies of Islam marched 
on relentlessly. Byzantium was unsuccessfully besieged on two occasions, in 
673-8 and 717-18. But Kabul, Bokhara, and Samarkand were captured in the 
East, Carthage and Tangier in the west. In 711 the crossing of the Pillars of 
Hercules by Al-Tariq-henceforth called Jebel al-Tariq, or Gibraltar-brought 
the Muslims into Europe, overwhelming Visigothic Spain and breaching the 
Pyrenees. In 732, on the centenary of Muhammad's death, they reached Tours on 
the Loire, a few days' ride from Paris, in the heart of the Frankish kingdom. 

As a result of these far-flung conquests, autonomous Islamic states, paying 
no more than nominal service to the distant Caliphs, emerged in Spain, in 
Morocco, in Tunisia, in Egypt, in Persia, and in Transoxania. Islam progressed as 
far in one century as Christianity in seven. In Iberia the Muslim conquerors 
remembered their history and called the country El-Andalus, the 'Land of the 


Vandals', creating many new principalities. The emirate of Cordova, founded 
shortly after Al-Tariq's arrival, established the most durable Muslim presence on 
the European continent. Together with its successors, the Almoravid empire and 
the emirate of Granada, it was to last for nearly eight centuries. At its height 
under Abd al-Rahman (r. 912-61), it covered the greater part of the Iberian 
peninsula, and claimed the caliphate of all Islam. It brought civilization of the 
highest order, and a major demographic influx of Arabs, Moors, Berbers, and 
Jews. There were repeated injections of North Africans into Spain from the 
eighth to the twelfth centuries, [mezquita] 

From that point on, Islam has had a permanent presence in Europe. First in 
the south-west, in Iberia, and later in the south-east, in the Balkan and Black Sea 
regions (see Chapter VII). The interaction of Christians and Muslims has 
provided one of the most enduring features of Europe's political and cultural life. 
From the eighth century onwards there has never been a day when the adhan, the 
call of the muezzin, could not be heard morning and evening, summoning the 
faithful to prayer: 








Allahu akbar 

ashadu 'an la ilaha ilia llah 

ashadu anna Muhammadu 'rasulu 'llah 

'ala ' 1-salah 

hayya 'ala' 1-falah 

Allahu akbar 

ashadu 'an la ilAha ilia llah 

(God is most great | I testify that there is no god but God | I testify that 
Muhammad is the prophet of God | To prayer, | Come on, to salvation! | God is 
most great 11 testify that there is no god but God.)- 

At the dawn call, an extra summons is inserted after the fourth formula, al- 
salat khair min al-nawm, 'Prayer is better than sleep'. All Muslims who hear the 
call must repeat its words, except after the fourth and fifth formulas, when they 
recite: 'There is no power nor strength but in Allah', and 'Thou hast spoken 
truthfully and righteously'. Every adult and healthy Muslim is obliged to 
perform the Salat, or 'ritual prostrations', five times each day. 

Meanwhile, with the Arabs on the Loire, the Franks steeled themselves to 
repel the Muslim advance. Charles Martel (c.688-741), mayor of the 
Merovingian palace, gathered an army which stemmed the tide. The Battle of 
Poitiers in 732 may well have been exaggerated by Christian apologists: the 
Arabs may have been obliged to retreat through over-extended lines of 
communication. They were, after all, more than 1,000 miles out from Gibraltar. 
But it inspired some magnificent passages: 

The repetition of an equal space would have carried the Saracens to the confines of Poland and the 
highlands of Scotland; the Rhine is not more impassable than the Nile or the Euphrates, and the Arabian 
fleet might have sailed without a naval combat into the mouth of the Thames. Perhaps the interpretation of 
the Koran would now be taught in the schools of Oxford, and her pulpits might demonstrate to a 
circumcised people the sanctity and truth of the revelation of Mohammed.- 

Thenceforth, in the West, the Muslims were to be held on the line of the 
Pyrenees. Muslims and Franks were to contest the mountain passes for 
generations. One such encounter at the Pass of Roncevaux gave rise to the most 
famous of medieval legends, as celebrated in the chansons de geste. Two 
Frankish knights, variously known as Roland and Oliver or Orlando and 
Rinaldo, are hard-pressed by the Muslim army as they try to withdraw their 
forces to safety on the northern side. Oliver urges his companion to sound the 


signal horn to bring up reinforcements. Roland, more valiant than wise, fails to 
comply until the battle is already lost. When he finally blows the horn, bursting 
the veins in his head, it is heard all over Francia. Roland, swooning on his horse, 
is struck by mistake in the melee by the blinded Oliver: 

'Sir cumpain, faites le vos de gred? 

Ja est co Rollant, ki tant vos soelt amer! 

Par nule guise ne m'aviez desfiet!' 

Dist Oliver: 'Or vos oi jo parler. 

Je ne vos vei, veied vus Damnedeu! 

Ferut vos ai, car le me pardunez!' 

Rollant respunt: 'Jo n'ai nient de mel. 

Jol vos pardains ici e devant Deu.' 

Aicel mot Fun a Faltre ad clinet. 

Par tel amur as les vus desevred. 

('Companion, Sir, did you intend this stroke? | For I am Roland who loves you 
so dear, | And you have not defied or challenged me.' | Oliver said: 'Now I can 
hear you speak | But see you not; God keep you in his sight! 11 have struck you? 
Forgive me then I beg!' | Roland replies: 'I have come to no harm. | You have my 
pardon here and before God? | At this, each bows towards the other's breast. | 
See with what love they to their parting come!)- 

'Alas, sweet Francia, today you will be shorn of your good vassals.' 

In the East, the Christian line was held by the Byzantine forces. But the 
Muslim presence was felt deep into the Slavonic hinterland. The Muslim world 
had a growing appetite for slaves, and raw-boned Slavs were a favourite 
commodity. Jewish traders and Vikings acted as the middlemen and the carriers, 
especially through Crimea [khazaria] [rus',] but later in the Baltic and Central 
Europe [dirham]. Such was the association of Slavs with the slave-trade that the 
two words 'Slav' and 'slave' have widely been thought to be synonymous. The 
Arabic word for eunuch, sakaliba, is also considered to derive from 'Slav'. It is 
no accident that the first surviving eyewitness report of the Slavonic lands was 
written by a Moorish Jew, a merchant from Tortosa (see p. 454). 


MEZQUITA 





No building in Europe better illustrates the cycle of civilizations than the 
Mezquita Aljama, now the cathedral church in Cordoba. Its oldest part dates 
from the reign of Abd-al-Rahman I (r. 755-88). As a treasure-house of 
Hispano-lslamic art, it ranks with the Alcazar in Seville or the fabled palace 
of Alhambra at Granada. But its originality lies in the use of materials taken 
from the demolished Latin-Byzantine Basilica of St Vincent which stood 
until 741 on the same site, and which had once been shared by Christian and 
Moslem congregations. What is more, both mosque and basilica rested on 
the foundations of a great Roman temple, which in its turn had replaced a 
Greek or possibly a Phoenician edifice. Only St Sofia in Istanbul can match 
such varied connections. 

The proportions of the Mezquita befit a city which outgrew medieval 
Rome many times over. Together with its central Orange-Tree Courtyard, it 
covers an area of 130 m. x 180 m., surrounded by walls and decorated 
battlements. Most impressive, however, are the many features which 
combine Islamic and Christian elements. The great nave is filled with a 
forest of multicoloured marble columns supporting two layers of arches. The 
columns, topped by variegated capitals, came from the old basilica. The 
lower, 'horseshoe' arches are made from alternating segments of white 
limestone and red brick. The upper layer of round arches is pure Roman. The 
main northern door is covered with metal plates at the centre of which the 
word deus alternates with ai-muik liiah ('The empire and power are God's 
alone'). The exquisite Dove's Door has an ornate Arabian arch embellished 
by a medieval ogive surround. The miharab or 'niche of orientation', 
indicating the direction of Mecca, was built by Syrian architects, who duly 
pointed it to the south. It takes the form of a small octagonal room under a 
single conchshell ceiling. It is entered by an archway in polychrome mosaic 
and preceded by a vestibule under three Byzantine cupolas. Persian-style 
cufie inscriptions abound, even in sections such as the Royal Chapel, which 
was refurbished with gothic ornament and feudal heraldry in the fourteenth 
century. Christian Baroque inspired the altar and entablature within the 
mosque, and the Chapel of the Incas. 1 

A few sites in Spain, like the Mezquita of Cordoba or the old city of 
Toledo, do convey a strong sense of continuity. Modern tourists love to be 
told that Muslim Spain introduced Europeans to oranges, lemons, spinach, 
asparagus, aubergines, artichokes, pasta, and toothpaste, together with 



mathematics, Greek philosophy, and paper, [xativah] 

But the fact is that the continuities are few. Muslim civilization in Spain 
was not just superseded; wherever possible it was eradicated (see p. 345). 
Visitors might get a truer sense of history if they visit the lonely Muslim 
castle of Trujillo in Extremadura or the deserted walled city of Vascos in 
Castille. In Cordoba, one should proceed from the Mezquita to the palace of 
Madinat al-Zahra (Medina Azahara) outside the city. It was once the 
residence of a caliph who could contact Egypt within twenty-four hours 
along a network of sun-mirror stations, and who required foreign 
ambassadors to approach his throne-room under a canopy three miles long 
and supported by a double row of his Berber soldiers. It once housed a 
population of 20,000 including a harem of 6,000. Damaged by the Berber 
revolt in 1010, its ruins were not rediscovered by archaeologists until 1911. 2 

When Spaniards shout 'Ole', many do not care to remember that they are 
voicing an invocation to Allah. 


Islam's impact on the Christian world cannot be exaggerated. Islam's conquests 
turned Europe into Christianity's main base. At the same time the great swathe 
of Muslim territory cut the Christians off from virtually all direct contact with 
other religions and civilizations. The barrier of militant Islam turned the 
Peninsula in on itself, severing or transforming many of the earlier lines of 
commercial, intellectual, and political intercourse. In the field of religious 
conflict, it left Christendom with two tasks-to fight Islam and to convert the 
remaining pagans. It forced the Byzantine Empire to give lasting priority to the 
defence of its Eastern borders, and hence to neglect its imperial mission in the 
West. It created the conditions where the other, more distant Christian states had 
to fend for themselves, and increasingly to adopt measures for local autonomy 
and economic self-sufficiency. In other words, it gave a major stimulus to 
feudalism. Above all, by commandeering the Mediterranean Sea, it destroyed the 
supremacy which the Mediterranean lands had hitherto exercised over the rest of 
the Peninsula. Before Islam, the post-classical world of Greece and Rome, as 
transmuted by Christianity, had remained essentially intact. After Islam, it was 
gone forever. Almost by default, the political initiative passed from the 
Mediterranean to the emerging kingdoms of the north, especially to the most 
powerful of those kingdoms in Trancia'. 




In the course of that eighth century, therefore, when Europe's Christians were 
digesting the implications of the Islamic conquests, the seeds of a new order 
were sown. The Bishop of Rome, deprived of support from Byzantium, was 
forced to turn to the Franks, and to embark on the enterprise of the 'Papacy'. The 
Franks saw their chance to back the Pope. Indirectly, Charlemagne was the 
product of Muhammad (see below, pp. 284-90). According to Henri Pirenne, 
whose thesis shattered earlier conceptions as surely as Islam shattered the 
ancient world, 'The Frankish Empire would probably never have existed without 
Islam, and Charlemagne without Mahomet would be inconceivable.'- The 
arguments of Pirenne have been diminished on detailed points, especially 
regarding the alleged break in commercial relations. But they revolutionized the 
study of the transition from the ancient to the medieval worlds. 

To talk of Muhammad and Charlemagne, however, is not enough. Islam 
affected Eastern Europe even more directly than it affected Western Europe. Its 
appearance set the bounds of a new, compact entity called 'Christendom', of 
which Constantinople would be the strongest centre for some time to come. It set 
a challenge to the pagans on the eastern fringes of Christian-Muslim rivalry, who 
henceforth faced the prospect of choosing between the two dominant religions. 
Above all, it created the cultural bulwark against which European identity could 
be defined. Europe, let alone Charlemagne, is inconceivable without 
Muhammad. 

Christianity's rivalry with Islam raised moral and psychological problems no 
less profound than those already existing between Christianity and Judaism. 
Both Christians and Muslims were taught to regard the other as the infidel. Their 
misunderstandings, antagonisms and negative stereotypes were endless. It was 
never popular, least of all among the clergy, to stress how much the three great 
monotheistic religions held in common. As a result, a strong dichotomy 
developed between the Christian 'West' and the Islamic 'East'. Medieval 
Europeans commonly referred to Muslims as 'Saracens', an epithet derived from 
the Arabic word sharakyoun or 'easterner'. Among those Westerners who have 
imagined themselves to be the bearers of a superior civilization, there has been a 
long tradition of viewing the Muslim East with mindless disdain. 


The Christian Church in the Age of the General 
Councils, 325-787 


By the time of the first General Council at Nicaea in 325 (see p. 205), the 
Christian Church headed the largest religious community in the Empire. Since 
the Edict of Milan, it benefited from the policy of toleration; and it had the 
support of the reigning emperor. But its position was not entirely secure. It was 
not the established state religion, and it had many enemies in high places. It had 
made few inroads beyond the Empire. Progress, from the Christian point of view, 
and particularly from that of the 'Orthodox' party led by Athanasius, was going 
to be bumpy, [ikon] 

Under Constantius II (r. 337-61) there was a brief resurgence of Arianism. 
Not for the last time, Athanasius was banished. In 340, when the Goths were still 
resident to the north of the Danube delta, they were converted to Christianity in 
its Arian form. As a result, when the Ostrogoths and the Visigoths entered the 
Empire and established their kingdoms in Italy, Gaul, Spain, and Africa, they 
took their Arianism with them. They presented a major obstacle to the spread of 
Orthodox Christianity among the barbarians, [biblia] Another change of tack 
came with the Emperor Julian (r. 361-3), a philosopher-monarch known in the 
Christian tradition as 'the Apostate'. Educated in the Christian faith by people 
who had murdered his family, 'he had always declared himself an advocate of 
Paganism'. The end result was an edict of general toleration, and a last interval 
of respite for the Roman gods. 'The only hardship which he inflicted on the 
Christians was to deprive them of the power of tormenting their fellow subjects.' 
There is no evidence for the legend that his last words were Vicisti Galilaee, 
'Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean'.- 

These experiences shook the Trinitarian party from their complacency. 
Athanasius in the East and Hilary of Poitiers (315-67) in the West, who had led 
the opposition to Constantius and Julian, were succeeded by the generation of 
the Church's most brilliant and commanding Fathers. John Chrysostom (347- 
407), the 'Golden Mouth', Bishop of Constantinople, was the greatest preacher 
of the age, who ruffled many feathers in high society. Basil the Great (330-79), 
Bishop of Caesarea, came from a remarkable family that claimed no fewer than 
eight saints. He is generally accounted the founder of communal monasticism. 
His brother, Gregory of Nyssa (335-95), and his friend, Gregory of Nazianus 
(329-89), were both prominent theologians, who carried the day at the Second 
General Council at Constantinople (381). In the West, the Pannonian Martin of 
Tours (315-97) completed the evangelization of Gaul. Ambrose of Milan 
(c.334-97) was the leading ecclesiastical politician of the age. The Dalmatian 
Jerome (c.345-420) was the leading biblical scholar of the early church. The 


African, Augustine of Hippo, was probably the most influential of the Church 
Fathers. 

Their efforts bore fruit in the reign of Theodosius (r. 378-95), who was the 
last emperor to rule both East and West and who gave his support to the 
Trinitarian party. Theodosius was a Spaniard, son of a general, and a man of 
ferocious temper. He turned to the Trinitarians for the simple reason that his 
predecessor, Valens, had been killed by the Arian Goths. Under his protection 
the Second General Council ratified the Nicene Creed. Trinitarian Christianity 
was supported with the force of law; Arianism was banned; paganism was 
persecuted. This is the point where the Trinitarians could start to enforce their 
claim to orthodoxy, and to condemn their rivals past and present as 'heretics', 
[index] [rufinus] [zeus] 

To many believers in subsequent centuries, this Triumph of Christianity' was 
celebrated as a wonderful achievement. Theodosius was awarded the epithet of 
'Great'. But there was little in the teaching of Christ to recommend such a close 
association of spiritual and political authority. Moreover, Theodosius was hardly 
an example of Christlike virtue. In 388 he killed his co-emperor, Magnus 
Maximus; and in 390 he wreaked terrible revenge on the city of Thessalonika for 
daring to permit a rebellious riot. He ordered his officers to invite the whole 
population to the Circus, as if to the Games, and then to slaughter all 7,000 in 
cold blood. For this crime he was constrained by Ambrose to perform public 
penance, and he died in Milan, somewhat better apprised of the religion to which 
he had given such signal services. 

Theologian and bishop, St Augustine (354-430) had trained as a rhetorician, 
and had once been an advocate of Manichaeanism. He was converted to 
Christianity in Milan in 386. His willingness to admit to human weaknesses 
makes him the most appealing writer. His Confessions, which recount the 
emotions of a young man called to renounce the comforts and pleasures of the 
worldly life, stand in stark contrast to the polemicist disputing with Donatists, 
Manichaeans, and Pelagians. Yet he analysed and systematized the intricacies of 
those doctrines with such mastery that he left little to be done until Thomas 
Aquinas almost 800 years later. He stressed the primacy of love in a way that 
almost recommends libertinism. Dilige et quod vis fag (Love and do what you 
want) and Cum dilectione hominum et odio vitiorum (Love the sinner and hate 
the sins) were two of his maxims. At the same time, he stressed the necessity of 
the institutionalized Church. Salus extra ecclesiam non est (there is no salvation 



outside the Church), he wrote; also Roma locuta est; causa finita. (Rome has 
spoken; the case is closed.) The most popular of his 113 books, De Civitate Dei 
(The City of God), was inspired by Alaric's sack of Rome, and describes a 
spiritual city built on the ruins of the material world. Nothing could be more 
expressive of the age. Augustine spent over thirty years as Bishop of Hippo in 
his native Africa, living by an ascetic rule that later inspired a number of Church 
orders including the Augustinian Canons, the Dominican (Black) Friars, the 
Praemonstratensians, and the Brigittines. He died in Hippo besieged by the 
Vandals. 


INDEX 

Early Church tradition credited Pope Innocent I (r. 401-17) with the first 
list of forbidden books, and Pope Gelasius (r. 492-6) with the first decree on 
the subject. The Gelasian decree adds lists of recommended and of 
supplementary reading to its pronouncement on the canon of authentic 
Scripture. Modern scholarship, though, doubts that the decree had any 
connection with Gelasius. What is certain is that the Church always guarded 
its right to pronounce on the propriety, or impropriety, of the written word. 
From the fifth to the fifteenth centuries, it placed any number of bans on 
individual authors, from Arius and Photius to Hus and Pico della Mirandola 
(1486). A further step was prompted by the advent of printing. Though there 
is some dispute again about precedence, Pope Innocent VIII (r. 1484-92) 
either initiated or consolidated the rule that all publications should receive a 
bishop's licence, [press] 

Thanks to the flood of books produced during the Renaissance and 
Reformation, the Church hierarchy increasingly sought guidance from the 
Vatican; and the Council of Trent demanded action. The result was the Index 
Librorum Prohibitorum or 'Guide to Prohibited Books' drawn up by Paul IV 
in 1557. Owing to dissensions in the Vatican, that first version was 
suppressed; and it was the second version of 1559 which was eventually 
published. Revised yet again at the request of the Council, the Tridentine 
Index of 1564 set the norm for subsequent practice. In addition to the list of 
authors and works which had earned the Church's disapproval, it set out ten 




criteria for judging them. Since 1564 Rome's 'Blacklist' has been constantly 
extended. Its rules were modified in 1596,1664,1758,1900, and 1948. (See 
Appendix III, p. 1274.) 

Over the years the Index has been subject to much criticism. It was 
always ineffective, in that the prohibited titles could always find a publisher 
in Protestant states beyond the Vatican's reach. What is more, since 
forbidden fruits always taste sweeter, the Index could seriously be charged 
with actively promoting what it sought to suppress. Enemies of the Church 
were always quick to cite it as proof of Catholic intolerance. From the 
Enlightenment, liberated intellectuals have never failed to pour ridicule both 
on the individual decisions of the Index and on its very existence. Given the 
tally of world-beaters and best-sellers which it has tried to oppose, one can 
see the reason why. 

On the other hand, the Index has to be judged in context. Every authority 
in modern Europe, whether secular or ecclesiastical, Protestant, Catholic, or 
Orthodox, has shared the Vatican's desire to control publications. Censors 
were at work in all European countries until the second half of the twentieth 
century. Many of those vociferous in condemning the Papal Index have 
failed to see a contradiction when they themselves seek to suppress books. 
One has only to look at some of the times and places in which the classics of 
European literature have been banned by authorities other than the Vatican:

Of course, there is a fundamental liberal position which holds that all 
publications should be permitted, even when material is manifestly 
blasphemous, subversive, incitatory, obscene, or untrue. It demands that 



people tolerate what they abhor. This position was tested in the 1980s by so- 
called 'revisionist history', which denies the reality of the Jewish Holocaust, 
or by the Islamic fatxvah pronounced on Salman Rushdie's Satanic Verses. In 
practice, many liberals shrink from the application of their own absolute 
principles. Every society, and every generation, has to determine its stance in 
relation to the shifting line between the acceptable and the unacceptable. 2 
Nor is it appropriate to compare the Papal Index with contemporary 
totalitarian censorship. In Nazi Germany 1933-45, and in the Soviet world 
1917-91, all works were officially considered banned until specifically 
approved. In this regard, the principle of episcopal licensing might be judged 
more repressive than the Index. 

In 1966 the head of the Vatican's Congregation of the Doctrine of the 
Faith announced that the prohibition of publications had been suspended. By 
that time, the Index contained some 4,000 titles. 

Much of the above information derives from an impeccable source, each of 
whose eighteen volumes bears evidence of a favourable episcopal decision 
-nihil obstat (There is no impediment) and imprimatur (Let it be 
printed). 3 


RUFINUS 

Rufinus Tyrannius of Aquileia (c.340-410), sometime associate of St 
Jerome, made his name on two related scores-as the Latin translator of 
Greek theological works, especially by Origen, and as author of the earliest 
book printed by the Oxford University Press. His commentary on the 
Apostles' Creed, the Expositio Sancti Hieronymi in symbolum apostolo-rum, 
was printed in Oxford by Theodoric Rood of Cologne, and completed on 17 
December 1478. It began, alas, with a misprint, an 'x' having been lost on 
the frontispiece, where the publication date appeared (wrongly) as M CCCC 
LXVIII. 1

Reputedly, OUP's most remarkable feat was in 1914, when a team of 
Oxford historians went into print in support of Britain's war effort. The 
manuscript of Why We Are at War was delivered on 26 August, barely three 
weeks after the outbreak of war. The 206-page volume was edited, typeset 
by hand, printed, bound and ready for distribution by 14 September. Times 
change. 2 


Disturbances in the heart of the Empire inevitably weakened links with the 
periphery. In the fifth century, important peculiarities developed on the one hand 
in the 'Celtic fringe', and on the other hand in the Caucasus. The Celtic Church 
had adopted Christianity from Gaulish, anchorite monks. Its bishops were 
peripatetic hermits, and through the practice of single-handed consecration, 




extremely numerous. Ireland, which had never formed part of the Empire, was 
systematically evangelized by St Patrick (c.389-461), a Roman citizen from 
western Britain who landed in Ulster in 432. In this way Ireland had been 
secured for Christianity before the blanket of Anglo-Saxon heathenism fell over 
the rest of the British Isles. The Irish would repay their debt, [brito] 


ZEUS 

The statue of Zeus was transported to Constantinople from the shrine at 
Olympia following the last Olympiad in ad 396. By then it was over eight 
centuries old, and had been long established as one of the 'wonders of the 
world'. Completed c.432 bc by the exiled Athenian Pheidias, whose statue 
of Athena graced the Parthenon, it consisted of a gigantic ivory figure, 
wreathed and enthroned, some 13 metres high. Plated in part with solid gold, 
it portrayed the Father of the Gods holding a statuette of Winged Victory in 
his right hand and an inlaid, eagle-topped sceptre in his left. It had been 
described in detail both by Pausanias and by Strabo, who said that if the God 
moved, his head would go through the roof. Suetonius reports that when the 
Emperor Caligula's workmen had tried to remove it in the first century ad, 
'the God cackled so loudly' that the scaffolding collapsed and the workmen 
fled. So it stayed in situ for three more centuries. When it was finally 
consumed by the flames of an accidental fire in 462, in the capital of the 
Christian Emperor, Leo I, Olympia was already deserted. In 1958 German 
archaeologists excavating the temple workshops at Olympia found a 
terracotta cup inscribed with the graffito 'I BELONGED TO PHEIDIAS'. 1 


BRITO 

Pelagius (c.360-420) was a Welshman, or at least a Celt from the British 
Isles ('Pelagius' was once thought to be a Graeco-Roman caique of his 






name, Morgan). His friends called him 'Brito'. He was a Christian 
theologian, and one of the few from Western Europe who participated in the 
leading doctrinal debates of his day. He lived at a time when orthodox 
doctrine, as formulated by the Greeks, was beginning to crystallize. Though 
his views were deemed heretical, he was none the less a vital contributor. He 
was a contemporary of St Augustine of Hippo, whom he provoked into 
formulating what became the definitive statements on such central issues as 
Divine Grace, The Fall of Man, Original Sin, Free Will, and Predestination. 
Together with another Briton, Celestius, whom he met in Rome, he laid 
emphasis on man's capacity for virtuous action through the exercise of will, 
in other words, on responsible conduct. His central concept, known as 'the 
power of contrary choice', is contained in the formula Si necessitatis est, 
peccatum non est; si voluntatis, vitiari potest (If there be need, there is no 
sin; but if the will is there, then sinning is possible). He also held that the 
first step towards salvation must be made by an act of will. 

These views were rejected partly because they were thought to minimize 
God's grace and partly because they attributed sin to individual failings 
rather than to human nature. The label of Pelagianism is generally attached 
to theological standpoints which deny or limit Original Sin. They figured 
strongly in the seventeenth-century debates surrounding Arminius and 
Jansen. (See pp. 492, 502.) 

In 410, having fled the Gothic siege of Rome, Pelagius and Celestius 
took refuge in North Africa, where further doctrinal charges were laid 
against them. One of the Councils of Carthage condemned six cardinal 
errors: 

That Adam would have died even if he had not sinned. 

That Adam injured himself alone, not the human race. 

That new-born children, like Adam at birth, are without sin. 

That the human race does not die through Adam's death or sin. 

That the law, as well as the gospel, gives entrance to Heaven. 

That there were men without sin even before Christ's coming. 

Pelagius sailed for Palestine, only to find that Augustine's De peccato- 
rum mentis (On the Merits of Sinners) had singled him out for attack. He 
survived one inquisition; but he was lost when the sympathies of Pope 
Zosimus were won over by the African bishops. In an edict of 30 April 418 



the Emperor Honorius condemned him to confiscation and banishment. The 
Venerable Bede showed no sympathy for his 'noxious and abominable 
teaching 5 : 

Against the great Augustine see him crawl, 

This wretched scribbler with his pen of gall! 1 

A movement to reconcile Pelagius with Augustine developed round the 
works of Bishop Honoratus of Aries (c.350-429). It held that Divine Grace 
and Human Will are coefficient factors in salvation. This 'semi-PelagianisnT 
was condemned at the Council of Orange (529). But its home, at the 
monastery of St Honorat on the Isle de Lerins off the Cote d'Azur, did not 
close. St Vincent of Lerins (d. 450) invented the famous 'Vincentian Canon' 
whereby all theological propositions can be tested against the threefold 
criteria of ecumenicity, antiquity, and consent. The monks of Lerins 
published the definitive edition of St Hilary's Life of Honoratus in 1977. 2 


The Armenian Church came into being when the province still belonged to 
the Empire. Like its Celtic counterpart, it lost all direct contact with the centre 
and became eccentric in all senses of the word. When the Celts were turning to 
Pelagianism, the Armenians were turning to Monophysitism. Christianity had 
reached Georgia in 330, when the ruling house was converted by a Cappadocian 
slave-girl. Being one step removed from Armenia, it was less exposed to Asian 
politics and maintained closer links with Constantinople. (The Georgian Church 
had a separate and continuous history until forcibly incorporated into Russian 
Orthodoxy in 1811.) In 431 a third General Council was held at Ephesus, thereby 
creating a series. The seven General Councils recognized as binding by both 
East and West were Nicaea I (325), Constantinople I (381), Ephesus (431), 
Chalcedon (451), Constantinople II (553), Constantinople HI (680-1), Nicaea II 
(787). The Council of Ephesus condemned the Nestorian heresy. Gibbon called it 
an 'ecclesiastical riot'. Like its predecessors and successors, it was convened by 
the Emperor in Constantinople, who claimed the highest authority in Church 
affairs. It was entirely dominated by bishops from the East. The bishops in the 
West accepted the decisions, but with growing reluctance. 

Doctrinal divergences persisted over the seemingly incurable habit of 
christological hairsplitting: over Christ's nature, over Christ's will, over Christ's 




role in the genesis of the Holy Ghost. Does Christ have one single nature, that is, 
divine, or a dual nature both human and divine? The Orthodox leaders supported 
Diophysitism, and in the Definition of Chalcedon (451) affirmed the formula of 
One Person in Two Natures, 'unconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, and 
inseparably' united. The Monophysites were condemned; but they continued to 
flourish in the East. The empress Theodora was a Monophysite, and so were the 
majority of Christians in Armenia, Syria, and Egypt. Does Christ have one will 
or two? Pope Honorius carelessly used the phrase 'one will' in a letter to 
Constantinople in 634. But the Orthodox leaders supported Diothelitism, which 
they affirmed at the sixth General Council in 681. The Monothelites were 
condemned, and the delegates of Pope Agatho acquiesced in the Council's 
ruling. Within the Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, does the Holy Ghost 
proceed from the Father, as the sole fount of divinity, and hence through the Son, 
or does it proceed jointly, from Father and Son together? Constantinople held to 
per filium (through the Son); Rome held to filioque (and the Son). The matter 
first surfaced in 589 in Spain, and by the ninth century was causing major 
ruptures. It has never been resolved. 

The attraction of monasticism grew in proportion to political and social 
disorder. Eastern practices, both anchorite and communal, spread to the West. 
The earliest communal monasteries preceded the fall of the Western Empire. St 
Martin founded Liguge in 360. But the greatest influence was that of Benedict of 
Nursia (c.480-550), who formulated the most widely adopted of all monastic 
rules. As imperial authority shrank, especially in the former Western provinces, 
the monasteries increasingly served as oases of classical learning in the 
barbarian desert. The conjunction of Christian teaching with an appreciation of 
Greek philosophy and the Latin authors had long been accepted in the East, 
especially in Alexandria; but in the West it had to be cultivated. The central 
figure in this regard was Flavius Magnus Aurelius Senator (c.485-580), known 
as Cassiodorus, sometime governor of Italy under Theodoric the Ostrogoth. 
Retiring to a monastery after the arrival of Belisarius, he advocated a system of 
education where sacred and profane subjects were seen as complementary; and 
he started the collection of ancient documents. It was none too soon, [anno

In the seventh century the shock of Islam changed the contours of the 
Christian world for ever. It ended the cultural unity of the Mediterranean lands 
and broke the dominance which they had always exercised over the northern 
outposts. By overrunning Persia, Syria, and Egypt, it determined that three of the 



five recognized Patriarchs-in Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria-would be 
forced to operate in partibus infidelium. The politics of the Christian Church was 
reduced from a healthy five-sided arena to a bitter two-sided contest between the 
Greek Patriarch in Constantinople and the Latin Patriarch in Rome. Before 
Islam, the Patriarch of Rome spoke with one Latin voice against four Greeks; 
after Islam, it was one to one. And the Roman Church enjoyed a greater margin 
for manoeuvre. Moreover, the threatening quarrel with the Monophysites in the 
East was not resolved. The new Muslim rulers proved more tolerant of heresy 
than Orthodox Christians had been. So the Monophysite Armenian, Syrian, and 
Coptic Churches were never recalled to the fold. 

Most importantly, perhaps, Islam cut Christianity off from the rest of the 
world. Before Islam, the Christian Gospels had reached both Ceylon and 
Abyssinia; after Islam, they were effectively excluded for centuries from further 
expansion into Asia or Africa. Most Christians never saw a Muslim during their 
lifetime; but all of them lived in Islam's shade. Islam, in fact, provided the solid, 
external shield within which Christendom could consolidate and be defined. In 
this sense, it provided the single greatest stimulus to what was eventually called 
'Europe'. 


ANNO DOMINI 

For six centuries after the birth of Christ, very few people were conscious 
of living in 'the Christian Era'. Indeed, the basic chronology of history since 
'Christ walked in Galilee' was not established before the work of Dionysius 
Exiguus, a Greek-speaking monk from Scythia Minor and friend of 
Cassiodorus who died in Rome c.550. It was the idea of Dionysius that the 
counting of years should be based on Christ's Incarnation and that it should 
begin on the Day of the Annunciation, when the Virgin Mary had conceived. 
He fixed this date, Day One of Year One, at 25 March, nine months before 
the birth of Christ on 25 December. All previous years, counted in receding 
order, were to be designated ante Christum (AC), or 'Before Christ' (BC). 
All subsequent years were to be 'Years since the Incarnation', or Anni 
Domini, 'Years of Our Lord' (ad). There was no Zero Year. 1 

Many more centuries elapsed before the Christian Era, or Common Era, 




gradually came into use, first in the Latin Church, later in the East. The 
Venerable Bede (673-735), who was the author of a book on chronology, De 
Temporibus, had fully accepted the new system when he wrote his History of 
the English Church and People in the early eighth century. 

In the mean time, all sorts of local chronologies prevailed. The most 
usual system was that of regnal years. Historical time was measured by 
reigns and generations. Dates were determined by their point in the reign of 
a particular emperor, pope, or prince. The model was in the Old Testament: 
'And it came to pass in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the 
seventh year of Hoshea, son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of 
Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged it.. 

The Christian Era had to compete with numerous rival chronological 
systems. The table of Greek Olympiads, the four-year cycles between 
Olympic Games, which began with the Olympiad of Coroebus on 1 July 776 
BC, was continued until the end of the fourth century ad. The Babylonian 
Era of Nabonassar, which was used by the Greeks of Alexandria, was known 
in medieval times from the works of Ptolemy. Its starting-point was 
equivalent to Wednesday, 26 February 747 BC. The Macedonian Era of the 
Seleucids, which began with occupation of Babylon by Seleucus Nicator in 
312 BC, was widely used in the Levant. Known to the Jews as 'the era of 
contracts', it was used by them until the fifteenth century. The Roman Era 
was based on the passage of years since 'the Foundation of the City' [auc.] 
In Spain, the Era of the Caesars can be traced to the conquest of Iberia by 
Octavian in 39 BC. Adopted by the Visigoths, it remained in force in 
Catalonia till 1180, in Castile until 1382, in Portugal until 1415. The Muslim 
Era of Hegira, which marks the flight of the Prophet from Mecca, 
corresponds to Friday, 16 July ad 622. It remains in force throughout the 
Muslim world. 

Not surprisingly, given the complications, the calculation of the birth of 
Christ by Dionysius Exiguus has since turned out to be faulty. Dionysius 
equated Year One with Olympic Era 195 (1), with 754 auc, and, mistakenly, 
with 'the Consulship of C. Caesar, son of Augustus, and L. Aemilius 
Paullus, son of Paullus'. In reality, there is nothing to show that Christ was 
actually born in ad 1. According to whether one follows St Luke or St 
Matthew, the Christian Era began either in the last year of Herod the Great (4 
bc) or in the year of the first Roman census in Judaea (ad 6-7). 



For Christians as for Jews, the prime historical date was the Year of 
Creation, or Annus Mundi. The Byzantine Church fixed it at 5509 BC, which 
remained the basis of the ecclesiastical calendar in parts of the Orthodox 
world, in Greece and in Russia, until modern times. Jewish scholars 
preferred 3760 BC-the starting-point of the modern Jewish calendar. The 
Coptic Church, like the Alexandrians, fixed on 5500 BC. The Church of 
England, under Archbishop Ussher in 1650, picked 4004 BC. 

The critical comparison and harmonization of oriental, classical, and 
Christian chronologies awaited the great Renaissance scholar Joseph 
Scaliger (1540-1609). Scaliger's De Emendatione Temporum (The Reform 
of Dates, 1583), written with Protestant interests in mind, coincided with the 
reform of the Julian calendar by Pope Gregory XIII. It marks the beginning 
of chronological science, and of modern concerns about the standard 
measurement of historical time. 2 

The Gregorian Calendar, however, known as 'New Style' (NS) and 
introduced into the Catholic countries of Europe in 1585, was not universally 
accepted. Most Protestant or Orthodox countries stayed with the Julian 'Old 
Style'. They adopted the New Style as the spirit moved them: Scotland in 
1700, England in 1752, Russia in 1918. So long as the two calendars co¬ 
existed, all international correspondence had to be conducted with reference 
to both. Letters had to carry the two versions of the date- '1/12 March 
1734' or '24 October/7 November 1917'. 

As a result, numerous curiosities prevailed. Since the discrepancy 
between the calendars amounted in the seventeenth century to ten or eleven 
days, it was possible to sail across the English Channel from Dover and 
arrive in Calais in the middle of the following month. Similarly, since the 
Old Style year began on 25 March and the New Style year on 1 January, it 
was possible to leave Calais in one year and to reach Dover in the previous 
year. Europe did not work in full synchrony until the Bolshevik government 
abandoned the Old Style. Nothing happened in Russia between 31 January 
1918 (OS) and 14 February (NS). From 1918 to 1940, the Soviet 
communists imitated the French revolutionaries by abolishing the seven-day 
week, replacing the names of days with numbers, and counting the 'Years of 
the Revolution' from 1917. 3 [[VENDeMiAiRE] 



BAUME 


The Abbey of Baume, says the Guide Michelin, was founded in the sixth 
century by the Irish monk, St Colomban. Its name, of Celtic origin, means 
'grotto', and it was set in one of Europe's most dramatic locations-at the 
bottom of an immense limestone gorge, the Cirque de Baume, in the depths 
of the pine woods of the Jura. Like a convent of the same name, fifty miles 
away on the River Doubs, where the blind St Odile received her sight, it is 
said to date from the era when Gallo-Roman civilization had been overrun 
by the pagan Burgundians, and when Christianity was being rebuilt by 
anchorite communities in the wilderness. It grew into an institution of great 
wealth and power, possessing several hundred villages and benefices. 
Eventually, the chapter turned itself into a secularized community of 
aristocratic canons. It survived until 1790, when revolutionaries dissolved 
the abbey, smashed most of its monuments, and changed the name of the 
town from Baume-les-Moines to Baume-les-Messieurs. 1 

In the history of Christian monasticism, the Burgundian communities 
like Baume form an important link between the anchorite system of the 
ancient world, as preserved in Ireland, and the great medieval foundations 
which appear from the tenth century onwards. After all, it was from Baume 
that Berno and his companions set out in 910 to found the great abbey of 
Cluny (see p. 315). 

For readers of the Guide Michelin, however, it is a disappointment to 
find that many of these details of Baume's past are at best unauthenticated 
legends. There is no hard evidence to connect Baume with St Colomban, and 
there is no reason to suppose that it was founded in the sixth century. In fact, 
the first definite mention of a Cellula at Balma dates from 869-which 
makes it younger than St Odile's convent at Baume-les-Dames. In all 
probability, the link with St Colomban was invented by the monks of Cluny, 
who thereby embellished the pedigree of their parent house. 2 

Similar doubts surround Baume's most colourful personality-Jean, 
Seigneur de Watteville (1618-1702), abbot for forty years during the reign 
of Louis XIV. Soldier, murderer, and monk, de Watteville had once fled from 
justice to Constantinople, where he rose to the rank of pasha and governor of 



Morea, before obtaining a papal absolution. According to Saint-Simon, he 
was an example of a sinner redeemed by true repentance. According to the 
record, he was a habitual turncoat whose treachery facilitated the brutal 
French conquest of his native province of Franche-Comte. His tombstone 
reads thus: 

ITALUS ET BURGUNDUS IN ARMIS 
GALLUS IN ALBIS 

IN CURIA RECTUS PRESBYTER 
ABBAS ADEST. 3 

('Here lies an Italian and a Burgundian soldier, a Frenchman, when he took 
the cowl, an upright man in his office, a priest and abbot'). 

Baume, therefore, provides the stuff of legend as well as history. People 
have always had a need to use the past for their own purposes. The writers of 
scientific monographs are playing a losing game. The past as transmitted to 
posterity will always be a confused mixture of facts, legends, and downright 
lies. 


The emancipation of the papacy cannot be pinned on a particular date. The 
Bishops of Rome possessed a large measure of freedom long before they 
asserted their claims to supremacy. Growing differences between the Latin and 
the Greek parts of the Church led to frequent schisms of a temporary nature, but 
not to an irreparable breach. Oddly enough, in the first four centuries, when 
Rome was still the heart of the Empire, the Roman Church had often been 
dominated by Greeks and by Greek culture. Leo I (440-61) was the first to 
emphasize its Latinity. In the same period the Latin Patriarchs broke free from 
immediate political control, sheltering behind the city of Rome in its many 
affrays with the civil power. The resultant separation of ecclesiastical and secular 
authority, so typical for the West and so foreign to the East, was an established 
fact from then on. In the sixth century the Patriarchs of Rome had to face first 
the restoration of imperial power under Justinian, and then the Lombards. Two 
of their number, Silverius (536-7) and Vigilius (537-55), found themselves 
under imperial arrest. The latter was brutally bullied into submission by the 
imperial authorities on the Monophysite controversy. 




Gregory I (540-604), the first monk to sit on St Peter's throne, is often 
regarded as the architect of future papal power through both his administrative 
skills and his stand on principle. Self-styled 'servant of the servants of God', he 
ran the civil affairs of the city of Rome, negotiated a settlement with the 
Lombard kings, reorganized the Church's lands and finances, and restored 
Roman contacts with Africa, Spain, Gaul, and Britain. His Regula Pastoralis 
(Pastoral Care) quickly became the handbook for medieval bishops. He 
repeatedly protested against his brother of Constantinople using the title 
of'Oecumenical Patriarch'. By the time of his death, the balance was shifting in 
Rome's favour. Preoccupied by the Muslim onslaught, the emperors lost almost 
all influence in Italy, though several desperate demonstrations of imperial claims 
were attempted. As a result of the Monothelite affair, Martin I (d. 655), the last 
papal martyr, died in exile in Crimea, having been kidnapped by the Exarch of 
Ravenna, flogged, and banished by a court in Constantinople, [cantus] 


CANTUS 

The plainsong of the Latin Church, or cantus planus, is often called 
Gregorian Chant in honour of the Pope who fixed its eight component modes 
and collected some 3,000 melodies. Together with the related idiom of 
Byzantium, it is thought to have derived from Greek and especially Jewish 
traditions of chanting. In turn, it became the foundation on which European 
music was built. It was used for the unaccompanied singing of psalms, 
hymns, and antiphons, customarily in unison and in free rhythm. It had four 
main 'dialects'-Ambrosian, Roman, Gallican, and Mozarabic, though the 
Roman school gradually gained ascendancy. Initially, it was not written 
down; and the early forms cannot be reconstructed with certainty, [musike] 

The notation developed for plainsong passed through several stages. The 
Byzantines, like the Greeks, used a literal system to designate notes, 
supplemented by neums or 'accents' to indicate the movement of the 
melodic line. The Slavic Orthodox preserved the system long after it was 
superseded elsewhere: 





a. 11th Century Kufisma Notation without stave, b. 12th-13th Century 
Russian notation using a Graeco-Byzantine literal system, c. 17th-20th 
Century: musical signs used in Russian Orthodox liturgical notation. (After 
Machabey.) 

In the West, as expounded in the Frankish treatise De harmonica 
institutione by Hucbald of St Amand (c.840-930), a similar convention had 
been adopted whereby neums were placed over the syllables of the Latin 
text. Notker Balbulus of St Gall explored tropes or 'melodies added to the 
main chant'. In the eleventh century, the musicologist Guido d'Arezzo 
(c.995-1050) invented a notational system which is the progenitor of the 
tonic sol-fa. 

Taking the initial syllables of the lines of Ut queant laxis, the Hymn to St 
John the Baptist, he established the ascending hexachord of UT-RE-MI-FA- 
SOL-LA. The seventh syllable SI, for (S)ancte (l)ohannis, was added later. 
He also devised a spatial stave of up to ten lines, forerunner of the modern 
five-line stave. It had a mobile key signature, and carried a 'square notation' 
of 'points' and 'rods'. It is debatable whether the notes had fixed duration or 
accentuation: 





rum fimu-li tu-d-rum, Sdl-ye pollu-ti Ubi-i re-i-tum. 



Sincte Jo-innes. 



Ui qu£ - am li - xi> - so - na • re fi brii 




lu - ci la - bi • i re * i - turn. Sin - etc- Jo - in - nei. 


('Let Thine example, Holy John, remind us | Ere we can meetly sing thy 
deeds of wonder, | Hearts must be chastened, and the bonds that bind us | 
Broken asunder.') 3 

From the late twelfth century onwards, Gregorian chant was enriched by 
the art of polyphony, where two or more independent melodic lines were 
sung in parallel. The practice encouraged the growth of instrumental 
accompaniment. The medieval ear only recognized concordance in octaves, 
fourths, and fifths. But the introduction of fixed measures, perhaps from 
folksong and dance, and the need for counterpoint where the melodies 
crossed, encouraged the study of rhythm and harmony. These, together with 
melody, constitute the basic elements of modern musical form. The art of 
canon began in the thirteenth century. From then on, a standard vocabulary 
of musical phrase could communicate a wide range of emotion and meaning. 



Europe's 'language of music' has a continuous history, therefore, from 
plainsong to Stravinsky. 4 

In the nineteenth century, the so-called 'Caecilian movement' regarded 
Gregorian chant as the one true source of European music. The Benedictine 
monks of Solesmes, near Le Mans, undertook the task of reconstituting its 
theory and practices. Their work, which inspired among other things Liszt's 
Christus, is regarded as the principal modern authority. 


In the eighth century, the Emperor could no longer mount even a 
demonstration of power in the West. In 710 Emperor Justinian II summoned the 
Roman Patriarch to Constantinople, and Constantine (708-15), a Syrian, 
dutifully obeyed. At their meeting-the last, as it proved, between Roman 
bishop and reigning emperor-the emperor ceremonially kissed the Roman feet, 
receiving absolution and communion in return. But Constantine was murdered 
shortly afterwards; and their agreement over Ravenna came to nothing. In 732 
Emperor Leo fitted out a fleet to recover Ravenna, which had been conquered by 
the Lombards, and to arrest Gregory III (731-41) who had defied the edict on 
Iconoclasm. But the fleet sank in the Adriatic. Thereafter, for all practical 
purposes, the Roman Patriarchs were totally independent. No subsequent bishop 
of Rome ever sought the imperial mandate for his election. No imperial officials 
from Constantinople could ever exert their authority in Rome. 

In any case, the Patriarchate of Rome already possessed the means to support 
its independence. As guardian of the Roman pilgrimage, which grew greatly in 
importance once Islam sealed off the road to Jerusalem, it attracted huge prestige 
and a ready income. In the Decretals it had a body of legal decisions that would 
come to service its wide jurisdiction, especially after the codification of Canon 
Law (see p. 349). In the Patrimony of St Peter (the Church's landed estates), 
which would soon be greatly expanded, it possessed a solid basis for temporal 
power. In its alliances with the Lombards, and then with the Lombards' rivals, 
the Pranks, it had the means to obtain international protection. The unity of the 
Christian Church still existed in theory, in reality it had gone. The title of Papa 
had once been affectionately applied to all bishops. Henceforth it was reserved 
exclusively for the bishop of Rome. This was the era when the papacy was born, 
[reverentia] 

The seventh General Council (787), the second at Nicaea, was devoted to 




Iconoclasm. It declared in favour of an opinion sent from Rome by Hadrian I. 
Images could be venerated, but not with the same adoration due to God. This 
was to be the last occasion on which Rome and Constantinople were to take 
common action in matters of faith. 


REVERENTIA 

One day in the sixth century, whilst travelling with his mother between 
Burgundy and Auvergne, the young Georgius Florentius (the future Gregory 
of Tours) was caught in a storm. His mother waved a bag of holy relics at the 
lowering sky, the clouds parted, and the travellers passed on unscathed. At 
first, the conceited boy took the miracle to be a reward for his own good 
behaviour, whereupon his horse stumbled and threw him to the ground. It 
was a lesson in the wages of vanity. On another occasion, whilst visiting the 
shrine of St Julien at Brioude, Gregory developed a splitting headache. 
Putting his head into the self-same fountain where the head of the 
decapitated martyr had once been washed, he found the headache was cured. 
It was a lesson in reverentia -in the precise observation due to hallowed 
things and places, and in their healing power. 

Since the end of the era of persecution, the cult of martyrs and the 
collection of holy relics was moving into the centre-ground of Christian life. 
Primary relics were those directly connected with the main figures of the 
Gospels. Secondary relics, with less immediate links, also came to be 
accepted. Constantinople became the main collecting and distributing centre. 
Its prize possessions, apart from two fragments of the True Cross, included 
the Crown of Thorns, the Sacred Lance, the Virgin's Girdle, and several 
heads of John the Baptist. After the second Council of Nicaea ruled that all 
new churches should be consecrated in the presence of relics, a brisk trade 
developed. The body of St Mark was snatched from Alexandria in 823, and 
brought to Venice. The body of St Nicholas reached Bari in 1087. Western 
crusaders were to be the greatest relic-mongers of all. 

The reverence for relics, so evident in Gregory of Tours, has often been 
dismissed as mere credulity. Yet close examination shows that it provided 
the vehicle not only for an emerging code of personal ethics but also for the 




more subtle games of social politics and social status. Reverentia was the 
mark of a true believer. Its absence marked the pagan, the illiterate, or the 
complacent. Clerics who officiated at the translation of relics gained in 
stature, consolidating the consensus or approbation of the flock. Churches or 
cities in possession of high-grade relics gained in prestige, in divine 
protection, and no doubt in the revenue from pilgrims. It is a nice paradox 
that Christian belief in the soul's departure for Paradise should have been 
surrounded by the paraphernalia of death, and by special veneration for 
bones and tombs. It was accompanied by an almost Baroque sensibility 
which stressed how the very special dead emitted the scent of lilies and 
roses, the aura of shining lights, and the sound of angelic choirs. 1 

With time, however, relics were necessarily devalued. When all the 
apostles, martyrs, and fathers of the Church had been claimed, there was a 
danger that every dead bishop would be declared a saint. Bishop Priscus of 
Lyons, who was elevated to the see in 573, would have none of it. He buried 
his predecessor, Nicetius, in a standard tomb, and allowed his deacon to 
wear Nicetius' chasuble as a dressing-gown. As it happened, both Priscus 
and Nicetius were canonized, but only in 1308. 

The Protestant Reformation waged war on relics, and many shrines were 
then destroyed. But the Protestant rage affected neither the Orthodox nor the 
Catholic world. The mummies or skeletons of the Very Special Dead can 
still be viewed in many an Italian church as in the catacombs of the 
Pecharskaya Lavra, the 'Monastery of the Caves' in Kiev. One of the most 
extraordinary collections of relics, the twelfth-century Treasure of the Priory 
of Oignies, has survived intact at Namur. Twice buried to defy the treasure- 
hunters of the French Revolution and of the Nazi Occupation, its priceless 
items include St Peter's Rib, St James's Foot, and the Virgin's Milk. All are 
encased in dazzling reliquaries, each gruesomely shaped to fit the anatomical 
form of the contents, and fashioned from gold and silver filigree, gemstones, 
and silver-on-black niello. Designated among 'the Seven Wonders of 
Belgium', they are kept by the Sisters of Our Lady at 17 rue Julie Billiart, 
Namur. 2 



The Export of Christianity, 395-785 

From the day that Christ said 'Follow me', Christianity has been an evangelical 
religion. And from St Paul's confirmation that it was open to all comers, there 
were no limits to its potential constituency. But once the Empire had adopted 
Christianity as the state religion, religious conversion became a matter of 
imperial policy. For Christian rulers, the export of the faith was directed not just 
at individual souls but at whole nations: it was a question of strategic ideology. 
For the would-be converts, too, the acceptance of Christianity involved political 
considerations. There was much to be gained in terms of literacy and trade. But 
the decision to import Christianity from Rome, or from Constantinople, or from 
neither, involved a crucial political choice. 

Ireland came to notice at an early date owing to the apparent spread there of 
Pelagianism. As a result, Germanus of Auxerre, a Gallo-Roman bishop, took a 
close interest both in the British Isles and in Brittany. One mission headed by 
Palladius, the 'first Bishop of the believing Irish', who landed at Wicklow in 
432, was fruitless; but a second mission by St Patrick (c.385-461), a British 
disciple of St Germanus, had lasting results. At Tara in Meath he confronted the 
High King, Laoghaire, kindled the paschal fire on the hill of Slane, and silenced 
the Druids. The first episcopal see was established at Armagh in 444. 

The Frankish conquest of Gaul was closely bound up with the religious 
divisions of the province. By the fifth century the Gallo-Roman population had 
been fully converted to Roman Christianity long since. But the Visigoths, 
Burgundians, and Alamans who first overran them were Arians, whilst the 
Franks in the north had remained heathen. Clovis did not accept baptism from 
the hands of St Remi, Bishop of Rheims, until some point between 496 and 506. 
But by doing so from one of the Roman bishops, he allied his Merovingian 
dynasty with the Gallo-Roman populace against their initial barbarian rulers. He 
is said to have used the Catholic bishops of Aquitaine as a 'fifth column'. The 
'Catholic connection' of the Franks, therefore, undoubtedly facilitated the 
consolidation of their power, and laid the foundation for their special relationship 
with Rome. Much of our knowledge about early Frankish Christianity derives 
from the Historia Francorum of Gregory of Tours (540-94). Yet Gregory's 
eulogy of the Merovingians cannot hide the fact that Clovis, his 'New 
Constantine', was something of a savage. Gregory tells the story of the looted 
vase of Soissons, which had been smashed to pieces by a Frankish warrior who 
refused to share the spoil. Clovis waited until the Champ de Mars, the annual 



parade, of the following spring, where he chided the vase-breaker over the state 
of his equipment. As the warrior bent down to reach for a weapon, Clovis 
smashed his skull with a battle-axe, saying, 'Thus didst thou to the vase of 
Soissons'.- 

In the sixth century the Christian world was still reeling from the inroads of 
the barbarians. One series of counter-measures was undertaken by Irish 
missionaries. Another was launched by the Emperor Justinian, whose 
reconquests of Africa, Italy, and Spain were motivated in part by the desire to 
root out Arianism. A third was the work of Gregory I. The Irish missions, which 
began in 563 with the arrival of St Columba (c.521-97) on Iona, were directed 
first at northern Britain and then at the Frankish dominions. Twenty years later 
St Columbanus (c.540-615) set out with a band of companions from the great 
monastery at Bangor, bound for Burgundy. He founded several monasteries, 
including Luxeuil; sojourned at Bregenz on Lake Constance; offended the 
Merovingian kings by excoriating their loose living; and died at Bobbio, near 
Genoa. St Gall (d. 640) missionized what is now Switzerland, giving his name to 
the great religious centre of St Gallen. St Aidan (d. 651) moved from Iona to 
Holy Island (Lindisfarne) c.635, thereby advancing the conversion of England. 
In all these instances the Irish monks followed practices that were out of step 
with Rome. Major problems were to arise in the subsequent period in reconciling 
the Celtic and the Latin traditions, [iona] 

Iberian Christianity was shaken by the imperial invasion of 554. The Arian 
Visigoths had lived apart from their subjects, who constantly conspired with the 
imperials of the south. After decades of convulsion, in which the Visigothic 
kingdom barely held its own against internal rebellion and external attack, 
Reccared (r. 586-601)-son of an Arian father and a Roman mother-peacefully 
accepted Catholicism as an act of policy. The decision was confirmed by the 
second Council of Toledo (589). [compostela] 

In Italy, at almost the same moment, the Arian Lombards accepted 
Catholicism on the occasion of the marriage of their King Agilulf with the 
Catholic Frank, Theodelinda. At the basilica of Monza, near Milan, which they 

founded, the iron crown of Lombardy can still be seen with its inscription: 
AGILULF GRATIA DEI VIR GLORIOSUS REX TOTIUS ITALIAE OFFERT SANCTO IOHANNI 
baptistae in ecclesia MODICAE. Conflict between Catholics and Arians persisted 
until the eventual Catholic victory at Coronate in 689. [leper] 



IONA 


One evening in May 597, the ageing St Columba expired on the altar steps 
of his abbey church on the tiny, treeless Hebridean island of Iona. He had 
been copying the Psalms, and had just transcribed the verse of Psalm 34: 
They that seek the Lord shall want no good thing. 5 A native of Donegal, he 
had founded many churches in Ireland, starting with Derry, before landing 
with twelve brothers on the Innis Druinidh, The Isle of Druids' in 563. The 
'Apostle of Caledonia', who crowned the King of Dalriada in his island 
church, he was instrumental in the expansion of Celtic Christianity and 
Gaelic civilization to western Scotland. By its mission to Lindisfarne in 
Northumbria, his community would also launch the Christianization of 
northern England. He died in the same year that St Augustine of Canterbury 
established the Roman mission in Kent. 

The fate of the Celtic Church on Iona is instructive. It survived the 
terrible Viking raid of 806, when the abbot and 68 monks were killed. The 
monks of St Columba's tradition were driven out c.1200, when Reginald, 
Lord of the Isles, set up a Benedictine monastery and Augustinian convent in 
their stead. These establishments were already dead or moribund when, in 
1560, the reformed Church of Scotland abolished monasticism outright. The 
island itself passed into the hands of the Campbell Dukes of Argyle, who in 
1899 returned it to the Church of Scotland with a view to restoration. The 
reconstructed cathedral was reconsecrated in 1905. The reconstituted Iona 
community, dedicated to ecumenical work and prayer, was founded by Dr 
George Macleod in 1938. 1 Every age has its own brand of Christianity. 


England is said to have caught the attention of the Roman Patriarchs when 
Gregory I saw fair-headed boys for sale in the slave-market. Non Angli, sed 
angeli (not Angles, but angels), he remarked. Shortly afterwards, in 596-7, he 
dispatched one of his monks, St Augustine of Canterbury (d. 605) to convert the 
heathen English. Within a short period Ethelbert, King of Kent, was baptized, 
and sees were set up at Canterbury, Rochester, and London. The complex story 
of English Christianity forms the life-work of the 'Venerable' Bede (673-735), 




monk of Jarrow in Northumbria, whose History of the English Church and 
People is one of the monuments of the age. Bede was specially interested in the 
conflict between the northern and southern missions, with their rival centres at 
York and Canterbury, and in their eventual reconciliation at the Synod of Whitby 
(664). He also records the extensive correspondence of Pope Gregory with 
Augustine: 

Augustine's Eighth Question. May an expectant mother be baptised? How soon after childbirth may she 
enter church? And how soon after birth may a child be baptised if in danger of death? How soon after 
childbirth may a husband have relations with his wife? And may a woman enter church at certain periods? 
And may she receive Communion at these times? And may a man enter church after relations with his wife 
before he has washed? Or receive the sacred mystery of communion? These uncouth English people require 
guidance on all these matters.- 


COMPOSTELA 

According to legend, the body of St James the Apostle, together with its 
severed head, was brought in a stone boat from Palestine to Galicia some 
time in the fourth century. The mooring-post to which the boat was tied is 
preserved in the tiny harbour church at Padron near Corunna. News of the 
event began to circulate more widely, and some two hundred years later the 
site of the saint's shrine at Libredon, or Santiago, attracted a growing stream 
of pilgrims. In 859, an invocation to St James gave the Christians of Leon a 
miraculous victory over the Moors. The saint gained the epithet of 
Matamoros or 'Moorslayer'; and Leon grew into a sovereign kingdom. From 
899 a new cathedral was built over the saint's tomb as a focus for the 
pilgrimage. Its emblem was the pilgrim's scrip and the Atlantic starshell, la 
Compostela. 

Pilgrims' motives were not simple. Some set out from a belief in the 
power of famous saints to intercede for their souls. Some set out for a cure. 
Many went for the joy of fellowship, for a rollicking adventure, or for baser 
reasons of lust, gain, or escape. Santiago was specially attractive because it 
lay 'as far as one could go', and because it was chosen by the Church as a 
place of formal penance. 

Four long pilgrim trails led half-way across Western Europe to Santiago 





(see Appendix III, p. 1253). One started at the Church of St Jacques in Paris, 
and led south via Tours, Poitiers, Saintes, and Bordeaux. The second started 
at Ste Marie-Madeleine at Vezelay in Burgundy, leading south-west through 
Bourges and Limoges. The third started at the cathedral of Notre Dame at Le 
Puy-en-Velay in Auvergne. All three converged at the Pass of Roncevalles in 
the Pyrenees. A fourth route left St Trophime in Aries, led westwards to 
Toulouse, crossed the Pyrenees at the Col de Somport, and met the three 
other routes at Puente la Reina on the River Arga. For the last 250 miles, 
through the ever-wilder scenery of Asturias, Burgos, and Leon, all pilgrims 
walked along the same Camino de Santiago until they stood before the 
Portal de la Gloria. 

At its height in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the pilgrimage to 
Santiago was a major transcontinental business. English and Irish pilgrims 
often made first for Tours, or sailed to Talmont on the Gironde. The 
Germans and Swiss came down the Rhone to Lyons en route for Vezelay or 
Le Puy. Italians sailed to Marseilles or direct to Arles. Guide books were 
written. Abbeys and shrines on the way, such as the Abbey of Ste Foy at 
Conques, grew rich from pilgrims' donations. The refuge at Roncevalles 
served 30,000 meals a year. Churchyards along the road received the 
remains of those who could go no further. 

Historians discuss the factors which made for the unity of Christendom. 
Santiago de Compostela was certainly one of them. 1 


LEPER 

In 643 King Rothar of Lombardy issued a decree: Tf any man become a I 
leper... and is expelled from his city or dwelling, let him not donate his 
possessions to anyone. For on the very day he is expelled, he is considered 
dead.' 1 This, in itself, is enough to dispel the myth that leprosy came to 
Europe with the Crusades. 

The ostracism of lepers is attested throughout the Middle Ages. 
Byzantium, which possessed at least one lazar-house in the fifth century, 




shared the same attitudes. Leviticus 13 offered ample biblical support. 
Lepers were forced to live beyond town limits; they had to wear a long robe 
of distinctive colour marked by the letter L; and they had to signal their 
approach by bell, clapper, or horn, or by shouting, 'Unclean, unclean!' The 
sixth-century Council of Lyons formally placed them under the care of 
bishops. In fact, they lived from begging. In 1179 the Third Lateran Council 
formalized the procedures. Suspect lepers were to be examined before a 
priest or magistrate and, if found infected, were to be ritually separated from 
the community through an act of symbolic burial. 

A description of this ceremony, the separado leprosorum, was written 
down at St Algin's in Angers. The penitent leper stood in an open grave with 
a black cloth over his head. The priest said: 'Be dead to the world, be reborn 
in God.' The leper said: 'Jesus, my Redeemer... may I be reborn in Thee.' 
Then the priest read the proscription: 

I forbid you to enter church, monastery, fair, mill, marketplace or tavern 
...I forbid you ever to leave your house without your leper's costume, or to 
walk barefoot... I forbid you to wash or to drink in the stream or fountain ... 
I forbid you to live with any woman other than your own. If you meet and 
talk with some person on the road, I forbid you to answer before you have 
moved downwind ... I forbid you to touch a well, or well cord, without your 
gloves. I forbid you ever to touch children, or to give them anything ... I 
forbid you eating or drinking, except with lepers. 2 

The leper was then led in procession to the place of exile. 

Some rulers sanctioned more ferocious methods. In 1318 Philip V of 
France charged the country's lepers of being in league with 'the Saracens', 
and of poisoning wells. He ordered them all to be burned, together with Jews 
who gave them counsel and comfort. 3 In 1371, 1388, 1394,1402, and 1404 
the municipality of Paris vainly called for the leprosy laws to be enforced. 
The ferocity of their reactions derived from the rooted belief that leprosy 
was a punishment for sexual depravity. The disease carried a heavy moral 
stigma, which caused the risk of contagion to be grossly exaggerated. 

Even so, leprosy affected high and low. It struck down Baldwin IV, King 
of Jerusalem, and Hugh d'Orivalle, Bishop of London (d. 1085). Physicians 
had no clue of its bacterial cause, and few suggestions for its relief. 
Following Avicenna, they stressed its supposed psychological symptoms of 



craftiness and lust. The leprosarium or lazar-house was a common sight 
beyond city walls. In England the leper colony at Hambledown, near 
Canterbury, grew into a sizeable settlement. At Burton Lazar it was located 
near the healing waters, later used for brewing. 

Medieval literature used leprosy as a sensational device. In several 
versions of Tristan and Isolde, the heroine is saved from burning only to be 
thrown to the lepers: 

Do sprach der herzoge, ich wil sie 
minen sichen bringen, 
die suln sie alle minnen 
so stirbet sie lesterlichen. 

(The Duke spoke: I will bring her to my sick ones. They will all love her, 
so that she will die dishonourably.) 4 

By all accounts leprosy greatly declined in sixteenth-century Europe. Its 
place was taken by syphilis [syphilus.] But prejudices'did not change. In 
1933 the OED defined it as 'a loathsome disease', elephantiasis graecorum. 
And in 1959 a popular American novelist could be criticized for repeating all 
the old degrading stereotypes. 5 Leprosy was the medieval counterpart to 
AIDS. 


Gregory was specially solicitous to adapt heathen practices to Christian usage. 

We have come to the conclusion that the temples of idols ... should on no account be destroyed. He is to 
destroy the idols, but the temples themselves are to be aspersed with holy water, altars set up, and relics 
enclosed in them ... In this way, we hope that the people may abandon idolatry ... and resort to these places 
as before ... And since they have a custom of sacrificing many oxen to devils, let some other solemnity be 
substituted in its place... They are no longer to sacrifice beasts to the Devil, but they may kill them for food 
to the praise of God... If the people are allowed some worldly pleasures... they will come more readily to 
desire the joys of the spirit. For it is impossible to eradicate all errors from obstinate minds at a stroke; and 
whoever wishes to climb to a mountaintop climbs step by step .. .- 

This caution no doubt explains the ultimate success of the missions: but it 
envisaged an extended period where thinly veiled heathen practices coexisted 
with a slowly evolving Christianity. Generally speaking, the Church was 
successful in its evangelical mission because it managed to appeal to the 
'barbarian' outlook. It was able to convince its converts that only through 





baptism could one become part of the civilized order. The interplay of Christian 
authors with pagan themes, which is evident, for example, in the Anglo-Saxon 
poem Beowulf, provided a central feature of cultural life over a very long period. 

In the East, the emperors were too preoccupied with the Muslim onslaught to 
show much concern for the souls of their non-Christian subjects and neighbours. 
For the time being, the great Sclavinia was largely left to its own devices, as 
were the Bulgars. In the seventh and eighth centuries Constantinople contented 
itself with the rehellenization and rechristianization of the Peloponnese and the 
islands. It is not an episode which commands much comment in modern 
histories of Greece. Crete remained in Muslim hands until the tenth century. 

Despite the example of the Franks, the Germanic tribes to the east of the 
Rhine held Christianity at arm's length for two centuries more. The task of 
conversion was left to English missionaries from the north, and to Frankish 
warriors from the west. St Wilfred of York (634-710), whose Catholic line had 
been carried at Whitby, began by preaching in Friesland in 678-9. But the 
central figure was undoubtedly St Boniface of Crediton (c.675-755), creator of 
the first German see at Mainz, founder of the great abbey at Fulda (744), and 
martyr of the faith at Dokkum in Friesland. Boniface had many close assistants, 
among them the well-named SS Sturm and Full, who quarrelled over Fulda, St 
Willibald of Bavaria (c.700-86), the first known English pilgrim to the Holy 
Fand, his brother St Winebald of Thuringia (d. 761), and his sister St Walburga 
(d. 779), abbess of Heidenheim. 

The peaceable work of the English missionaries was complemented, not to 
say disgraced, by the merciless campaigns of the Franks in Saxony between 772 
and 785. Submission to Christianity was an absolute condition of the Frankish 
conquest, where butchery and treachery were the normal instruments both of 
attack and resistance. The sacred grove of Irminsul was axed at the outset; and 
mass baptisms were performed at nearby Paderborn, and again in the Ocker and 
the Elbe. The Saxon rebels, some 4,500 of whom were beheaded in the massacre 
of Verden (782), were finally broken when their leader, Widukind, surrendered 
to the holy water. Missionary bishoprics were created at Bremen, Verden, 
Minden, Munster, Paderborn, and Osnabriick. 

The advance of Christianity into central Germany marked the beginning of a 
strategic change. Up to that point Christianity had been largely confined to the 
Roman Empire, or to lands which retained an important leaven of ex-Roman, 
Christian citizens. To a large extent it was still the 'imperial religion', even in 



places that had long since severed their imperial links. But now it was edging 
into countries that had never claimed any sort of connection with the Empire. 
The Rhineland had once been a Roman province; Saxony had not. Whilst several 
ex-Roman provinces still awaited the return of the faith, especially in the 
Balkans, Christianity was starting to creep into untouched heathen territory. 
After Germany, Slavdom awaited its turn, and beyond the Slavs, Scandinavia 
and the Balts. 

If the first stage of Christianization, the conversion of the Empire, had taken 
400 years, the second stage, the reconversion of the former Roman provinces, 
was drawing to a close after another 400. The third stage, the conversion of 
virgin heathendom, was to last for six long centuries after that (see pp. 321-8, 
430). [biblia] 

At first sight it may seem that the processes which provide the main themes of 
the Dark Ages were not closely related. What is more, none of them came to an 
end during this period. The long procession of barbarian irruptions continued 
until the last Mongol raid of 1287 (see pp. 364-6). The split between East and 
West was projected from the imperial to the ecclesiastical plane, and was not 
formalized until 1054 (see p. 330). The Christian conversion of Europe's pagans 
was not completed until 1417 (see p. 430). The soldiers of Islam were still on the 
march when the Ottomans landed in Europe in 1354 (see p. 386). Only then was 
the Roman Empire finally heading for extinction. 


BIBLIA 

The 6th century Codex Argenteus (Cod. DG 1 fol. 118v) is kept in the 
University Library at Uppsala. It was brought to Sweden from Prague. 
Written in silver letters on purple parchment, it is probably the finest early 
copy of the Gothic translation of the Bible completed by Ulfilas (Wulfilla, 
c.311-83). Wulfilla, or 'Little Wolf', the Arian grandson of Christian 
captives, was consecrated 'Bishop of the Goths' during their sojourn on the 
Danube frontier. His translation of the Bible into Gothic started the long 
history of vernacular scriptures and of Germanic literature. 




The Codex Amiatinus, now in the Laurentian Library in Florence, is not 
quite so old. It was written at Jarrow in Northumbria c.690-700 during the 
rule of Abbot Ceolfrid. It is the oldest extant copy of the Vulgate, St 
Jerome's translation of the scriptures into Latin. It was based on an older 
Vulgate copy by Cassiodorus (see p. 266), and was presented by Abbot 
Ceolfrid to the Papacy, whence in turn it was lodged in the Abbey of Amiata. 
The vellum on which it was written was made from the skins of 1,500 
animals. 

It is worthy of note that Wulfilla completed his Gothic translation prior 
to St Jerome's translation of the Bible into Latin. Both of them based their 
translation on older Greek texts, of which there was no single authoritative 
version. Modern reconstructions of the early Greek scriptures are based on 
the 4th-century Codex Vaticanus from Alexandria, on the 4th-century Codex 
Sinaiticus, brought from Mt. Sinai and sold to the British Museum by a 
Russian Tsar: on the 5th-century Codex Alexandrinus, also in the British 
Library, which came from Constantinople, and the 5th-century Codex 
Ephraemi in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris. 

The task of establishing a totally accurate and reliable text of the 
scriptures, suited to each passing generation, has always been impossible. 
But the attempt has to be made ceaselessly. The Old Testament was written 
in Hebrew and Aramaic, the New Testament in Hellenistic Greek. The 
former was put into Greek, as the Septuagint, for the use of the Greek¬ 
speaking Jews in Alexandria. So, in theory, a complete Greek text of both 
testaments may be thought to have existed from the 1st century ad onwards. 

Those books which make up the present Bible, in its Catholic and 
Protestant forms, number almost one hundred. They could not be collated 
into a unified pandekt of both Testaments, until the basic canon was 
established in the 4th century. In the meantime, numerous variations of every 
book of the Bible, together with the uncanonical apocrypha, circulated 
separately. They are only known to modern scholarship in the fragments 
found in ancient papyri, in passages quoted by the Fathers, in various pre- 
Vulgate 'Old Faith' texts, and in the work of ancient Judaic and Christian 
critics. Among the latter, by far the most important was the wonderful 
Hexapla of Origen, who wrote out six Hebrew and Greek versions of the Old 
Testament in six parallel columns, [papyrus] 

Not even the Vulgate existed in systematic form. As St Jerome 



completed successive sections of his work, he sent each off to assorted 
destinations. They, too, have to be unscrambled from the variegated biblical 
compilations into which they were inserted. What is more, the work of 
medieval copyists resembled nothing more than the game of 'Chinese 
Whispers', where errors are compounded at every stage. It is easy to see why 
the Greek word biblia or holy 'books' (pi.) originally existed only in the 
plural. Uniform biblical texts were not attainable until the age of printing. 
[press] 

By then, however, Christendom was on the verge of the Reformation 
when Protestants would challenge all previous biblical scholarship. 
Protestant scholars were specially dedicated to vernacular translations for 
which they needed authoritative texts of the Hebrew and Greek originals. 
Hence a whole new era of bibliology was characterized by Protestant- 
Catholic rivalry. 

In 1907 a Vatican Commission entrusted the preparation of a definitive 
edition of the Vulgate to the Benedictines. Work has continued throughout 
the twentieth century. When it may be complete, as one stoical Benedictine 
remarked, 'God only knows'. 1 


None the less, these various processes did interact; and the essential effects 
of their interaction can be identified by the time that most of the Mediterranean 
was conquered by the armies of the Prophet. It was the four centuries following 
Constantine that brought Europe into being. This was the period when the 
majority of the Peninsula's diverse peoples found their way to permanent 
homelands. This was the period when the rump of the Roman Empire became 
just one among many sovereign states in a community of 'Christendom' that was 
consolidating behind the screen of Islam. No one yet used the name of 'Europe' 
to describe this community, but there can be little doubt that it was already in 
existence. 

Mons Iovis, The Pennine Alps, c.25 November ad 753. It was very late in the 
season, just before the winter snows. Stephen II, Bishop and Patriarch of Rome, 
was hurrying to cross the Alps before the roads were blocked. He had come from 
Pavia on the Po, the capital of the Lombard kingdom, and was entering the 
kingdom of the Franks. He was heading in the first instance for the monastery of 




St Maurice on the upper Rhone. From there he would make for the royal villa of 
Ponthion on the Marne-a journey of nearly 500 miles. Averaging ten or twelve 
miles a day, it would take him six weeks.- 

The Mons Jovis, 'Jupiter's Mount', carried one of two Roman roads 
constructed seven centuries earlier to link the provinces of Cisalpine and 
Transalpine Gaul. Also known as Alpis Poenina or 'Pennine Pass', it had once 
been the gateway to the lands of the Helvetii. It reached an elevation of 2,476 m 
or 8,111 ft. The stone-paved roadway, 4 metres wide, had been designed for 
wheeled traffic, which in the old days would have covered the 55 miles from 
Augusta Praetoria (Aosta) to Octodorus (Martigny) in one day. In the eighth 
century the going was harder. The locals would have called it by a name that was 
part-way between the Latin Mons Jovis and the modern Monte love or 
Montjoux.- 

Stephen II had been raised to St Peter's throne in unexpected circumstances 
twenty months previously. The orphaned son of an aristocratic Roman family, he 
had been brought up in the patriarchal palace of St John Lateran, and had served 
Patriarch Zacharias (r. 741-52) as deacon. A career administrator, he had been 
sufficiently senior to put his signature to the acts of the Roman synod of 743. So 
a decade later he was probably in middle age. After Zacharias's death he would 
have been present when an elderly priest, also called Stephen, was chosen to 
succeed. He would have shared the sense of shock when Priest Stephen died of a 
stroke, unconsecrated, after only four days; and he must have been totally 
unprepared when he himself was acclaimed on the same day. Thanks to Priest 
Stephen's uncertain status, Deacon Stephen is variously numbered as Stephen II, 
Stephen III, or Stephen II (III).- 



Map 11. Pope Stephen's Journey, ad 753 

Zacharias, a learned Greek from Calabria, had been pursuing a line of policy 
established by his predecessors, Gregory II (715-31) and Gregory III (731-41). 
Whilst resisting the Iconoclastic demands of Emperor Constantine Copronymos, 
he had taken care not to break with the Empire. At the same time he had 
followed northern affairs with close interest. He had been in constant touch with 
St Boniface, whom he commissioned as legate to romanize Frankish church 
practices. Most importantly, at the request of the Franks, he had issued a formal 
ruling which stated that it was desirable for royal titles to be held by those who 
actually exercised power. In effect, he had authorized the deposition of the last 
Merovingian king. He had signed a twenty-year truce with the Lombards on 
behalf of the city of Rome, and had tried to mediate in the Lombards' quarrels 
with the Byzantine Exarch of Ravenna. But in the last year of his life he had 
been powerless to restrain the Lombards' aggressive new king, Aistulf. In 751 
Aistulf seized Ravenna, before marching south. When Lombard agents started to 




exact an annual tax from Rome, it was clear that the long-established freedoms 
of the city and the Patriarch were directly threatened. These were the events 
which had provoked the journey by Zacharias's successor. 

Francia or 'Frankland', the largest of the successor states to the western 
Roman Empire, had been ruled for 300 years by the descendants of Merovech 
(d. 458), grandfather of Clovis I. It stretched from the Pyrenees to the Weser. Of 
its three constituent parts, Neustria, centred on Paris, and Burgundy on the 
Rhone were still essentially Gallo-Roman, whilst Austrasia in the East, centred 
on Rheims, was the original Frankish homeland and predominantly Germanic. 
Over the generations it had frequently been partitioned and reunited. In the 
eighth century the Merovingian monarchy had lost all but nominal control to 
Austrasia's hereditary 'mayors of the palace', the Arnulfings, who exercised 
effective rule over the whole country. In 751 it was the Mayor, Peppin III, 
Charles Martel's grandson, who had sent envoys to Patriarch Zacharias to ask 
'whether it was just for one to reign and for another to rule'. On receiving the 
desired answer, he had deposed his king, Childeric III, and seized the throne. 
(See Appendix III, p. 1246.) 

As the travellers toiled to the top of the pass, the state of the road amidst the 
grandiose rigours of the mountains must have made a deep impression. The once 
smooth pavement was cracked, jagged, overgrown, and in places completely 
washed away. Its great stone slabs had been left unrepaired for longer than 
anyone remembered. The imperial posts had ceased to function. In a hollow 
below the barren, mist-strewn summit, the ruins of the Temple of Jupiter 
Poeninus stood forlorn beside the frozen lake. Having lived all his life within 
sight of the decaying Forum, Stephen did not need to be reminded about the 
passing of Roman glory. But the desolation of the pass must have matched his 
mood. He cannot have ignored the fact that he was embarking on something that 
none of his predecessors had risked. Though Gregory II had once prepared a 
similar journey, it was called off. No bishop of Rome had ever crossed the Alps. 
When Stephen started the long descent to St Maurice he must have pondered the 
implications. He was not acting on impulse. He had sent for assistance to 
Constantinople, but in vain. He had visited Pavia, and had appealed to King 
Aistulf in person, but to no effect. He was turning to the Franks in a final, 
calculated step to avert disaster. If an anachronistic phrase is permitted, he was 
'calling in the New World to redress the balance of the Old'. 

The Christendom in which the Roman Patriarch was seeking to establish a 



more central role was smaller than it had been in the past, or was destined to be 
in the future. It had been greatly diminished by the Arab conquests of the 
previous century, and had not yet spread to the lands in the centre and east of the 
Peninsula. The Byzantine Empire had withstood the Arab siege of 718, but was 
hemmed into the Balkans and Asia Minor. The Muslims had recently won the 
whole of the western Mediterranean and most of Iberia. Though driven back 
from the Loire some twenty years before, they still held much of southern Gaul, 
where the Gothic cities of Nimes and Beziers were in a state of revolt. If Stephen 
had crossed the neighbouring pass of the Alpis Graia, some twenty miles to the 
west, he would have found himself descending into Muslim territory. 

At that juncture, Latin Christendom was confined to a narrow corridor 
mnning from the British Isles to central Italy. Half-way between the Lindisfarne 
Gospels and the Book of Kells, the Celtic art of illumination was at its peak. In 
England, the Venerable Bede had died just eighteen years back. His mantle in 
Anglo-Saxon scholarship had passed to Alcuin, who was to make his name in 
Prance. The central part of Germany had only just been converted. Its patron, St 
Boniface, had passed away only two years before, leaving the Abbey of Pulda 
and its choir-school in its infancy. The Lombard rulers of Italy had been 
Catholics since the previous century, but they looked with suspicion on the 
liberties of Rome. They smelled treason whenever the Patriarchs had sided with 
the citizens against Pavia. Their control of central and southern Italy, through the 
duchies of Tuscany, Spoleto, and Benevento, was contested by the Byzantines, 
whose themes (or provinces) of Sicily, of Calabria, and of Naples were still 
intact. 

By far the greatest part of the European Peninsula was still held by heathen 
tribes. Scandinavia was fast approaching the point of explosion when its wild 
Viking raiders would pour out over the northern seas. The heathen Prisians and 
Saxons had been repeatedly ravaged by the Pranks, but had not been finally 
subdued. At this very moment, the Prankish ruler whom Stephen was going to 
meet, Peppin the Short (r. 751-68), was resting at Bonn, having just completed 
the latest of his punitive campaigns into Saxony. Further east, the heathen Slavs 
held all the lands from the mouth of the Elbe to the Aegean. In addition to the 
Elbe, they commanded almost all the great rivers-the Oder, the Vistula, the 
middle Danube, and the Dnieper. Kiev had recently been recorded as a staging- 
post on the river route from the Baltic to the Black Sea and Mesopotamia. 

Fortunately for Christendom, the Muslim world was in turmoil. The Abbasid 



caliphate was in the early stages of moving its centre of gravity from Arabia to 
Persia. Al-Mansur was on the march. His son, Harun-al-Rashid, who would be 
known to history as the hero of the Thousand and One Nights, was a young boy. 
The last of the defeated Umayyads was on his way to Spain to found the emirate 
of Cordoba. 

The events of Patriarch Stephen's journey have to be reconstructed from two 
main sources-one Roman, the other Frankish. The Vita Stephani forms part of 
the huge compilation known as the Liber Pontificalis, which is made up from a 
long series of biographies and decretals dating from the sixth to the ninth 
centuries.- It is at pains to present the episode from the papal point of view. In 
contrast, the third continuation of the Chronicle of the Pseudo-Fredegar forms an 
appendix to the main Frankish record of the Merovingian era.- It is confined to 
the reign of Peppin III, and was written on the orders of Peppin's relative 
Nibelung. It is at pains to present the Carolingian point of view. The emphases 
and omissions of the two sources have given historians a broad range of 
interpretation. 

The sources say little directly about the political bargain which inspired 
Stephen's journey; yet the outline is clear. Although Peppin had taken the 
precaution of seeking papal advice before his coup d'etat, and had probably been 
consecrated by St Boniface, his right to rule was obviously open to question. 
Equally, although Stephen II had consulted both the Emperor and the Lombard 
King, his appeal to the Franks must have been unsettling to both of them. The 
essence of the deal that was brewing, therefore, was that Rome should provide 
what Peppin lacked in legitimacy if the Franks would supply what Rome was 
lacking in force of arms. Stephen II was willing to give his religious sanction to 
Peppin's rule in return for Peppin restoring political order in Italy. 

Later tradition assumed that a sovereign Roman papacy had every right to act 
without reference to the Byzantine Emperor. But that was to read history 
backwards. Formally, the Patriarch of Rome did owe allegiance to the Empire. 
His virtual immunity in the Eternal City had been gained without legal sanction. 
Not that there is reason to suppose that he was deliberately seeking to damage 
the Empire's interests. After all, he had started out in the company of the 
imperial ambassador, who accompanied him to Pavia for the interview with 
Aistulf. In recommending his plan to Peppin he was to use the phrase 'for the 
cause of St Peter and the Roman Republic'. Prior to the formation of the Papal 


State, respublica romanorum could only have referred to the Byzantine Empire. 
Calling in one barbarian chief to fight off another was one of the Empire's oldest 
tactics. So it has to be argued that calling in the Franks was not in itself an act of 
disloyalty. Stephen II did not breach his faith with the Empire until the end of the 
story. 

The Patriarch's initial progress is recorded in the Liber Pontificalis. He 
leaves Rome on 15 October, and travels to Pavia. The malignus rex 
langobardorum, The evil king of the Lombards', hears him out but fails to 
deflect him from his purpose. He leaves Pavia on 15 November: 

Unde et cum nimia celeritate, Deo praevio, ad Francorum coniunxit clusas. Quas ingres-sus cum his qui 
cum eo erant, confestim laudes omnipotenti Deo reddidit; et coeptum gradiens iter, ad venerabile 
monasterium sancti Christi martyris Mauricii... sospes hisdem beatissimus pontifex... advenit. 


(From Pavia, with God's aid, he reached the gates of the Frankish Kingdom with tremendous speed. Having 
crossed [the pass] with his entourage, he gladly rendered praise to Almighty God. The start of the journey 
was steep, but the blessed pontifex [came through] unhurt to the venerable monastery of St Maurice, a 
martyr of Christ.)- 


He was travelling in the company of a dozen high-ranking priests, and was 
escorted by the Frankish envoys Duke Aitchar (Ogier) and the Chancellor, 
Bishop Chrodegang of Metz. 

At St Maurice the Patriarch was welcomed into the Frankish realm by 
Peppin's personal representative, Abbot Fulrad of St Denis. The monastery was 
built on the site of Agaunum, where five centuries before the Roman centurion 
Mauricius had met his death, having urged the soldiers of the Theban legion to 
disobey orders rather than fight their fellow Christians. From there, a message 
was sent to Peppin to arrange the rendezvous at Ponthion. The messengers found 
the King in the Ardennes, on his way back from Bonn. Peppin sent instructions 
for his young son Charles to ride out and meet the visitor on the road. After 
leaving St Maurice, Patriarch Stephen rounded Lake Lemanus and crossed the 
Jura. His encounter with the King's son took place somewhere in Burgundy in 
late December. The twelve-year-old Charles had made a hundred miles south 
from Ponthion. 

Stephen reached Ponthion on 6 January 754. According to the Roman 
account, the King came to greet him outside the town, dismounted, prostrated 
himself, and personally held the Patriarch's bridle. At which point, in tears, the 
Patriarch beseeched the King's aid: 


'Beatissimus papa praefatum Christianissimum regem lacrimabiliter deprecatus 
est, ut per pacis foedera causam bead Petri et republicae Romanorum disponeret. 

(The blessed pope tearfully begged the supreme and most Christian king that he 
would reach agreements in the cause of peace, of St Peter, and of the Roman 
Republic.)- 

According to the Frankish account, 'the Pope of Rome came into the King's 
presence ... showered rich gifts upon him and his Franks, and asked for his help 
against the Lombards and their king on account of their double dealing'.- 
Peppin then handed Stephen to the care of Abbot Fulrad, to winter at St Denis. 

In the following weeks Peppin exchanged embassies with Aistulf. A 
Frankish envoy was sent to Pavia, enjoining the Lombards to desist from their 
seizures of territory and their 'heretical demands'. Aistulf countered by sending 
Peppin's younger brother, Carloman, as his envoy to the Franks. (Carloman had 
retired to a monastery in Rome, and was thus a resident of the Lombard realm.) 
On 1 March the Franks held their annual parade, the Champ de Mars, at 
Bernacus (Berny-Riviere, Aisne). Then at Cariascum (Quercy), at Easter, on 14 
April, they assembled to discuss the destination of the season's campaign. Not 
without dissent, they decided to march against the Lombards. 

Here the sources diverge. The continuator of Fredegard's Chronicle relates 
how the Frankish army crossed the Alps at Mont Cenis and inflicted a crushing 
defeat on the Lombards in the Val de Susa. The Liber Pontificalis, in contrast, 
relates how at midsummer Stephen reconsecrated Peppin and his Queen Bertrada 
at St Denis, anointing them with holy oil and granting them the title of 
'Patricians of the Romans'. Peppin's sons and heirs were given the papal 
blessing to rule in perpetuity. The historicity of these proceedings is confirmed in 
another contemporary document, apparently an eyewitness account, the Clausula 
de Uncdone Peppini. One may surmise that Frankish commentators were 
embarrassed by the fact that Peppin's desire for reconsecration underlined the 
impropriety of his earlier coronation. 

The consequences took a couple of years to clarify. After the first Frankish 
victory, Aistulf submitted to Peppin and the Bishop was restored to Rome. 
Within months, however, the Lombards broke their oath and returned to their 
attacks. In 756, therefore, Peppin mounted a second campaign against 
Lombardy, capturing Pavia and crushing all resistance. On this occasion, if not 
before, the Franks took the former Exarchate of Ravenna away from the 


Lombards and donated it to the Patriarch. By doing so they created the territorial 
basis for the Papal State. By accepting it as part of the patrimony of St Peter, in 
defiance of Byzantine claims, the Bishop revealed that his allegiance to the 
Emperor had been renounced. 

Yet several items remain confused. It seems that many important details were 
written into the sources after the event. In this kind of operation the papal 
chancery was specially expert. The Liber Pontificate states, for example, that the 
'Donation of Peppin' was made not in 756 but in 753 at Quercy. What is more, it 
insists that Peppin was merely returning a property to which Rome possessed 
ancient title. As is now known, the papal chancery was concocting the spurious 
Donation of Constantine at this very time. Until the forgery was unmasked in the 
fifteenth century, all loyal Catholics were misled into believing that the Roman 
Church had received the Exarchate of Ravenna from the hands of the first 
Christian emperor 400 years before Peppin. It would appear, therefore, that the 
false 'Donation of Constantine' may have been concocted in order to reinforce 
the genuine Donation of Peppin. It also appears, in the midst of his chastisement 
of the Lombards, that Peppin established friendly relations with the Byzantines. 
The Frankish continuator says that he doesn't know what happened to this 
friendship except that it didn't flourish.- What happened, of course, was that the 
Byzantines asked for the return of their Exarchate, only to be told that it had 
recently been given to the Pope. Betrayed by Rome and powerless against the 
Franks, the Byzantines were left trying to make common cause with the 
Lombards. 

As so often in history, the long-term consequences were not foreseen. The 
Franks were unable to disentangle themselves from Italy. The Bishop of Rome 
put himself in a position to be recognized as the supreme Patriarch, 'the Pope' 
the papacy gained the territorial basis for a sovereign state; and the Franco-papal 
alliance became a durable feature of the international scene. By daring to cross 
the Alps, Stephen II had personally forged the link which gave the north a 
permanent voice in the affairs of the south. Above ah, the authority of the 
Empire was critically weakened in the West. The boy who had ridden out to 
greet Bishop Stephen in Burgundy was left with the idea that he might found an 
empire of his own. 

* 'Vlach' or 'Wloch' is the old Slavonic word for Latin. It gave rise to a 
number of Vallachias-Old Vallachia in Serbia, Vallachia Major in Thessaly, 
Vallachia Minor in northen Romania, Wallachia in southern Romania, and 


Maurovallachia, the land of the Negrolatini or 'Black Vlachs' in the Dinaric 
Alps. Wlochy is still the usual Polish word for 'Italy'. 

* The name Grand St Bernard was not adopted until after the 11 th c, when St 
Bernard of Montjoux (d. 1008) built hospices on the summits both of the Alpis 
Poenina and of the Alpis Graia (the Little St Bernard). The breed of huge St 
Bernard dogs, which were trained to rescue travellers from the snow, dates from 
the same period, 3 centuries after Stephen ll's journey.

MEDIUM 

The Middle Age, c.750-1270 




There is an air of immobility about many descriptions of the medieval world. 
The impression is created by emphasizing the slow pace of technological 
change, the closed character of feudal society, and the fixed, theocratic 
perceptions of human life. The prime symbols of the period are the armoured 
knight on his lumbering steed; the serfs tied to the land of their lord's demesne; 
and cloistered monks and nuns at prayer. They are made to represent physical 
immobility, social immobility, intellectual immobility. 

Medium Aevum, 'the Middle Age', was a term first used by devout Christians 
who saw themselves living in the interval between Christ's first and Second 
Coming. Much later it was taken up for different purposes. Renaissance scholars 
began to talk in the fifteenth century of the 'Middle Age' as the interval between 
the decline of antiquity and the revival of classical culture in their own times. 
For them, the ancient world stood for high civilization; the Middle Age 
represented a descent into barbarism, parochiality, religious bigotry. During the 
Enlightenment, when the virtues of human reason were openly lauded over those 
of religious belief, 'medievalism' became synonymous with obscurantism and 
backwardness. Since then, of course, as the 'Modern Age' which followed the 
Middle Age was itself fading into the past, new terms had to be invented to mark 
the passage of time. The medieval period has been incorporated into the fourfold 
convention which divides European history into ancient, medieval, modern, and 







now contemporary sections. By convention also, the medieval period is often 
subdivided into early, high, and late phases, creating several successive Middle 
Ages. Of course, people whom later historians refer to as 'medieval' had no 
inkling of that designation. 

Unfortunately, there are no clear lines which mark the end of the ancient 
world or the beginning of modern times. The start of the medieval period has 
been fixed at any number of points from the conversion of Constantine onwards. 
Its end has variously been fixed at 1453, at 1493, at 1517, or even, by those who 
use their own definition of feudalism as the touchstone of medievality, at 1917. 
Almost all medievalists would agree, therefore, that the label which defines their 
subject is unsatisfactory. Many who base their views on a knowledge of Western 
Europe alone would stress the contrast between the destructive tendencies of the 
early medieval phase and the constructive tendencies of the later phase. In this 
scheme, the 'Dark Ages' of the fifth to eleventh centuries are characterized by 
the progressive dismemberment of the Roman world; the turning-point is 
reached with the so-called 'twelfth-century renaissance'; and the peak of 'high' 
medieval civilization is reached in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. These 
distinctions bear little relation to the East, where the Roman Empire survived 
until 1453, and where no 'renaissance' in the Western sense was ever 
experienced. 

Most would agree, however, that the unifying feature of the medieval world 
is to be found in organized Christianity. Here they would accord with the people 
of medieval Europe, who, if asked, would have seen themselves as Christians, 
living in the Christian era and in the Christian part of the earth. Yet Christendom 
itself was an elastic concept. It contracted and expanded over the centuries in 
response to the wars with Islam and the campaigns against the pagans. It was 
never exactly coterminous with the Peninsula of 'Europe'. The Christendom 
known to Stephen II, when he crossed the Alps in 753, was a very different place 
from the Christendom of 1453, when the Turks scaled the walls of 
Constantinople. 

The vacuum left by the decline of the Roman Empire was filled by the 
growing awareness of Christendom, not just as a religious community but also as 
a coherent political entity. Though the Roman Empire ultimately perished, its 
religion triumphed. The spiritual and temporal leaders of Christianity gradually 
assumed the mantle of the Caesars. In the West, where the Empire first 
crumbled, it was the Bishop of Rome who conceived the notion of a new order 



predicated on the joint authority of the Latin Church and a Catholic Emperor. 
The Papacy', wrote Thomas Hobbes, £ is no other than the Ghost of the deceased 
Roman Empire sitting crowned upon the grave thereof.'- The chosen instrument 
of the Papacy was found in the new Caesars or 'Kaisers' of Germany. In the 
East, where the Roman Empire survived far longer, the notion of a substitute 
order, based on the authority of the Greek Church and of a new Orthodox 
Emperor, had to await the emergence of the Caesars or 'Tsars' of Moscow. 

In this light, if the central theme of the Middle Ages is taken to be the 
reorganization of Christendom into new imperial systems, a clear chronological 
framework emerges. The first step may be seen in the coronation of 
Charlemagne on Christmas Day in the year 800, the last step in the definitive 
adoption of the title of Tsar by Ivan III, Grand Duke of Moscow, in 1493. 

From an early stage, however, the growing community of Christendom was 
divided against itself. Though the Latin and the Greek Churches shared all their 
basic beliefs, they often regarded each other as aliens. Though impartial 
observers might see them as two variants of the same faith, like the Sunnis and 
the Shiahs of the Muslim world, they were more conscious of their differences 
than their commonality. In the first millennium they maintained at least a facade 
of unity; in the second millennium they abandoned the facade. The old crack 
opened wide after the schism of 1054. Here was proof that even the foundations 
of Christendom were subject to movement. 

"=="- 


750-1054 

From the eighth century onwards, faltering thoughts about a new political order 
were stimulated by continuing depredations from beyond the fringe of 
Christendom. The foundation of the Empire of Charlemagne in 800, of the Holy 
Roman Empire from 962, and eventually of the Tsardom of Moscow can only be 
understood in conjunction with the activities of the Vikings, the Magyars, the 
Mongols, and the Turks. 

The Vikings or 'Northmen' ravaged the northern coasts for more than 200 
years. They were the product of overpopulation in the remote fiords of 
Scandinavia, whose 'rowmen' took to their longships for plunder, trade, 




mercenary service, and sheer adventure. From c.700 parties of Vikings would 
raid isolated settlements in the British Isles or Frisia before sailing home at the 
end of each season. They ransacked Lindisfarne in 793 and Iona in 795 [iona]. 
From the middle of the ninth century, however, huge Viking camps were set up 
to act as bases for more protracted campaigns of pillage. In several instances 
these camps led to permanent settlement. The Danish Vikings, for example, 
created one such 'great army' at the mouth of the Seine, from which they 
repeatedly looted the defenceless cities of northern France. They captured ports 
such as Rouen and Nantes, whilst sailing off to Portugal (844), to the Balearic 
Islands, even to Provence and Tuscany (859-62). In 851 they invaded England, 
fanning out through the eastern half of the country. From 866 the 'Danelaw' was 
established from Northumbria to East Anglia. The struggle between the Anglo- 
Saxons and the Danes dominated the next 150 years of England's history. In 911, 
tradition holds that the Northmen of the Seine were permanently settled under 
Rollo, thereby creating 'Normandy'. 

The Norwegian Vikings concentrated on the outer islands. They occupied the 
Orkneys and Shetlands in the eighth century, the Faroes, the Hebrides, and 
eastern Ireland in the ninth. Their major colony, Iceland, was settled from 874. 
Dublin was founded in 988. They discovered Greenland; and in all probability, 
under Eric the Red, they sailed on to North America, which they called Vinland. 
[eirik] The Swedish Vikings operated throughout the Baltic. They established 
fortified camps at Wolin on the Oder, at Truso on the Vistula, and at Novgorod, 
whence they penetrated the rivers of the Bay of Riga and the Gulf of Finland. In 
the ninth century they took hold of the overland route between the Baltic and the 
Black Sea. Known as Varangians, they controlled the Dnieper, and appeared in 
Constantinople, [dirham] [futhark] 

In the final period, adventurers of Viking origin, who had acquired a veneer 
of the culture of their adopted countries, created a number of new political states.

Rurik the Varangian and his sons organized the first durable principality of the 
eastern Slavs at Novgorod and Kiev, c.860-80. Knut the Dane or 'Canute the 
Great' (r. 1016-35) was lord of a vast North Sea empire joining England with 
Denmark (see p. 308). Robert Guiscard, the Norman, sailed to southern Italy in 
1059 (see p. 336). William the Bastard, Duke of Normandy, conquered the 
kingdom of England in 1066 (see p. 339). Norman rule was destined to last 
longer in Sicily and in England than in Normandy itself, [ding] 


DIRHAM 





On 12 May ad 922, a caravan walked into the Bulgar city of Suvar on the 
Volga. It had been travelling for more than three months from the port of 
Jurjan on the Caspian Sea. It was led by an Arab merchant, Ibn Fadlhan, 
who wrote an account of his travels. 1 It is one small incident in the history of 
commercial contacts between Eastern Europe and the Arab states of Central 
Asia over five centuries. Ibn Fadlhan was coming to buy furs; and there is no 
doubt that he was carrying a plentiful supply of dirhams to pay for his 
purchases. 

The dirham or dirhem was a coin of pure silver weighing 2.97 grammes, 
and worth one-tenth of a dinar. It was minted both in North Africa and in 
Central Asia under various dynasties. It was standard currency in Eastern 
Europe in the era before local mints existed. Hoards of dirhams have been 
found all over European Russia, Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Baltic States, 
Sweden, and northern Poland. The largest of them contained over 50,000 
coins. Buried by their owners in times of insecurity, they sometimes 
remained uncollected until found by modern archaeologists and treasure- 
hunters. They can be dated quite precisely from the date of the newest coin 
in any particular lot. 

Analysis of dirham hoards indicates four recognizable periods. In the 
first period, c.800-25, the hoards contain Abbasid dirhams, predominantly 
from North Africa. They may well reflect Khazar-Arab trade links via the 
Mediterranean [khazaria] In the second period, 825-905, the North African 
issues disappear, and are replaced by Central Asian coins. In the third period, 
905-60, the hoards still consist overwhelmingly of Samanid issues, but are 
joined by large numbers of Buwayhid and Ziyarid issues.- 

In the Viking Age, when Swedish Vikings controlled the Baltic-Dnieper 
route, dirhams were taken all over the north, [futhark] [rus'] Important 
finds have been made in Sweden, and especially on the island of Gotland. 3 
Indeed, as Ibn Fadlhan recorded when he encountered a party of Swedes, the 
possession of dirhams had become a matter of status and public ostentation: 

T saw the [Swedes] when they landed and camped beside the Volga. I never 
saw statelier men. They are as tall as palm-trees, ruddy-cheeked, and with 
red hair. They wear neither kirtle nor caftan, but the men have a rough cloak 
which they throw to one side, leaving their hands free ... 




Fastened on the breasts of the women is a capsule of iron, copper, silver 
or gold according to the wealth of the husband. In the capsule is a ring, and 
attached to it, a knife ... Round their necks, they wear gold and silver chains. 
For when a man owns 10,000 dirhems, he has one chain made for his wife; 
for 20,000, she has two chains. Thus [an extra] chain is added [to the wife's 
neck] for each 10,000 dirhems that the husband possesses.' 4 

The import of Arab silver to Eastern Europe faltered in the late tenth and 
ended in the early eleventh century. The latest Samanid dirham found in 
Sweden dates from 969, in Russia from 1015. This used to be attributed to a 
'silver crisis' in Central Asia. But other factors were at work. The end of the 
re-export of Arab silver from Rus' to Sweden coincides with the appearance 
of silver deniers from Western Europe. By the end of the eleventh century, 
Arab coins had been totally supplanted. The details may be obscure; but the 
numismatic evidence clearly supports developments known from other 
sources, namely the reorientation of the Baltic trade and the rise of 
Novgorod. 


The Magyars were the last of the nomads to colonize central Europe. 
Descendants of the Ugrian branch of the Finno-Ugrian peoples, their earliest 
known cradle-land lay east of the Urals in the valleys of the Irtysh and Ob. They 
parted company with their Finnic kinsfolk in the third millennium bc. 
Thenceforth they occupied successive stations on the southern steppes, gradually 
adapting themselves to the nomadic life, first in 'Magna Hungaria' between the 
Kama and Ural rivers, later in 'Lebedia' north of the Sea of Azov, and finally in 
the land of Etelkoz or 'mesopotamia' between the Dnieper and Dniester (see 
Appendix III, p. 1240). On the steppes of the first millennium, the Magyars were 
the neighbours of the Scythians, Sarmatians, Alans, Bulgars, Khazars, Uzi, and 
Pechenegs. They were already divided into their seven tribes: Nyek, 
Kurtgyarmat, Tarjan, Jeno', Ker, Keszi, and Magyar-the last name being later 
applied to them all. Byzantine sources speak of their trading in slaves through 
the Black Sea ports. 

The Magyars' decisive move was made at the end of the ninth century. The 
steppe peoples had been in commotion for several decades. The Arabs dispersed 
the Uzi and stole their cattle; the Uzi did the same to the Pechenegs. In 894 the 
Pechenegs made common cause with the Bulgarian Tsar, and together they fell 




on the Magyars. The time had come for what the Magyars themselves call the 
hon-foglolas, The occupation of the fatherland'. Overwhelmed by their 
neighbours, they decided to migrate to the west. For the first time their 
horsemen, who in recent years had lent their services both to the Franks and the 
Byzantines, did not return to Etelkoz. Instead, with Arpad at their head, they led 
the long trains of their people over the Verecke Pass in the Carpathians. It was 
the spring of 895 at the latest. Perhaps 20,000 warriors and 400,000 tribesfolk 
had come to found the land of the Magyars on the plains of 'Hungaria'. [csaba] 

[SHAMAN] 

The Mongols, or Tartars', commanded the greatest of all the nomadic 
empires. Centred on the arid steppes of central Asia, their fortunes waxed and 
waned; but they directly impinged on the affairs of the West on two separate 
occasions. Genghis Khan (r. 1206-27), starting from Karakorum, conquered a 
territory which stretched from the Pacific to the Black Sea, from Korea to 
Crimea (see p. 364). The renewer of the Mongol empire, Timur or Tamerlane 
(1336-1405), starting from Samarkand, mastered an area somewhat more to the 
south, from Delhi to the Aegean. Indirectly, it was the Mongols who set another 
Central Asian people in motion. The Turks originated in Turkestan, whence they 
were displaced in the eighth century and where related peoples still live. They 
were destined to appear on the horizons of the West first with the Seljuk Turks in 
the eleventh century (see pp. 332-3) and then with the Ottoman Turks in the 
thirteenth (see p. 386). The story of their epic wanderings encompasses the 
whole span which in the West separated Charlemagne from the end of the 
Crusades. 


DING 

The custom among Germanic tribes of holding popular assemblies was 
described by Tacitus: and there is little doubt that they had existed since 
prehistoric times. The earliest such assembly to enter the historical record, in 
the ninth-century Legend ofAnsgar, was the Ding which met at Birka on the 
island of Bjorko in Sweden. A similar assembly met at a similar period in 
Denmark. 

Iceland's national assembly, the Althing, came into being in ad 930 




under the Law Rock by the lake at Thingvellir. Thereafter, it met annually 
'after ten weeks of summer' and was attended by the island's thirty-six clan 
chiefs and by their chosen delegates or thingmen, who elected the 
Lawspeaker. It appointed judges, passed laws, and made executive decisions, 
adopting the principle of majority voting from 1130. Each year, it was 
preceded by the Maytime farthings or 'regional assemblies' of the island's 
four quarters, and was followed by the leid -a meeting when the populace 
was informed of decisions taken. It was the centrepiece of Iceland's 'free 
state', which continued until the 'Old Treaty' of 1264 and the Norwegian 
takeover. 1 

The Manx Assembly on the Isle of Man, the Tynwald, like that of the 
Faroes, dates from a similar early period, [Faroe] 

Nordic democracy put special emphasis on local assemblies. Every 
Swedish province had its ding, like Iceland's farthings, in each of the 
country's twelve jurisdictions. Denmark had three landlings, and Norway its 
logthings. At the lowest level in Iceland, a system of hieppar or 'farmers' 
gatherings' functioned from the eleventh to the nineteenth centuries. These 
traditions greatly modified the ambitions of Nordic kingship, and obstmcted 
Scandinavian political union. When the Nordic countries did eventually 
enter the Union of Kalmar (see p. 431), it was for dynastic reasons that did 
not last. The Charter of Rights which was forced on the Danish King Erik 
dipping in 1282, and the Swedish equivalent of 1319, were more extensive 
than England's Magna Carta. All had their roots in a much older political 
culture. 2 

Nor was the influence of Nordic democracy confined to Scandinavia. It 
had an impact everywhere the Vikings went-in England, in Scotland, in 
Russian Novgorod, and very probably in Poland, where the same legal right 
of rebellion took root (see p. 555). Although the Scandinavian countries 
were due to experience an era of absolute monarchy, the tradition of local 
democracy may help to explain the strength of constitutionalism and 
representative government in modern times. 


The empire of Charlemagne consummated the alliance between the Roman 
Papacy and the growing kingdom of the Franks. It was an ephemeral affair, 
barely surviving its founder's death and disappearing completely within a 




century. None the less, its impact was profound. Charlemagne, or Charles the 
Great (r. 768-814), great-grandson of Charles Martel, united the two halves of 
his forebears' realm, Neustria and Austrasia, in a vast territory from the Atlantic 
to the Danube, from the Netherlands to Provence. After fifty-three campaigns 
and a lifetime in the saddle, he succeeded in extending that realm in all 
directions: to the Kingdom of the Lombards south of the Alps (773-4); to 
Saxony (775-804), Bavaria (788), and Carinthia (799); to the March of Brittany 
(786); and to the Spanish March across the Pyrenees (795-7). Having assumed 
the title of 'King of the Franks and Lombards', and confirmed the grant of the 
Exarchate of Ravenna to the Papacy, he had clearly outstripped the rival 
chieftains of his day, and was looking for suitable recognition. For its part, the 
Papacy had severed its links with the Emperor in Constantinople and was 
looking for a permanent protector. Pope Leo III (795-816) was tempted to 
regard the imperial title as vacant after the pathological Empress Irene had 
seized sole power in Constantinople. Moreover, attacked in Rome by a gang of 
his predecessor's relatives who had tried to mutilate him, he was forced to take 
refuge with Charles in Frankland, whither he had earlier sent the keys of St 
Peter's and the banner of Rome, [brie] 

After Charlemagne's early years, the western borders of Frankland were not 
seriously disturbed. The line of the Pyrenees was held against major Muslim 
incursions (see p. 255); and the Caliphate, though prosperous and populous, was 
preoccupied with the internal strife of its constituent states. The Frankish 
position was strengthened by allies among the Christian princes who clung 
tenaciously to the coastland of northern Iberia, first in the Kingdom of Asturias 
and then in the later Kingdoms of Leon, Castile, and Navarre. On the southern 
flank, it was protected by the Christian buffer states which took root in Aragon 
and in the County of Barcelona. Relative security in the west gave Charlemagne 
and his successors the chance to turn their attention to problems elsewhere, 
notably in the east and in Italy, [madonna] 

The Franco-papal alliance was consummated in 800, during Charles's fifth 
journey to Italy. A council of notables had absolved Leo of all crimes, and during 
Christmas Mass, as Charles rose from prayer before St Peter's tomb, the Pope 
slipped an imperial crown on his head. The congregation acclaimed him 'Caesar' 
and 'Augustus', and the Pope knelt in homage before him. Einhard, 
Charlemagne's biographer, claims that the coronation occurred spontaneously; in 
all probability it was carefully rehearsed. In terms of tradition it was entirely 
irregular: Pope Leo had no recognized right to confer the imperial title, and 



Charlemagne had no right to receive it. But it happened. Henceforth, there was a 
Catholic Emperor in the West independent of the Byzantine Empire. The 
barbaric Frankish kingdom was upgraded, dependent on the Pope for its new 
status (see Appendix III, p. 1239). [aquilahpapessa] 


BRIE 

Returning from his campaign against the Lombards in 774, Charlemagne 
halted on the Plateau de Brie, close to the Abbey of Meaux. The monks 
served him a Lenten plate of cheese. They insisted that he eat it whole, 
without removing the crust. Delighted, he promptly ordered two batches of 
Brie to be sent to Aachen every year. Charlemagne's secretary, Einhard, 
recorded a similar incident four years later during the Saracen wars. 
Stopping in the district of Rouergue in the Midi, the King took an instant 
liking to the local blue cheese of ewes' milk that was known and matured 
since Roman times in the limestone caves at Roquefort. 1 

Charlemagne's fine cheeses were matched by a cellar of fine wines. He 
owned many ouvrees or 'enclosures' in the Burgundian vineyard at Aloxe- 
Corton, whose choicest Grand Cru white, 'smelling of cinnamon and tasting 
of gunflint', is still marketed as Corton-Charlemagne. 2 

Brie de Meaux, one of France's 500 listed cheeses, dates from the era of 
early monastic farming. After renneting and airing, the curd is shovelled into 
a flat, straw-based mould, and left to drain on a sloping stone shelf. 
Decanted after 24 hours, it is salted, dried, frequently turned, and matured in 
cellars for 4-7 weeks. The final product measures 37 x 3.5 cm, weighs 3 kg, 
and will have taken up 23 litres of full-cream milk, preferably from a herd of 
Normandy cows. It has a golden-roseate crust, a firm, straw-coloured body, 
and a succulent, ivory ame or 'centre'-literally 'the soul'. It should be eaten 
between thin slices of crusty bread. 

For centuries, Brie was shipped along the River Marne to Paris, where 
the street-sellers shouted 'Fromage de Brye'. It was a royal favourite with 
Charjes VIII and Henri IV, but cost the life of Louis XVI, who was caught in 
the tavern at Varennes through tarrying to eat his cheese. Brie was made 




internationally famous at the Congress of Vienna, where Metternich 
pronounced it le prince des fromages -'the only prince which Talleyrand 
would never betray'. 

The CAP of the European Community is all but killing traditional 
farmhouse cheese. In 1985, some 6,000 tonnes of Brie ANOC (Appellation 
Nationale d'Origine Controllee) were produced, as against over 18,000 
tonnes of 'horrific' industrial Brie. 

In August 1792, when many of the monks of Meaux were killed during the 
revolutionary Terror, one brother, the Abbe Gobert, fled to Normandy en 
route for England. He stopped long enough in a village near Vimoutiers 
(Orne) to show a farmer's wife what he knew about cheese-making. The 
village was called Camembert.- 


MADONNA 

Our Lady of Monserrat is a statue of indeterminate age, though the 
monastery which houses her shrine on the 'Saw-Tooth Mountain' in 
Catalonia was founded in 975. The small wooden figure, which was carved 
in a seated position, possibly in Byzantium, is crowned, and holds an orb on 
one side and the Christ-child on the other. The Child, also crowned, raises 
the right hand in blessing, whilst proffering a pine-cone in the left. The 
Madonna's face, whose elongated features bear a look of utter serenity, is 
black. 1 

In 1384 an icon of the Virgin Mother and Child was brought to the 
Pauline monastery of Jasna Gora, the 'Bright Mountain', near the township 
of Czestochowa in western Poland. It was donated by the Prince of Opole in 
Silesia. Legend was to hold that it had been painted by St Luke on boards 
from the Holy Lamily's table in Nazareth. More likely, it was copied from a 
Byzantine original. The head is covered by a dark cape edged with gold, and 
spangled with fleur-de-lis, and it is crowned beneath a halo. The eyes are 
half-closed, as if by tears, and a countenance of utter sorrow is emphasized 
by two long slashes or sabre-cuts which radiate from the right cheek. The 








face, like that of la Moreneta, is black (see Plate 20). 2 

There is a Black Madonna at Notre-Dame de Rocamadour, centrepiece 
of a group of shrines built in the twelfth century into the cliffs of the Gorge 
d'Alzou in central France. The figure is said to have been carved by St 
Amadour or Amateur, whom legend links with Zacchaeus the Publican, a 
disciple of Christ. 3 Another tiny icon of a black madonna, of Byzantine 
origin, graces the altar of the crypt of Notre-Dame du Port in Clermont/ 1 

In Russia, the Black Virgin of Kazan has long been ascribed miracle- 
working powers. First discovered in 1579, buried in a field, the icon was 
installed in the Bogoroditsky convent in Kazan, shortly after the city's 
conquest by Ivan the Terrible. One copy was taken to Moscow in 1612 to 
mark the expulsion of the Poles from the Kremlin; another was brought to St 
Petersburg in 1710 to mark the benediction of Russia's new capital. A 
grandiose, neo-classical cathedral, completed by Alexander I, was built to 
house St Petersburg's Virgin, which few people knew to be a copy. In 1904 
the original icon was stolen from Kazan. It duly reappeared in Western 
Europe, and was acquired by the Orthodox Church of the USA-thus 
avoiding the fate of many famous Russian icons which were either destroyed 
during the Bolshevik Revolution or deposited in state art galleries. - 

Monserrat, Czestochowa, Rocamadour, and Kazan are but four of the 
countless Marian shrines across Europe. In a continent of white faces, the 
Black Madonnas possess an air of added mystery. La Moreneta, patroness of 
Catalonia, saw the conversion of Ignatius Loyola. She became a focus of 
attention during the Napoleonic Wars, when the monastery was destroyed. 
She is well known in Sicily, in Mexico, and in Bohemia. Wallenstein, the 
Imperial General, was building a chapel in her honour when he was 
assassinated. The Matka Boska or 'Divine Mother' of Czestochowa, the 
'Queen of Poland', first attracted pilgrims during the Hussite Wars, before 
assuming a national role during the seventeenth century (see p. 556). 
Together with her Lithuanian counterpart, the 'Matka Boska Ostrobramska' 
in Wilno, she is celebrated by Poles in all their churches, from Irkutsk in 
Siberia to Doylestown (Pennsylvania). The Virgin of Rocamadour was 
venerated by St Louis in 1245, by Charles le Bel (1324), and by Louis XI 
(1463). She inspired the Litanie de la Vierge Noire (1936) by Francis 
Poulenc. The Virgin of Kazan was adopted as the supreme patroness of the 
Romanov dynasty, a Russian counterpart to the Virgin of Blachernae in 




Constantinople. Unlike her Catholic counterparts, who receive special 
adoration during the Feast of the Assumption, her feast-day is held on 8 July 
(OS). 

The cult of the Virgin Mary finds no place in the Bible. It first appears 
with the doctrine of the Theotokos or 'God-bearer' at the Council of 
Ephesus. It inspired the consecration of S. Maria Maggiore (432) in Rome, 
of Reims Cathedral about the same time, and of the rededicated Parthenon in 
Athens. In sixth-century Byzantium it launched the regular celebration of the 
Feasts of the Annunciation (25 March), the Assumption (15 August), and the 
Dormition, all favourite themes of iconography. From there, it spread 
steadily throughout Latin Christendom. In St Mary it presented a divine 
image of womanhood, the Mater Misericordiae, the Magna Mater, the 
spotless Queen of Heaven, the Mother of God-an ideal foil for the older 
Christian fixation with Eve, the sinner, and with Mary Magdalene, the 
repentant whore. It was vehemently denounced by Protestants, as by modern 
feminists.- But it did not find formal acceptance until the dogma of 
Immaculate Conception in 1854. Demands for recognition of 'the Co- 
redemptress' were rejected at the Second Vatican Council. 

Yet the Blessed Virgin does not cease to inspire. She is the foremost 
subject of Christian art, the recurrent source of mystical visions, 
[Bernadette] [fatima], and the recipient of ceaseless prayers [angelus]. 
The 'fifteen decades' of the Rosary are recited in her honour. Since 1568 the 
Ave Maria or 'Hail Mary' has had a permanent place in the Roman Catholic 
Breviary: 

Hail Mary, full of Grace, the Lord is with Thee. 

Blessed art Thou among women, and blessed is the fruit 
of Thy womb. 

Holy Mary, Mother of God! Pray for us sinners, 

Now and at the hour of our death. 


Charlemagne's kingdom and empire were governed by an itinerant court that 
journeyed incessantly from one domain to the next; by a number of subordinate 
courts established in Neustria, Aquitaine, and Lombardy; and by a network of 
perhaps 300 comitates or 'counties', each headed by an imperial lieutenant or 





'Count'. The work of the Emperor's court was supervised by a staff of clerics, 
initially by the Arch-Chaplain Fulrad and later by the Emperor's favourite 
counsellor, the Northumbrian monk Alcuin. Local bishops were often used to 
supervise the counts, and missi dominici, 'royal legates', toured the realm on 
fixed circuits. Law and order, and all appointments, were administered in the 
name of the King. A central silver coinage was introduced, with 240 denarii to 
the pound. An international executive class, united by royal favour and often by 
marriage, made its appearance. A series of capitularies, or collected edicts, 
strove to encourage uniform rules for both Church and State. The tithe was made 
obligatory. Murder of a priest was made punishable by death. The clergy could 
only be judged by a court presided over jointly by count and bishop. Pagan 
cremations were banned. It may have appeared that a new, centralized political 
order was in the making. In reality, local customs and leaders retained much of 
their force. 

Charlemagne's court was certainly the focus of continental power and 
influence. An entry in the royal annals for 798 reveals its far-flung contacts: 

A legate came from King Alfonso of Galicia and Asturias, Froia by name, who 
handed over a tent of marvellous beauty. But at Easter-time the Nordliudi across 
the Elbe rose in rebellion and seized the royal legates residing amongst them to 
dispense justice ... The king collected an army and defeated them in battle and 
took hostages. And proceeding to his palace at Aachen, he received a Greek 
delegation sent from Constantinople. In this year, the star called Mars was not to 
be seen anywhere in the heavens from July to July. The Balearic Isles were 
plundered by Moors and Saracens. King Alfonso, who had plundered Lisbon, 
sent his legates Froia and Basiliscus in winter-time to the Lord King with 
breastplates, mules and Moorish prisoners as evidence of his victory. Then 
Christmas and Easter were celebrated in this place by the King. 2 

It was in the court of Charles the Great that the ancient term of 'Europe' was 
revived. The Carolingians needed a label to describe that section of the world 
which they dominated, as distinct from the pagan lands, from Byzantium, or 
from Christendom as a whole. This 'first Europe', therefore, was an ephemeral 
Western concept which lasted no longer than Charles himself. 



PAPESSA 


According to persistent medieval tradition, the throne of St Peter was once 
occupied by a woman. In the commonest version Pope Leo IV, who died in 
ad 855, was succeeded by one 'Johannes Anglicus.' Leo's successor had 
greatly impressed the Curia with learned lectures, having studied in Athens, 
but two years later caused grave scandal by dying in childbirth in a Roman 
street. This account can be traced to the work of Martinus Polonus of 
Troppau OP (c. 1200-78), who presented the events as proven fact. His 
Chronicon summorum pontificum imperatorumque was a widely used work 
of reference. A different version made Tope Joan' the successor to Victor 
III, who had died in 1087. In this case, she revealed her sex by giving birth 
while mounting a horse. She was promptly tied to the horse's tail and stoned 
to death. That account appeared in the Universal Chronicle of Mainz 
prepared by another inventive Dominican, Jean de Madly, also in the mid¬ 
thirteenth century. 

It is not remarkable that medieval chroniclers should have told strange 
tales; but it is remarkable that their fabrications should have passed without 
question for centuries. Both Petrarch and Boccaccio believed them. A statue 
of Pope Joan stands alongside those of other popes in the cathedral at Siena. 
When Jan Hus cited her at the Council of Constance as an instance of 
ecclesiastical abuse, he was not corrected. An enigmatic monument near the 
Church of San Clemente in Rome, at the spot where the Pope's child was 
supposedly delivered, is said to have stood undisturbed until the 1560s. No 
scholar seems to have doubted the fable until the Annales of the Bavarian, 
'Aventinus', published in 1554. Its historicity was only demolished 
definitively in treatises written by the French Protestant, David Blondel, in 
1647 and 1657. 

Textbooks of medieval history treat Pope Joan, if at all, as a minor 
curiosity. In fact, she signals a mode of gender image that differed markedly 
from that of a later age. There must have been something inherently credible 
in the fable for it to have persisted so long. Joan herself may not have been 
historical. But the fable certainly was. 1 




Charlemagne, however, was an energetic builder. He built palaces at 
Nijmegen, Engelheim, and Aachen. He bridged the Rhine at Mainz, and linked 
the tributaries of the Rhine and Danube with a canal, the Kaisergrab. He was the 
pioneer of romanesque architecture north of the Alps. By reputation, 
Charlemagne was also a great patron of learning. He himself, though a forceful 
orator, was illiterate. But he employed scholars of repute-Alcuin of York, Peter 
of Pisa, Agobard of Lyons. He collected manuscripts, revised the text of the 
Bible, published grammars, histories, and ballads. His lifestory, the Vita Karoli 
by Abbot Einhard, has been called 'the first secular biography'. Not everyone is 
impressed: one historian has blamed Charlemagne for 'saddling us with a 
literary tradition of derivative book-learning which hangs today like a millstone 
round the neck of our educational system'. 3 [agobard] [pfalz] 

Charlemagne did not hesitate to govern the Church as an integral part of his 
domains. At the Council of Frankfurt of 794 he rejected the decrees of the 
(Vllth) General Council of Nicaea. Bishoprics and abbeys were regarded as 
feudal benefices and subject to the law of treason. Whilst forbidding his bishops 
to engage in battle, he spread the Gospel by fire and sword. Whether he grasped 
the Sermon on the Mount is a moot point. His services to Christianity were 
eventually rewarded by canonization, though the process was obstructed for 351 
years by reports that his sexual conquests were no less extensive than his 
territorial ones. 

Charlemagne died on 28 January 814. On his tomb in Aachen, since lost, a 
portrait was placed, and an inscription: 

Beneath this tomb lies the body of Charles, great and orthodox Emperor, who nobly increased the kingdom 
of the Franks, and reigned prosperously for forty-seven years. He died in his seventies in the year of our 
Lord 814, in the seventh indiction, on the fifth of the Kalends of February. 4 


AGOBARD 

By all the omens, 810 was going to be Charlemagne's worst year. There 
were two eclipses of the sun and two of the moon, all observable in 
Frankland. And sure enough, the Emperor's pet elephant, a gift from the 
Caliph, died; there was a widespread outbreak of cattle-plague; and the Duke 




of Benevento rebelled. 


All this, and more, was faithfully recorded by Agobard, Bishop of Lyons 
(c.779-840). What is more, Agobard found that the common people were 
drawing superstitious conclusions. They believed that their cattle were dying 
from a poisonous dust spread by the Duke of Benevento's spies. They also 
believed that Frankland was being invaded by 'cloud-borne ships' navigated 
by 'aerial sailors'. The invaders were said to be beating down the harvest of 
the Franks with hailstones launched from the sky, before carrying it off to 
the far-away land of 'Magonia'. Agobard was not easily swayed by such 
stories which, after investigation, he duly refuted. Yet he did appear to 
believe that the Catholic Church was being invaded by Jews. When his 
collected works were discovered in 1605, it turned out that he had devoted 
no fewer than five treatises to the Jewish peril. 1 

Agobard's most remarkable departure, however, was to demand the 
establishment of a universal Christian law for a universal Christian 
commonwealth. 'If God has suffered so that all be reconciled in his Body,' 
he wrote, 'is not the incredible diversity of laws ... in opposition to this 
divine work of unity?' 2 Agobard was the first European centralist. 


PFALZ 

Aachen takes its name from the Roman spa of Aquisgranium, 'Waters of 
Apollo-Granus'. Its warm, healing waters explain Charlemagne's choice for 
the site of his favourite residence, the Kaiserpfalz. The French name, Aix-la- 
Chapelle, marks the famous chapel, now part of Aachen Cathedral, which 
Charlemagne added to his palace. 

Charlemagne's chapel was completed in 805. It is a three-tiered octagon, 
built in the Byzantine style of San Vitale in Ravenna, which Charlemagne 
had seen and admired. Its proportions are said to follow the mystical 
numbers of the seventh vision of St John's Revelation. In its day it was the 
largest stone building north of the Alps. Round the interior of the octagon, 
above the first tier of Roman arches, there runs a dedication reputedly 




composed by Alcuin: 


CUM LAPIDES VIVI PACIS CONPAGE LIGANTUR 

Since the living stones have been joined in peaceful harmony, 

INOUE PARES NUMEROS OMNIA CONVENIUNT 

And all numbers and measurements are in agreement 

CLARET OPUS DOMINI, TOTAM OUI CONSTRUIT AULAM 

The work of the Lord who built this hall will shine brightly. 

EFFECTUSOUE PUS DAT STUDIIS HOMINUM 

The completed edifice crowns the pious efforts of the people 

QUORUM PERPETUI DECORIS STRUCTURA MANEBIT 

Whose work will remain forever as a monument of beauty 

SI PERFECTA AUCTOR PROTEGAT ATQUE REGAT. 

If the Author of All things protects and rules over it. 

SIC DEUS HOC TUTUM STABILI FUNDAMINE TEMPLUM 
May God therefore watch over this temple 
OUOD KAROLUS PRINCEPS CONDIDIT, ESSE VELIT. 

Which Charles the Prince has founded on a solid base. 

The decoration of the chapel is heavy with the imperial symbolism 
which Charlemagne and his successors had revived in a new and naive 
Christian setting. A mosaic inside the dome represents the Adoration of the 
Lamb. The ambo or pulpit is encrusted with fragments of Roman pottery, 
glass, and an eagle cameo. Egyptian columns in green and rose porphyry 
support the second tier of arches. The pala d'oro or altar panel portrays the 
Passion in classic Roman relief and in solid gold. The Lotharkreuz or Cross 
of Lothar is a magnificent Christian ornament of beaten gold encrusted with 
antique gems. It is surmounted by a central portrait cameo of the Emperor 
Augustus. The imperial throne, cut from simple slabs of white marble, looks 
down from the first-floor gallery as it did during all the 32 coronations of 
700 years. The message is clear: the Empire which Charlemagne launched 
thought of itself both as Holy and as Roman. 

In the twelfth century, on the orders of Frederick Barbarossa, the chapel 
was turned into Charlemagne's shrine. In 1165 the body of the newly 
canonized saint was transferred to a casket of solid gold. It was surrounded 



by a collection of suitable relics-the loincloth of Christ, the Virgin's girdle, 
a splinter of Charlemagne's skull-all placed in precious reliquaries. 
Barbarossa himself donated a huge, wheel-shaped, iron chandelier, the 
'Crown of Lights', which is suspended in the centre of the octagon and 
which symbolizes the walls of the New Jerusalem. It bears another long 
inscription: 

Jerusalem, celestial Zion; John, herald of salvation saw Thee ... 
Frederick, Catholic Emperor of the Roman Empire pledged this crown of 
lights as a princely gift ... Now, O Holy Virgin, he dedicates it to Thee. O 
Stella Maris, O Star of the Sea, take the humble Frederick into Thy care ... 
and protect the Emperor's wife, Beatrix. 

Today the imperial chapel at Aachen is ranked among the foremost 
wonders of romanesque art. But it is more than that. It provides a history 
lesson more vivid than any book can offer. As visitors enter, they pass 
through the Wolf's Door-so called after the legend of the wolf who cheated 
the Devil for possession of the chapel. It is a dull mind that is not gripped by 
the powerful fusion of the barbarian and the classical, of the Christian and 
the pagan, which provided the spiritual drive of the age. Here is Western 
Europe's greatest memorial to a time when romanesque was a novelty, and 
when the centre of civilization still lay in the East. 1 


Charlemagne's lifeblood had been the cement of the realm. His inheritance 
was immediately disputed by his son and grandsons. Repeated partitions ensured 
its early disintegration. In 817 the partition of Aachen provoked civil war; in 
843, following protracted family slaughter, the Treaty of Verdun produced a 
three-way split between the surviving grandsons. Charles the Bald received the 
Western, Romance sector-Neustria, Aquitaine, western Burgundy, and the 
Spanish March. Lothair I, King of Italy, received the title of Emperor together 
with the 'Middle Kingdom', consisting of Austrasia, eastern Burgundy, 
Provence, and Italy. Lewis the German received the bulk of the eastern, solidly 
Germanic sector (see Map 12). The Treaty of Verdun created the core of both the 
future Germany and the future France. The 'Middle Kingdom' was left a bone of 
eternal contention between them. Charlemagne's ultimate legacy was not just the 
example of fragile unity but, equally, the prospect of unending strife, [kral] 

The feuding of the Carolingians or 'Karlings' created an opportunity which 




the Vikings were quick to exploit. The summer of 841 saw them sailing up the 
Seine to plunder Rouen. In 843-4, following the Treaty of Verdun, they wintered 
on the island of Noirmoutier. In 854 the new city of Hamburg was burned, and 
Paris was sacked while Charles the Bald took refuge on Montmartre. In 847 the 
ancient city of Bordeaux was taken hostage for years. In 852 an ominous 
precedent was set when Charles the Bald, having trapped the Viking host in their 
camp at Jeufosse near the Seine estuary, paid them off with gold and permanent 
grants of land. He was rewarded by repeated raids which Orleans alone was able 
to resist. 


KRAL 

Charlemagne ravaged the Slavs on at least four fronts. He reduced the 
Abotrites and Sorbs, to the east of the Elbe, in 789. He forced the Czechs of 
Bohemia to pay tribute in 805-6, and the Carinthian Slavs of the Sava and 
Drava likewise. In respect for the great conqueror, the Slavs adopted his 
name as their word for 'king'. Karol has become krai in Czech, krol in 
Polish, korol ' in Russian. The Franks gave the Slavs their first model of 
Christian kingship. (Krai even means 'king' in Turkish.) 

In the West, Charlemagne was adopted as the presiding monarch of 
numerous medieval legends, the supreme hero of the chansons de geste. 
Already in the ninth century, a monk of St Gall composed a largely fabulous 
chronicle, De Gestis Karoli Magni. Soon Charlemagne was to be portrayed 
by the troubadours as the ubiquitous champion of Christendom, swinging his 
sacred sword 'Joyeuse', smiting the infidel, riding at the head of his 
companions-Roland, Ganelon, Naimes of Bavaria, Ogier the Dane, 
Guillaume of Toulouse, Turpin the battling Archbishop of Reims. 

In the French tradition the Twelve peers' of Charlemagne consisted of 
the three Dukes of Normandy, Burgundy, and Aquitaine, the three Counts of 
Champagne, Toulouse, and Flanders, and the six spiritual peers, the Bishops 
of Reims, Faon, Chalons, Beauvais, Fangres, and Noyon. 

In the German legends Charlemagne was often said to be sleeping, 
waiting for the call to wake and save his beloved subjects from their ills. In 




the Bavarian tale he is seated on a chair in the Untersberg, as on his throne in 
the chapel at Aachen. The end of the world will be nigh when his beard has 
grown thrice round the table before him. In the German language, 
Charlemagne's name has been given to the constellation of the Great Bear- 
the Karlswagen. In Old English, the 'Charles Wain' was an alternative name 
for the constellation of the Plough. 

Later, both in France and Germany, Charles the Great was hailed as the 
progenitor of the nation's royalty. For the French 'Charlemagne', for the 
Germans 'Karl der Grosse', he was seen not as a Frank but as a patriotic 
French or German leader. His example was invoked at Napoleon's imperial 
coronation in 1804. His portrait occupies the first place in the gallery of the 
German emperors painted in 1838-52 in the Kaisersaal at Frankfurt. 2 

In the twentieth century, Charles the Great has been more regarded as a 
symbol of Franco-German reconciliation. In 1943, when the Nazis formed a 
new division of French volunteers for the Waffen SS, or in 1955 when the 
Council of Europe funded a Prize 'for services to the cause of European 
unity', the organizers appealed to the same name-to 'Charlemagne'. 


In 864, by the Edict of Pitres, Charles the Bald at last gave orders for all 
localities to build fortifications, and for a task force of cavalry to be on hand. But 
relief was still far off. Year after year the internecine wars of the Carolingians 
were studded with royal deaths, with temporary partitions, and with Viking raids 
of ever greater insolence. From 867 to 878 the Danes were preoccupied in 
England. In 880 they ravaged the valley of the Elbe. In 885-6,40,000 Vikings 
poured out of 700 longships drawn up on the present-day Champ de Mars, and 
laid siege to Paris for eleven months. Count Odo conducted a heroic defence, 
only to find that the Emperor, Charles the Fat, had paid off the Vikings with 700 
lb of silver and packed them off into Burgundy. 

In the British Isles, which had escaped the attentions of Charlemagne, the 
impact of the Vikings was particularly severe. The Danish invasions created 
divisions which persisted for 200 years. Egbert, King of Wessex, had been 
recognized as Bretwalda or overlord of Britain in 828. Within a generation, 
however, the Danes were challenging the supremacy of Wessex. Alfred the 
Great, King of Wessex (r. 849-99), spent a lifetime containing them. At one 
point, in 878, he was forced to hide in the marshes of Athelney in Somerset. But 




battles in that same year enabled him to partition the country. The Treaty of 
Wedmore created the Danelaw -a vast area subject to Danish rule. From then 
on, until the fateful year of 1066, England was to be disputed by the English 
house of Wessex and the Danes. In the tenth century, after the expulsion of Eric 
Bloodaxe, the last Danish king of York, Viking raids were resumed with a 
vengeance. In 994 London was beset by a combined force of Danes and 
Norwegians. From 1017-35 Knut, or Canute, ruled over a vast North Sea empire 
linking England with Scandinavia. The old Anglo-Saxon kingdom enjoyed a 
brief respite under Edward the Confessor (r. 1042-66), founder of Westminster 
Abbey. Edward's death in 1066 prompted a war between three rival claimants- 
Harold Hardrada of Norway, Harold Godwinson of Wessex, and William the 
Bastard, Duke of Normandy. 

Whilst the English battled the Danes, the rest of the British Isles witnessed a 
long, complex struggle between Vikings and Celts. Fluctuating federations of 
Northmen fought fluctuating leagues of Celtic princes. In Ireland, the Celts held 
the interior against fortified Viking settlements on the coast. After a century of 
mayhem, they finally gained the upper hand under the much-sung Bhriain 
Boroimhe (Brian Bora, r. 1002-14), who left the kingdom to be disputed 
between the O'Brians, the O'Neills, and the O'Connors. There followed an era 
when the Irish again ruled the whole of Ireland unchallenged for 150 years. An 
Ard Rih or 'High King' of Erin held authority over the lesser kings of the 'Fifths' 
of Meath, Munster, Leinster, Ulster, and Connaught; the ancient Brehon Laws, 
which had originated in prehistoric times, were written down to provide a firm 
framework of administrative practice and social custom; and the traditional life 
of the fine or 'clans' held sway under its assemblies, its judges, and the growing 
influence of an increasingly institutionalized Church. In Wales, the Celtic 
principalities were trapped between Vikings on the coasts and unrelenting 
English pressure on the inland borders. From the eighth century onwards they 
were held behind the great Dyke built by Offa, King of Mercia, and were largely 
cut off from their kinsmen in Strathclyde and Cornwall. They found champions 
and temporary overlords in the much-sung Rhodri Mawr (Roderick the Great, d. 
877) and Grufrydd ap Llywelyn (Griffith, d. 1063). [llanfair] 

In the north of Britain the Gaelic King of Kintyre, Kenneth MacAlpin (d. 
c.860) was the first to join Piets with Scots, and thereby to launch the concept of 
a united 'Scotland'. After that, a three-sided contest emerged between the Gaels 
of the highlands, the English of the lowlands, and the Norsemen of the outer 
isles. It was in 1040 that Macbeth, Lord of Moray, who is said to have made a 



pilgrimage to Rome, determined to murder Duncan, King of the Scots: 

To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow, 

Creeps in this petty pace from day to day 
To the last syllable of recorded time, 

And all our yesterdays have lighted fools 
The way to dusty death. Out, out brief candle! 

Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player 
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage 
And then is heard no more; it is a tale 
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, 

Signifying nothing. 5 

The history of Britain's Celts was recorded by their bards, and by chroniclers 
such as Marianus Scotus (c. 1028-83). It was of little interest to the English, like 
William Shakespeare, until a much later date. 

In the midst of the chaos, five Frankish kingdoms were steadily drifting 
apart, as each was left to fend for itself. In Neustria, royal authority declined to 
the point where hereditary fiefs began to emerge in each of the main counties- 
in Toulouse (862), in Flanders (862), in Poitou (867), in Anjou (870), in 
Gascony, Burgundy, and Auvergne. These were the kernels of the later French 
provinces. In 911 Charles the Simple, King of France, lifted the Viking threat by 
signing the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte with the veteran sea-king Hrolfe or 
Rollo. The origins of 'Normandy' seem to have lain in a French version of the 
Danelagh in England. In the eastern kingdom, Arnulf of Carinthia cleared 
Germany of Norsemen, but only by importing the Magyars. A kingdom of upper 
Burgundy had crystallized round the court of Count Rudolf at St 
Maurice/Moritz, and a kingdom of lower Burgundy under Count Boso at Arles. 
In Italy, where Moorish 'saracens' from Sicily played Vikings, successive 
invasions by the Byzantines in 874-95, the Neustrians in 877, and the 
Austrasians in 894-6 left all political authority in shreds. By 900 Count 
Berengar of Friuli was left in sole possession through a process of sanguinary 
elimination. Western historians have often described those final decades of the 
ninth century as the 'darkest hour' of the Dark Ages. 


LLANFAIR 




Apart from being wonderfully expressive, the place names of medieval 
Wales provide a point of entry into the study of historical developments, 
such as land settlement, which took place before the era of documentary 
records. They are informative as well as curious. 

In the centuries prior to the English conquest (see p. 408), the land in 
Wales was subject to the competing jurisdictions of the native princes, of the 
Anglo-Norman marcher lords, and of the ecclesiastical hierarchy. The 
princes, who were entirely Welsh by culture, ruled over the five 
principalities of Gwynedd, Powys, Deheubarth, Morganwg, and Gwent. The 
marcher lords, with a mixture of English and French connections, dominated 
the east and the south. The bishops, who were educated in Church Latin, 
were based on the four dioceses of Bangor, St Asaph, St David's, and 
Llandaff. By analysing the interplay of Welsh and non-Welsh names with the 
intersection of secular and ecclesiastical authority, historians can build up a 
picture of how, when, by whom, and for what purposes settlements were 
founded or extended. 1 

Some places in Wales, for example, have names which only exist in the 
Welsh form and which are clearly ecclesiastical in origin. The commonest of 
them all is Llanfair, meaning 'St Mary's'. Others in this category would be 
Betws-y-Coed (Chapel in the Wood) or Eglwys Fair (St Mary's Church). 
More common are place-names which are obviously ecclesiastical in origin 
but which have bilingual forms. Such are Llanbedr/Lampeter (St Peter's), 
Caergybi/Holyhead in Anglesey, or Llanbedr Fynydd/Peterston- super- 
Montem in Glamorgan. Then there are the places with bilingual names of 
secular origin. Such are Abertewe/Swansea, Cas Gwent/ Chepstow, and Y 
Gelli Gandryll/Hay-on-Wye in Brecknockshire. Modern 'Hay' derives from 
the medieval Norman La Haie Taillee (Clipped Hedge). 

The final category comprises bilingual forms with mixed ecclesiastical 
and secular associations. This would include Llanfihangel Troddi/ Mitchell 
Troy in Monmouthshire and Llansanffraid-ar-Ogwr/St Bride's Minor in 
Glamorgan. 

The most famous of Welsh place names, however, has no medieval 
origins. When the London-Holyhead railway was opened in 1850, the first 
station on the Anglesey side of the Menai straits was at the village of 
Llanfair. Seeking fame and tourists, the station-master decided to improve its 



name, concocting an 'ancient' Welsh circumlocution which made the 
station's nameboard longer than the station's platform. What the British Post 
Office calls Llanfair P. G. 'Jones the Station' called Llanfairpwllgwyngyll- 
gogerychwerndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch. Tourists are told that it stands for 
'St Mary's in a hollow of white hazel near to a rapid whirlpool and to St 
Tysilio's Church by the red cave'. 2 


In those Western lands, disorder begat feudalism. One cannot easily distinguish 
causes from effects; but the fragmentation of political authority and the defence¬ 
lessness of the localities encouraged a series of political, legal, social, economic, 
and military developments which together form what later theoreticians have 
called 'the feudal regime'. In reality, feudalism was not a uniform system: 
problems of definition and variation abound. One of the most influential modern 
summaries of the subject had to be called Qu'est-ce que lafeodalite?: 

Feudalism, in the technical sense, may be regarded as a body of institutions creating and regulating the 
obligations of obedience and service ... on the part of one free man (the vassal) towards another free man 
(the lord), and the obligations of protection and maintenance on the part of the lord with regard to his 
vassal . 6 

The key elements were heavy cavalry, vassalage, enfeoffment, immunity, private 
castles, and chivalry. 

Heavy cavalry, of a sort which demanded over-sized cataphracts or 'great 
horses' to carry armoured knights, came to the West from Persia and Byzantium. 
Charles Martel has been credited not only with their introduction but also with 
secularizing large amounts of Church land to support their upkeep. For this 
reason he has been called 'the founder of European feudalism'.- The stirrup was 
invented about the same time. By helping the horseman to stand firmly on his 
mount, and to carry a lance backed by the full momentum of horse and rider, the 
stirrup changed cavalry warfare from light, mobile skirmishing into heavyweight 
offence.- The main problem, therefore, was to provide a social framework 
wherein a sizeable class of knights could permanently support both the 
psychological demands of their service and training and the enormous costs of 
their horses, their equipment, and their retinue. The upkeep of the knightly class 
- cabalarii, chevaliers, Rittern, szlachta -where landowning and the cavalry 
tradition went hand in hand, provided the central rationale of feudal society. 





Vassalage grew out of the late Roman practice of commendatio, 
'commendation', where a patron would seal an offer of protection by clasping 
the hands of his clients. In Carolingian times the lord began to be tied to his 
vassals or 'subordinates' by an oath of fealty, and by the act of homage sealed 
with a kiss. The two men embraced; the vassal knelt, and was invested with the 
symbols of his new status-a banner, a lance, a charter of agreement, a clod of 
earth. Thereafter they were bound for life in a mutual contract of reciprocal 
duties and obligations. The vassal was sworn to serve, the lord to protect and to 
maintain: 

Berars de Monsdidier devant Karle est venuz; 

Ases piez s'agenouille, s'est ses horn devenuz; 

L'ampereres le baise, si l'a releve suz; 

Par une blanche anisagne, li est ses fiez renduz. 

(Berard of Montdidier came before Charlemagne, knelt at his feet, and became 
his man. The Emperor kissed him, when he had raised him up; and gave him his 
word by means of a white banner.) 2 

The feodum or 'fief', whence feudalism takes its name, grew out of the 
earlier practice of beneficium or 'benefit', where a patron would make a gift of 
land in vague expectation of some future advantage. In Carolingian times, such 
land grants began to be made explicitly as the 'fee' for military service. In due 
course the feudal tariff was refined and extended. It was originally calculated in 
terms of knight-service, that is, the number of knights to be provided in return 
for a given area of land. But it was stretched to include castle-guard and escort 
duties, judicial service in the lord's court, consilium or 'advice' rendered in the 
lord's council, and various forms of auxilium or 'assistance'. The lords came to 
interpret assistance in the sense of financial 'reliefs', including a downpayment 
equivalent to one year's income plus the 'aids in four kinds' which were payable 
for the lord's ransom, for the knighting of his eldest son, for the dowry of his 
eldest daughter, and for crusade. They also reserved their rights of custodia 
(wardship of minors), of gite (lodging), of marriage (permission to marry), and 
of retrait (buying out the contract). But in exchange for the dues the vassal or 
'tenant' received both the income of the land and the jurisdiction over all its 
inhabitants. In the case of default, the land and its income reverted to the owner. 

In principle the fief was indivisible and inalienable. The contract 
automatically lapsed on the death of either party-in German Manfall or 


Herrenfall. In practice vassals went to great lengths to secure the succession of 
their relations and the right to divide or dispose of the land. For their part, lords 
took elaborate precautions to control the succession of women, of minors, or of 
incompetents. Special terms and eccentric clauses abounded. The chief vassals 
of the bishop of Paris were contracted to carry the bishop on their shoulders 
during his consecration. Certain fiefs in Kent were held on condition that their 
tenant 'held the king's head in the boat' during Channel crossings. The 
opportunities for financial extortion were enormous. When Ferrand of Portugal 
contracted with the King of France for the fief of Flanders in 1212, he paid a 
'relief' of £50,000 for permission to marry the heiress. 

Not surprisingly, legal wrangles were endemic. It was usual practice at an 
early date for all sovereign territories to create a separate code of feudal law, the 
Lehnrecht, and a separate system of courts, the Lehnsgericht, for trying feudal 
disputes. The prince customarily acted as court president, his chief vassals as 
assessors. Feudalism is generally judged to have come into operation when the 
practice of enfeoffment, or infeudation, became hereditary, and when it was 
merged with vassalage into one coherent whole. 'It was the indissoluble union 
between the position of a vassal and the possession of a fief that constituted the 
feudal system.'- In the last resort, however, vassalage and enfeoffment were 
incompatible. As vassals, the members of a knightly family were sworn to 
pursue the interests of their lord. As possessors of a fief, they were driven to 
pursue their own interests. Hence the characteristic tensions, and treacheries, of 
feudal society. 

Feudal society consisted of a dense network of contractual relationships 
which linked the highest to the lowest in the realm. At the highest level, 
enfeoffment involved a contract between the sovereign and his 'tenants-in- 
chief', that is, with the barons holding the principal provinces of the kingdom. 
But through 'sub-infeudation' the tenants-in-chief could enfeoff tenants of their 
own; and subtenants could then enfeoff further tenants; and so on, right down the 
line. Most men who were vassals in relation to their 'superiors' acted as lords in 
relation to their 'inferiors'. 

Feudal contracts were recorded for posterity in charters and indentures, 
though few from the early period survive: 

In the name of the Trinity ... Amen. I, Louis, by the Grace of God King of the French, hereby make known 
to all present and those to come that in our presence Count Fienry of Champagne conceded the fief of 
Savigny to Bartholomew, Bishop of Beauvais, and to his successors. And for that fief, the said bishop has 


made promise and engagement for one knight, and justice and service to Count Henry ... and has agreed 
that bishops to come will do likewise. Done at Mantes, in the year of the Incarnate Word li67... and given 
by the hand of Hugh, the chancellor.- 

At the local level, the fiefs of princes and barons were reflected in the 
arrangements of manorial estates. In this case, the lord of the manor granted a 
plot of land to each of his serf families in exchange for service in the form of 
unpaid labour on his demesne. Enserfment, being a bargain between free and 
unfree, lacked many of the reciprocities of enfeoftment. But in so far that it 
implied a contract trading land for service, and protection for loyalty, it was 
based on similar principles. It was not to be confused with common slavery. In 
some parts of Europe-in northern Italy, for instance-serfs swore an oath of 
loyalty to their master, like knights to their liege-lord. 

Given this network of contractual relationships, feudal society became 
extremely hierarchical. The Treaty of Verdun in 843 had stated the principle that 
'every man should have a lord'. In theory at least, the only persons to possess 
absolute independence were the Pope and the Emperor, and they were vassals of 
God. Attempts to describe this state of affairs have led to concepts such as the 
'feudal ladder' or the 'feudal pyramid', where the ruler of a country sits gaily 
atop neat layers of tenants and subtenants and subsubtenants ... right down to 
the serfs at the bottom. Such models mislead by their artificial neatness and 
symmetry. In reality, feudal society was built on a confused mass of conflicting 
dependencies and loyalties, riddled with exceptions and exemptions, where the 
once clear lines of service were fouled up by generations of contested privileges, 
disputed rights, and half-forgotten obligations. It was certainly hierarchical, but 
it was anything but neat and regular. 

The extent of the survival of allodium, 'freehold land', was also very uneven. 
In some regions, such as the future Switzerland, freehold was common; in 
others, such as northern France, it virtually disappeared. Most usually there was 
a terrible tangle of feudal and freehold estates, and of families holding part of 
their land in fief and part in full ownership. To the feudal mind freehold was an 
aberration. It was sometimes called feodum solis, a 'fief of the sun.' 
Psychologically, however, the consequences were simple. Almost everyone was 
conditioned by their position in the social order, hemmed in by their legal and 
emotional ties of dependence. Those ties gave them a measure of security, and an 
unquestioned framework of identity, but they also made individuals vulnerable to 
exploitation, repression, and involuntary ignorance. 'What characterizes 
mediaeval in contrast to modern society is its lack of individual freedom.'- 



One might also presume that a feeling of powerlessness over their personal 
lives added to medieval people's preoccupation with religion-in particular to 
their strong belief in the afterlife, and to their morbid cult of death. 

Immunitas or immunity concerned the granting of exemptions from taxes, or 
from other impositions due to the central authority. In the early days the Church 
was the chief beneficiary, but immunities of various sorts were gradually granted 
to a wide variety of individuals, institutions, and corporations. They stemmed 
from a recognition that rulers could no longer cope with all their responsibilities; 
and they fostered the fragmentation of political, jurisdictional, and economic 
authority. The result was a patchwork of authorities where each locality was 
governed not by any uniform obligations but by the specific terms of the charters 
and 'liberties' granted to the particular abbeys, districts, or cities. Particularism 
was a hallmark of the feudal order. 

Stone castles, together with heavy cavalry, were one of the factors which 
eventually contained the damage inflicted by Viking, Saracen, and Magyar 
raiders. An impregnable fortress, perched on crag or coast, provided the 
inhabitants of the district with a place of refuge, and dominated the land over 
which its garrison could sally forth. Castle-building began in the ninth and tenth 
centuries, when royal and princely authority had reached its lowest ebb; and 
castles, once built, could be used to defy the king or prince long after the raiders 
had departed. In this way private castles became the bastions of local and feudal 
power, permanent obstacles to the resurgence of a centralized state. Many 
centuries later, when statesmen such as Cardinal Richelieu set out to break the 
feudal nobility, their first task lay in the razing of castles, [mir] 

Chivalry, which derives from chevalerie, 'knightly class', refers in its 
narrowest sense to the 'code of honour' by which every knight was bound. It 
encompasses moral values such as honesty, loyalty, modesty, gallantry, fortitude. 
It commanded the knight to protect the Church, to succour the weak, to respect 
women, to love his country, to obey his lord, to fight the infidel, to uphold truth 
and justice, and to keep his word. By extension, chivalry referred to all the 
customs and practices associated with knighthood-and hence to their titles, 
orders, ceremonies, heraldry, vocabulary. In its widest sense, however, it refers 
to the prevailing ethos of feudal society as a whole, which was so completely 
dominated by the knights and all they stood for. With Christianity, it is one of the 
twin pillars of 'the medieval mind'. 

Although many elements of nascent feudalism were present in Carolingian 



times, their full fusion into a coherent social order did not really begin until later. 
The 'classic age of feudalism' is generally located in the tenth to thirteenth 
centuries. The leading scholar of the subject distinguishes two feudal ages-the 
first from the ninth to the mid-eleventh centuries, where small-scale, caste-based 
arrangements prevailed between warlords and peasants, and a 'second feudal 
age', from the mid-eleventh to the mid-thirteenth century, which saw the 
flowering of feudal culture and the growth of hereditary nobility.- Chivalry, in 
particular, was slow to emerge: its attitudes were not fully manifest until the era 
of the twelfth-century renaissance (see pp. 348-50). 

Feudalism, rooted in the Carolingian debacle, remained essentially a Western 
phenomenon. The Byzantine Empire made provision for hereditary land grants 
to soldiers; and the system of pomest'ye in early eastern Slavdom seems to have 
involved similar practices. But the state feudalism of the East, if that is what it 
was, lacked many of the basic ingredients. As far as the countries of central 
Europe are concerned, historians strongly disagree over the importance of feudal 
institutions. Marxists assume that feudalism had to be the basis for the social 
order; others, on the whole, argue that it did not.- Everything depends on what 
definition of feudalism is used. 

Feudalism deeply affected the life of the Church. It greatly weakened central 
ecclesiastical authority. It gave great power to local potentates, and put the 
clergy at their mercy. Counts and princes became accustomed to making and 
unmaking bishops at will. Lesser feudatories controlled the lesser clerics. 
'Bishops were in danger of becoming barons in mitres; kings looked on prelates 
as officials bound to do them service; and patrons sold [church] benefices to the 
highest bidder.'- Not even the Papacy was exempt. With limited means of their 
own, the Popes stood to become puppets either of Roman noblemen, of Italian 
princes, or, at a later stage, of a reviving Empire. 

Thanks to the Benedictine monastery at Cluny in Burgundy, Western 
monasticism adapted itself to the changing circumstances. Isolated abbeys and 
hermitages had been specially vulnerable to both raiders and to local barons. 
They felt a strong need for a collective effort to strengthen their position. 
Founded in 910 by Guillaume le Pieux, Count of Auvergne, Cluny was the 
source of reforms which answered that need. The Cluniacs modified the 
Benedictine rule to include stricter observances and services of inhuman length. 
More importantly, they raised their abbot to a position of strict authority over all 
the daughter houses which they founded or co-opted. In effect, they established 


the first monastic order. Their iron discipline and their independence from local 
concerns gave them a strong voice in Church politics. Above all, having secured 
the popes' support for their reforms, they became the unwavering advocates of 
papal supremacy. Between 910 and 1157 seven long-lived Abbots of Cluny- 
Berno, Odo, Aymard, Majolus, Odilo, St Hugh, and Peter the Venerable- 
created a network of 314 monasteries from Spain to Poland. It was no accident 
that the principal architect of the 'papal monarchy', Urban II, was himself a 
Cluniac (see below). 

Feudalism left a profound legacy in Western culture. It moulded speech and 
manners; it conditioned attitudes to property, to the rule of law, and to relations 
between the state and the individual. By its emphasis on contract, and on the 
balance between rights and obligations, it generated lasting concern for mutual 
trust and for keeping one's word. These attitudes held implications far beyond 
the narrow spheres of military service and land-holding. 

The military dispositions of the feudal order were put to the test when the 
fearsome Magyars rode onto the stage at the end of the ninth century (see p. 
296). Though not related to the Huns, the Magyars lived by the same predatory 
habits, and settled on the same plains of 'Hungaria'. For sixty years, from 895 to 
955, their annual raiding-parties stormed through the former Carolingian empire. 
They were every bit as murderous as the Vikings, and far fleeter. They were 
masters of blackmail, exacting vast sums in tribute or in ransom. In 899 they 
shattered the host of Italy on the River Brenta. In 904 they overwhelmed 
Moravia, in 907 Bavaria, in 922 Saxony. By the 940s they felt free to roam at 
will-to Apulia, to Aragon, to Aquitaine. They finally met their match when the 
princes and nobles of Germany united to challenge the latest invasion of Bavaria 
in 955. There, on the Lechfeld near Augsburg on 10-12 August, Otto of Saxony 
led the Germans to a famous victory in three days of slaughter. The Magyars 
were tamed. The remnants straggled back, and turned to the arts of tending their 
herds and ploughing the plain, [buda] 

For some reason it has been the fashion among some historians to minimize 
the impact of the Magyars, who 'were not a creative factor in the West'.- (All 
this means is that the Magyars did not reach Cambridge.) They were, indeed, a 
destructive force. But they furnished the stimulus for developments of profound 
importance. By destroying Greater Moravia (see p. 321), they recast the ethnic 
and political patterns of the Danube basin, and determined the future profile of 


all Central Europe. Their presence was a vital element in the formation not only 
of Hungary but of Bohemia, of Poland, of Croatia and Serbia, of Austria, and of 
the German Empire. They created the living barrier which separated the Slavs of 
the north from the Slavs of the south. They opened the way for German colonists 
to move down the Danube, and to consolidate their hold on 'Austria'. They 
drove the princes of Germany to unite, and to accept the victor of the Lechfeld as 
their emperor. One account relates how the German troops raised Otto of Saxony 
on their shields at the end of the battle, and acclaimed him emperor on the spot. 
This may not have been the Magyars' intention. But for seven tribes of refugee 
nomads to have crossed the Carpathians, and within one lifetime to have 
provoked the rise of six or seven durable fixtures on the map of Europe, was no 
mean achievement. Only armchair historians, sitting in a backwater of an 
offshore island, might judge such developments trivial. 

Of course, the elevation of Otto I of Saxony (r. 936-73), who was formally 
crowned Emperor in Rome in 962, cannot be attributed exclusively to his victory 
on the Lechfeld. His father, Henry the Fowler (r. 919-36), had already turned 
Saxony into a formidable power. From his palace at Mamleben in the Harz 
mountains he had initiated the eastern Marches, building walled towns and 
planting German settlers against the incursions of Danes, Slavs, and Magyars. 
Quedlinburg, Meissen, and Merseburg all date from that reign. So Otto was 
building on firm foundations. The Marches were consolidated with ecclesiastical 
help. The archbishopric of Magdeburg (968), the bishoprics of Brandenburg and 
Havelberg, and the new port of Hamburg could now be safely planted. Three 
campaigns in Italy, in 951-2, 961-5, and 966-72, ensured that the imperial link 
between Germany and Italy was restored. A series of civil wars, and of judicious 
matrimonial alliances, saw the wayward duchies of Franconia, Lotharingia, 
Swabia, and Bavaria reintegrated. 

Henceforth the restored Empire was destined to have a continuous existence 
until its destruction by Napoleon. The leadership of the house of Saxony 
naturally turned its centre of gravity to the east, although its economic life was 
still dominated by the Rhineland. Its kingmaking capital stayed in Aachen; and 
its possession of Lotharingia, the old 'Middle Kingdom', gave it a permanent 
stake in western affairs. The Salian dynasty which followed the Saxons from 
1024 to 1125 were of Frankish origin. But they no longer ruled the empire of the 
Franks. They ruled a creature which would grow into the Holy Roman Empire of 
the German Nation-the launch-pad of 'Germany' (see Appendix III, p. 1246). 



In 972, at the end of his last campaign in Italy, Otto I took a momentous step. 
Having conquered the Byzantines' Italian territories, he offered to return them in 
exchange for the mutual recognition of titles. He was to defer to the 'Empire of 
the Romans' if they would recognize his own, equal, imperial status. The 
agreement was sealed by the marriage of Otto's son to Theophano, daughter of 
the previous Byzantine Emperor, Romanus II. From then on, there were to be 
two empires. The dream of one universal empire was lost forever. True enough, 
Theophano's son, Otto III (r. 983-1002), did entertain visions of a wider realm. 
He made a pilgrimage to Aachen to open Charlemagne's tomb, and he paid an 
official visit to his eastern Polish neighbours. But his ideas attracted support 
neither in Germany nor in Constantinople, and he left no heirs. His successor, 
Henry II (r. 1002-24), the last of the Saxon line, was soon grappling with all the 
problems which became the Empire's normal burden: civil wars in Germany, 
frontier wars against the Slavs, expeditions into Italy, sporadic conflict with 
France. 

Otto I had viewed the Papacy with autocratic disdain. He ordered that no 
pope should be consecrated before swearing allegiance to the Empire. Having 
hanged the tribunes and Prefect of Rome, he imposed John XIII (965-72) as a 
prelude to his own coronation. For the time being, the Latin Pope was scarcely 
more independent than the Greek Patriarch. Generally speaking, the Saxon 
emperors left the feuding rulers of 'West Francia' to their own devices. In the 
tenth century, the heirs of the Carolingians were locked in a complicated struggle 
of rivalry and mutual dependence with the descendants of Robert, Count of 
Paris, notably with Hugues le Grand, 'Duke of the French', a habitual 
kingmaker. In the process they lost their stake in Lotharingia, and hence of the 
old Frankish heartland. In 987, when the last Carolingian king died without heir, 
the struggle was resolved in favour of the Duke's son, Hugues Capet (r. 987-96) 
-founder of a dynasty that would reign for nearly 400 years. 

Henceforth the kingdom of France was destined to have a continuous 
existence. The leadership of the house of Capet inevitably turned the centre of 
gravity to the West. Of course, the memory of Charlemagne, and the claims to 
Lotharingia remained; but the kingdom had lost its essentially Frankish 
character. Contrary to later assertions, it was not involved in ceaseless warfare 
with its German neighbours; but its definitive separation from the reconstituted 
Empire acted as a powerful motor for a new identity. It was the launch-pad of the 
French nation. 



In the period when the Frankish empire waned and the Saxon empire waxed 
strong, the Byzantine Empire reached its zenith under the Macedonian dynasty. 
Basil I (r. 867-86), an ex-horsebreaker who took the throne through murder, 
proved to be an able administrator who initiated 'an age of recovery and 
consolidation'. The long reigns of his successors, Leo VI the Wise (r. 886-912) 
and Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (r. 913-59), both of them scholars, 
coincided with a marked upsurge in Constantinople's commercial prosperity. 
The warrior emperors, John Tzimisces (r. 969-76) and Basil II Bulgaroctone (r. 
976-1025), 'the Bulgar-slayer', took the offensive on all fronts. The Empress 
Zoe (c.978-1050) maintained power for half a century through the manipulation 
of three imperial husbands. Her portrait in mosaic has survived in Hagia Sophia, 
flanked on one side by Christ and on the other by an emperor whose inscription 
has been suitably obliterated. Her scheming sister Theodora (r. 1055-6) briefly 
emerged as sole ruler, [athos] 

Under the Macedonians, the Byzantine state was able to assert itself both 
internally and externally. The Patriarchs were kept in abject subservience. The 
imperial court presided over a bureaucracy which introduced uniform practices 
throughout the provinces. The army was reorganized with professional, 
knightlike cadres. The aristocratic clans were wedded to state service. The state 
regulated trade and prices whilst maximizing its own income. With a population 
counted in six figures, Constantinople served as the leading entrepot between 
East and West, by far exceeding all other European cities of the age. 
Byzantium's territorial power was greatly reinforced. Basil I re-established the 
Byzantine presence in southern Italy with the recapture of Taranto (880). There 
were two exarchates, in Calabria and in Langobardia, and a Catapenatus at Bari. 
In the East, annual campaigns throughout the tenth century were rewarded with 
the recovery of Syria, Cyprus, Crete, Cilicia, part of Mesopotamia. The Arab 
advance was checked. Armenia, which in the ninth century had been ruled by the 
native Bagratid dynasty, was returned to Byzantine vassalage. The Bulgars, who 
in 924 laid siege to Constantinople, spread their hegemony to the west, but were 
gradually tamed by baptism and the sword. 

Political stability set the stage for a cultural renaissance. Basil I and Leo VI, 
a philosopher, codified the imperial decrees of recent centuries. Byzantine 
church architecture acquired harmonious homogeneity. Men of letters crowded 
the court. Photios (c.810-93), Patriarch and professor, revived the study of 
antiquity. Simeon Metaphrastes (d. c.1000) composed the Menologion, the 
standard collection of the lives of the Christian saints. His contemporary, the 



poet John Geometres, wrote hymns, epigrams, and verse with great humanist 
sensitivity. Michael Psellos (c. 1018-81), court philosopher and polymath, 
published a huge range of historical, theological, and literary works. Critics of 
the 'Macedonian Renaissance 5 maintain that its achievement was more 
encyclopedic than creative. 


ATHOS 

In a chrysobull of 885, the Emperor Basil I formally recognized the 'Holy I 
Mountain' of Athos as a territory reserved for monks and hermits. 
Henceforth, all civilians and females (human and non-human) were banned 
from the 360 km 2 of the 'Garden of the Virgin' on the easternmost of the 
three sea-girt promontories of Chalkidikes. The first permanent monastery, 
the Great Laura, was founded in 936. The basic typikon or charter dates from 
972. The peninsula of Mount Athos, which rises to 2,033 m., was to be ruled 
by a protos or primate and by a council of abbots meeting in the central town 
of Karyes. 1 

From the outset, Athonite monasticism had to compromise between the 
communal and the anchorite traditions. Thirteen of the twenty great 
monasteries built between the tenth and the sixteenth centuries were purely 
coenobitic, having all activities in common, whilst seven were idiorhythmic, 
allowing monks to eat and work individually. These include the three oldest 
-the Great Laura, Vatopedi, and the Georgian-founded Iveron. Each of the 
monasteries is linked to a network of outlying farms, chapels, and anchorite 
cells. The ultimate sanctuary of the hermits is to be found in the vertigo- 
defying settlement of Karoulia, at the precipitous end of the peninsula, 
where the warren of individual huts is approached along a maze of cliff 
paths, stone steps, and chain ladders. 

Over the centuries, Athos came under threat from a succession of 
invaders, including Arab pirates, Lakh shepherds, and Catalan raiders. In the 
period of the Latin Empire (1204-61), concerted attempts were made to 
convert the monks to Catholicism-hence their trenchant opposition to all 
later movements for East-West union. After that, they found ready patrons in 




the princes of Serbia, Bulgaria, and Wallachia. When Salonika was captured 
by the Turks in 1430, the monks secured their privileges from the sultan. 

In the eighteenth century, Athos was the centre of an important pan¬ 
orthodox movement linked to the Patriarch of Constantinople. The Academy 
at Vatopedi was a seat of international learning. 

In the nineteenth century, Athos was targeted by St Petersburg as an 
instrument of Russian influence. As many as 5,000 Russian monks took up 
residence, especially in the roussikon of St Panteleimon and in the skete of 
St Andrew. Greek, Serbian, Romanian, and Bulgarian foundations were 
similarly turned into agencies of their respective national churches. Athos 
lost its last great benefactor in the Russian Revolution of 1917. Its present 
constitution was introduced by treaty with Greece in 1926. 

After decades of decay, a fresh influx of monks in the 1980s raised total 
numbers to c. 1,500, fuelling demands for reform. Monasteries were repaired, 
commercial forestry exploited, access roads built, and (male) tourists 
welcomed. Discussions took place about renewed contacts with Rome. A 
monk of Athos published his complaints for an international audience. 2 The 
Athonites are famous factionists and gossips,' an observer commented. 
'After all, it is the heart of what remains of the Byzantine world.' 3 


Secure and confident beyond the disasters which beset the West, Byzantium 
cruised along in style. When Liutprand of Cremona, historian of Otto the Great 
and ambassador of the King of Italy, visited Constantinople in 949 he was 
overwhelmed with amazement. His reception by Constantine Porphyrogenitus 
impressed, and offended, him mightily: 

'In front of the emperor's throne stood a tree of gilded iron, whose branches were filled with birds of 
various kinds, also made of gilded iron, which gave forth a variety of bird-songs. The throne itself was so 
cunningly constructed that at one moment it looked low ... and a moment later had risen to a great height. It 
was guarded on either side by huge lions of gilded metal or wood which lashed their tails on the floor and 
roared aloud with open mouths and moving tongues. 

In this hall, attended by two eunuchs, I was brought before the emperor. At my entrance, the lions 
roared and the birds sang ... But after prostrating myself for the third time, when I raised my head, I beheld 
the emperor, whom I had seen at first seated slightly above me, elevated almost to the roof of the hall and 
clad in different garments. How this was managed, I do not know 


Liutprand's understandable sense of inferiority aptly reflects Western attitudes 





towards the East in this period. 

Byzantium's principal foe was Islam, against which it stood as 
Christendom's front-line bastion. But on its Balkan flank it faced a vigorous 
state that was a major rival for more than two centuries. The first Bulgarian 
Empire emerged from the tribal adventures of Terbel, Krum, and Omartag (see p. 
220) and exercised sway over much of Byzantium's former Danubian provinces. 
Its adoption of Orthodox Christianity (see pp. 321-4) brought it into the world of 
Byzantine civilization, but did not prevent intense conflicts. Under Simeon (r. 
893-927), who styled himself 'Basileus kai Autokrator of the Bulgars and 
Greeks' as well as 'Tsar' (Caesar), Bulgaria sought to assume Byzantium's role 
in the Balkans, but came to grief in 924 before the walls of Constantinople. In 
the tenth century Byzantine forces reconquered the eastern heartland of Bulgaria. 
In this they were helped by the strife surrounding the Bogumil heresy, and by 
their Magyar and Kievan mercenary allies. In 966-7 Svyatoslav of Kiev attacked 
and captured the ancient Bulgarian capital, Preslav, in return for 1,800 pounds of 
Byzantine gold. 

Under Tsar Samuel (r. 976-1014) the Bulgarian empire knew a second lease 
of life. The new capital of Ochrid became the centre of a powerful monastic 
movement, and of an autocephalous Bulgarian Church that survived the 
Byzantine reconquest. The political end came in 1014, following the Byzantine 
victory at Serres in Macedonia. Basil II blinded 14,000 Bulgarian prisoners of 
war before returning them to their Tsar, who promptly died of shame. Byzantium 
was still some way from the great crisis of 1071, when the Normans in Sicily, the 
Seljuks in Asia Minor, and the Pechenegs before the walls of Constantinople 
combined to provoke the onset of irreversible decline, [bogumil] 

In the three centuries after Charlemagne the frontiers of Christendom were 
greatly extended. The countries converted were (in the order of their conversion) 
Moravia, Bulgaria, Bohemia, Poland, Hungary, and Kievan Rus'. In the north, 
the steady advance of the Saxon marches was accompanied by forcible 
Christianization; but it was not until the eleventh century that any major advance 
was made into Scandinavia. Despite considerable friction on the ground, the 
leadership of the Greek and Latin Churches were still apt to view their 
missionary work as the common task of Christendom. 

Moravia-whose name is related to the German Mahren, meaning march- 
lands-lay on the north bank of the Danube to the east of Charlemagne's empire. 



It was the first of the Slav lands to emerge as an organized principality. In the 
seventh century, under one Samo, it is mentioned in Fredegar's chronicle as a 
territory that had rejected the Frankish obedience. In the eighth century it was 
evangelized from Bavaria by (among others) the Irish missionary, Virgil of 
Salzburg. In the ninth century the reigning prince appears to have been baptized 
by a German bishop, and a church was consecrated at Nitra. 

In 862, however, a Moravian approach to the Patriarch of Constantinople 
was answered by a mission led by two Macedonian brothers, Michael and 
Constantine, known respectively as SS Methodius (815-85) and Cyril (826-67). 
Methodius had been governor of one of the Byzantine empire's Slav provinces; 
and Cyril, a diplomat, had travelled in the Muslim lands and in Khazaria. The 
purpose of their invitation to Moravia was apparently to check the oppressive 
influence of German priests, and to enable the country to worship in its own 
idiom. To this end Cyril devised the Glagolitic alphabet and a Slavonic liturgy, 
and translated the Bible. 

After founding the Moravian mission, it is significant that the brothers 
travelled to Rome, where Cyril died. He was interred in the crypt of San 
Clemente. But Methodius returned to exercise his calling as Bishop of Pannonia 
and Moravia. He died in 885, probably at Velehrad near modern Bratislava. 
There was clearly much wrangling in Moravia between Latin and Greek clergy; 
yet Cyril and Methodius, the 'Apostles of the Slavs', enjoyed the patronage both 
of the Roman Pope and of the Byzantine Patriarch, thereby setting a rare, 
ecumenical example. Their names are revered by Czechs, Croats, and Serbs, and 
especially by the Bulgars, among whom the remnants of the mission eventually 
took refuge. Twenty years after the death of Methodius, Moravia was destroyed 
by the Magyars; but the memory of the 'co-patrons of Europe' has lingered on. 

In Bulgaria, the rivalry of the Latin and the Greek Churches was ultimately 
resolved in favour of the Greeks. In the mid-ninth century the ruler of Bulgaria, 


BOGUMIL 


In 975 the Emperor John Tzimisces transplanted a community of Armenian 
heretics to the district of Philipopolis (Plovdiv) in Bulgarian Thrace. They 




were 'Paulicians', remnants of a much larger movement broken by the 
Byzantines some time earlier. At the same time, the Orthodox Church was 
showing concern about the followers of an obscure Bulgarian priest, 
Bogumil, whose errors suspiciously resembled those of the Paulicians. They 
too were dualists, heirs to a tradition that went back to the Gnostics and the 
(non-Christian) Manicheans. Merging together, the two groups were to 
found a faith whose adherents would stretch right across Europe 'from Black 
Sea to Biscay'. 1 

Bogumilstvo or 'Bogumilism' appealed to the downtrodden Slav peasants 
of the Balkans, resentful of Greek or Bulgar overlords. It was to develop in 
two forms, the main, 'Bulgarian' variety and the lesser, 'Dragovitsan' 
variety, so named after a village on the borders of Macedonia, where a 
thoroughgoing dualist doctrine of Paulician origin took root. It was brought 
to Constantinople by a monk called Basil the Bulgar, many of whose 
unrepentant followers were burned at the stake. But it resurfaced in the mid¬ 
twelfth century, when 'false bishops' had to be dismissed and a patriarch 
retired for Bogumil sympathies. 

Bogumil doctrine diverged from Orthodox Christianity on issues derived 
from their views on the origin of evil. The Bogumils rejected the creation 
story of the Old Testament, believing that the world was created by Satan, 
God's elder son. They also rejected Christ's miracles, except as allegorical 
stories, the Sacraments, icons, feast days, and the entire liturgy and ritual of 
Orthodoxy. They specially detested the Cross since it was the instrument of 
Christ's murder. According to one account, they believed that God had 
tempered his wrath by allowing Satan to keep what was already created, and 
that he sent Jesus, his second Son, to cure the resultant ills. Jesus, the 
embodiment of the Word, 'entered the Virgin through her ear, took flesh 
there and emerged by the same door. The Virgin did not notice, but found 
Him as an infant in a Cave in Bethlehem. He lived and taught, and by 
seeming to die, was able to descend into Hell and bind Satan.' 2 

Bogumil practices appeared very strange to contemporaries. Bogumils 
read only selected parts of the Bible, especially the Psalms, the Prophets, the 
Gospels, the Epistles, and Revelation. Their only prayer was 'Our Father', 
which they recited 120 times a day. They practised fasting, discouraged 
marriage, and trained an elite caste of 'the Elect'. One branch, the followers 
of Cyril the Barefoot, practised nudism in an attempt to regain the Garden of 



Eden. Another, following the preacher Theodosius, indulged in orgies, 
deliberately experiencing sin in order to qualify for repentance. In political 
matters, all Bogumils presented a front of passive but obdurate 
nonconformity. 

Though Bogumilism was eradicated in Byzantium and Bulgaria during 
the thirteenth century, it had spread by then to the West (see pp. 361-3), 
and was taking root in fresh parts of the Balkans. In the fourteenth century it 
even penetrated the holy mountain of Athos. But its greatest success was to 
occur in the principalities of Bosnia and Hum (Hercegovina), whose rulers 
chose to propagate the Bogumil faith as an antidote to the pretensions of 
their Hungarian Catholic and Serbian Orthodox neighbours. It was in 1199 
that the Ban of Bosnia and his court first declared themselves 'Patarenes', as 
the Bosnian Bogumils were called; and despite many twists of religious 
fortune, Bosnia remained predominantly Patarene until the Ottoman 
conquest of 1463. At this point the Bosnian nobility converted promptly to 

Islam, thereby avoiding the Catholic and Orthodox trap once again. 
[SARAJEVO] 

Scholars once believed that the Slavs were predisposed to Bogumilism 
through the dualist beliefs of Slav paganism. Hetmold of Liibeck reported in 
the twelfth century that the north German Slavs worshipped a good God and 
a bad God. If so, the phenomenon was purely local. Pagan Slavs were more 
likely to have been affected by Bogumilism than vice versa. The same can 
be said of Balkan folklore. 

Dualists of the Bogumil type attracted many labels. Among them, apart 
from Bogumils, Dragovitsans, and Patarenes, were the Phundaites or 'scrip- 
bearers', Babuni (in Serbia), Runcarii or Runkeler (in Germany), Kudugers 
(in fifteenth-century Macedonia), Poplicani (in northern France), and 
Bougres, Textores or Tisserands or 'weavers', Albigensians, and Cathars in 
Languedoc. 3 

Bogumilism has been called 'a hopeless faith'. If so, its adherents 
showed exceptional perseverance in place of hope. 


Boris X (r. 852-88), was toying with a Frankish alliance; and in 862 he met with 
Louis the German at Tulin on the Danube. But the scheme misfired; and peace 
with Byzantium in 865 caused Boris to accept baptism from the Patriarch of 




Constantinople. Boris, however, continued to intrigue with Rome, and a long 
letter containing 106 questions on Roman practice and theology evoked the 
famous Responsa of Pope Nicholas II. A further Byzantine advance then led to 
the Bulgarian mission of St Clement Slovensky (840-916) and the final drive to 
bring Bulgaria into the Orthodox fold. Clement, a fellow Macedonian, had 
accompanied Cyril and Methodius to Moravia, and was Cyril's principal 
continuator in his work on the Slavonic liturgy. He was probably the true 
systematizer both of the Old Church Slavonic liturgical language and of the 
Cyrillic alphabet. He was the first bishop of the Bulgarian Church, and is buried 
in the monastery of St Pantaleinion at Ochrid. After 893, when pagan opposition 
to Christianity was crushed, the court of Tsar Simeon at Preslav hosted a 
veritable explosion of ecclesiastical learning for which Old Church Slavonic was 
now the vehicle. The auto-cephalous Bulgarian Church had seven sees: Ochrid, 
Pliska, Preska, Nesebar, Sardica (Sofia), Belgrade, and Preslav. 

Bohemia, like Bulgaria, balanced for many years between Latin and Greek 
influences. In the ninth century the loyalties of the princes of Bohemia were 
pulled in two opposite directions-to the Franks and to the Moravians. Borivoj 
(r. 855-91) and his consort Ludmila, founders of the Hradeany chapel on the 
castle hill in Prague, were baptized into the Moravian (Slavonic) rite. Borivoj's 
successor, Spytygner (r. 893-915), was baptized at Regensburg in Bavaria into 
the Latin rite. Vaclav (r. 900-29), better known as St Wenceslas, whose life and 
death are celebrated in equal measure in Latin and in Slavonic sources, reigned 
briefly at the height of the Magyar onslaught. He was murdered by his brother 
Boleslas I (r. 929-67), who was seeking a closer association with Saxony. In due 
course, as a martyr to growing German influence, he became the national saint 
of the Czechs. When the bishopric of Prague was founded in 967, it was 
subordinated to the metropolitan of Mainz, thereby reflecting the power of the 
new Ottoman empire. St Vojtech or Adalbert (956-97) was its second bishop. 

Yet for more than a century, under the protection of the Premyslid dynasty, 
the Slavonic rite survived in Bohemia alongside the Latin one. At the monastery 
of Sazanar in particular a rich school of Slavonic learning flourished, with 
contacts both in Kiev and in Croatia. In 1091, as an act of defiance, King 
Vratislav II submitted himself to a second Slavonic coronation by the last abbot 
of Sazanar. Thereafter, Latinization was virtually complete. Bohemia, a fief of 
the Empire and a client province of the German Church, was the Slav country 
most firmly drawn into the German orbit. 



Poland, Bohemia's eastern neighbour, edged toward Christendom in a 
similarly complex and prolonged process. In the ninth century, when the 
Wiatanie or 'Vistulanian tribe' owed allegiance to Moravia, the earliest Christian 
contacts were made with the mission of Cyril and Methodius. The chief of the 
Vistulanians appears to have accepted baptism in the Slavonic rite in 875; and 
traces of several Christian churches from that period have been discovered. The 
region of the upper Vistula, including Cracow, remained part of Bohemia until 
990, and did not finally sever its connections with the Czech world until 1086. 
Poland's early links with the Slavonic rite have not been emphasized; but it is 
arguable, as in Bohemia, that they persisted into the twelfth century.- 

Most of the tribes to the north, who would form the core of the first Polish 
kingdom, followed a different course. They remained pagan to the middle of the 
tenth century, after which they were drawn directly into the sphere of the Latin 
Church. The fullest description of Slavdom in its final pagan days was composed 
by a Moorish Jew, Ibrahim-Ibn-Jakub, who was sent by the Caliph of Cordova 
on an embassy to central Europe c.965. He visited Prague and possibly Cracow: 


The lands of the Slavs stretch from the Syrian Sea to the Ocean in the north... At present there are four 
kings: the king of the Bui gars; Bojeslav, King of Faraga, Boiema and Karako; Mesko, king of the north; and 
Nakon on the border of the West. 

In general, the Slavs are violent and inclined to aggression. If not for the disharmony among them ... 
no people could match their strength ... They are specially energetic in agriculture ... Their trade on land 
reaches to the Ruthenians and to Constantinople .... 

Their women, when married, do not commit adultery. But a girl when she falls in love with some man 
or other, will go to him and quench her lust. If a husband marries a girl and finds her to be a virgin ... he 
says to her, 'If there were something good in you ... you would certainly have found someone to take your 
virginity.' Then he sends her back. 

The lands of the Slavs are coldest of all. When the nights are moonlit and the days clear, the most 
severe frosts occur ... When people breathe, icicles form on their beards, as if made of glass ... 

They have no bath-houses as such, but ... they build a stone stove on which, when it is heated, they 
pour water. They hold a bunch of grass in their hands and waft the steam around. Then their pores open, and 
all excess matter escapes from their bodies. This hut is called al-istba... 

Their kings travel in great carriages, on four wheels. From the corners of the carriage a cradle is slung 
on chains, so that the passenger is not shaken ... 

The Slavs wage war with the Byzantines, with the Franks and Langobards, and with other peoples .. .- 

Interestingly enough, Ibrahim-Ibn-Jakub did not appear to regard the Rus as 
Slavs, presumably because they were still seen as Norsemen. What is not in 
doubt is that this diplomat from Muslim Spain looked on the exotic peoples of 
the European interior with the curiosity of a modern anthropologist surveying 


the tribes of Papua (see Appendix III, p. 1264). 

In 965, in the same year as Ibrahim-Ibn-Jakub's visit, Mieszko I, prince of 
the Polanie or Polanians, who lived on the River Warta, allied himself with the 
Czechs. As part of the alliance he married the Czech princess Dubravka and 
accepted Christian baptism. He was responding to the rise of the Saxon Empire 
after the defeat of the Magyars, and to pressures for accepting Christianity from 
Germany. The first Latin missionary bishopric was created at Poznan in 
succession to an earlier see of the Slavonic rite, probably at Sandomierz. 
Dependence on the German Empire had been avoided. The ecclesiastical 
province of 'Polonia' was launched some thirty years later, in conjunction with a 
rapidly consolidating Polish state. When the Emperor Otto III visited the newly 
created metropolitan see at Gniezno in ad 1000, and embraced the Polish prince 
as his 'friend and ally', the Wielkopolska (Great Poland) of Mieszko had already 
been joined to the Malopolska (Little Poland) of the south. Benedictine 
monasteries had been established at Mi^dzyrzecz and at Tyniec. Boleslaw 
Chrobry 'the Brave' (r. 992-1025), who stormed Prague in 1003 and notched his 
sword on the Golden Gate of Kiev in 1018, was rewarded by the Pope with 
Poland's first royal crown. In 1037 a great pagan revolt marked the death throes 
of the old order. Thereafter the royal capital moved to Cracow; and the well- 
established Piast dynasty slowly turned Poland into the prime bastion of 
Catholicism in the East. 

Hungary followed very closely in the path of Poland. Its first Christian 
contacts were with Byzantium. A captive Greek monk, Hierothos, was 
consecrated 'Bishop of Turkia' c.950. But the battle of the Lechfeld brought 
German influence in its wake. The Magyar Prince Geza (r. 972-97) was baptized 
with all his family into the Latin rite in 975. Geza's son Istvan (St Stephen, r. 
997-1038) consolidated the imperial link by marrying a Bavarian princess and 
by accepting a royal crown from Rome. Stephen's coronation at the new see of 
Esztergom (Gran) took place in 1001, only one year after Emperor Otto's visit to 
Gniezno. The abbey at Pannonhalma opened in the same year as its sister house 
at Mi^dzyrzecz. [buda] 

All these primitive kingdoms were patrimonial states, where all rights and 
property were held by the ruling prince. The adoption of Christianity, which 
brought in literate clergy, has to be seen as a move to strengthen the infant 
monarchies. 

Kievan Rus' adopted Christianity from Byzantium in 988 as part of a 



comprehensive political settlement. Rus' had been growing closer to Byzantium 
for over a century. Dnieper trade, Varangian raids, and the wars of the steppes 
had established contacts of all sorts. The Prince of Kiev, Volodymyr or Vladimir 
(r. 980-1015), was 'a doughty heathen', a fratricide, and a polygamist. But 
Orthodox baptism, and marriage to Anna, sister of the Emperor Basil II, was the 
necessary price for persuading the Emperor to hire the 6,000 warriors of the 
famous Varangian Guard. Though the Prince's grandmother, St Olha (Olga), had 
been a Christian convert, he had weighed various alternatives before taking the 
same course. Envoys were sent abroad to report on the competing attractions of 
Judaism, Islam, and Christianity. The envoys who reported on their impressions 
from the church of St Sophia in Constantinople carried the day, having been 
treated to the ecclesiastical equivalent of Liutprand's audience with the Emperor. 
Only then did the Kievan Prince receive his christening. He ordered his people to 
the banks of the Dnieper, where they, too, were baptized en masse. He took the 
children of his nobles from their parents, and educated them in the new faith. 
Missionaries were later sent into the country to teach the variant of Orthodoxy 
popularized in Bulgaria by St Clement, together with the Old Church Slavonic 
liturgy, the Cyrillic alphabet, and loyalty to the Patriarch of Constantinople. 
Churches were built, heathen shrines demolished. Christianity reached 
Novgorod, Minsk, and Polotsk in the early eleventh century. Henceforth, Rus' 
was to be an unshakeable member of Christendom. [Novgorod] 

Volodymyr or Vladimir, Prince of Kiev, is frequendy likened to 
Charlemagne, creator of another vast but ephemeral realm.- The parallel is apt 
enough, not least because both men became heroes of later national legends. Of 
course, Volodymyr the Rus was no more a Russian than Charlemagne the Frank 
had been a Frenchman. 'Russia' did not exist in his day, any more than 'France' 
existed in Charlemagne's. Unfortunately, when the Russian Orthodox Church 
came on to the scene five centuries later, it laid monopoly claims to the Kievan 
heritage; and modern Russian propaganda has done everything in its power to 
suppress rival claims and traditions, notably among the Ukrainians. Meanwhile, 
just as Charlemagne was turned into the national hero of the chansons de geste, 
so the saintly 'Prince Vladimir' was turned into the central figure of medieval 
Russian by liny. Roland, Oliver, and Bishop Turpin have their counterparts in 
Alyosha Popovich, Dobryna Nikitich, and the valiant peasant Ilya Popovich- 
the companions of the Krasnoe Solnyshko, 'our beloved little Sunshine'. No one 
would have laughed more rumbustiously at this epithet than the very unsaintly 
saint himself (see Appendix III, p. 1249). 


NOVGOROD 


Ancient Novgorod lay in the centre of the forest zone, and hence was built 
almost entirely from wood-with wooden houses, wooden churches, 
wooden streets, wooden drains, even a wooden, birch-bark writing system. It 
began life as a trading-post on the banks of the River Volkov, at the northern 
end of the Baltic-Black Sea and Caspian-Baltic trade routes. Timber must 
always have been one of its staple commodities. 

When Novgorod was comprehensively excavated in 1951-62, in one of 
the showpieces of medieval archaeology, the science of dendrochronology or 
'tree-ring dating' was presented with one of its major challenges. The 
waterlogged ground had preserved the wooden remains in a remarkable 
state; and in thirteen seasons of excavation the team, led by A. V. 
Artikhovsky and B. A. Kolchin, opened up a site of 9,000 square metres, 
uncovering 1,150 log buildings. Most surprisingly, no fewer than 28 layers 
of wooden street-levels were identified on the former high street, from the 
top level 1 of ad 1462 to the earliest level 28 of 953. On average, the 
roadway had been renewed once every 18 years over 5 centuries, simply by 
laying a new layer of pine logs over the old ones damaged by cart-wheels 
and sledge runners. Extensive coin hoards, two from eighth-century Central 
Asia, showed that Novgorod's far-flung trading contacts had never been 
seriously interrupted, even by the Mongol invasions, [dirham] 

Of 400 birch-bark letters, all but one Finnish specimen were written in 
an early form of Russian. In No. 17, which was found at level 5 (1409-27), 
the bailiff from an estate outside the city writes to his lord: 

Mikhail makes obeisance to his lord, Timothy. The ground is prepared and 
we rhustsow. Come, sir, for everyone is ready, but we cannot have rye 
without your command. 1 

In a fragment of No. 37, found between levels 12 and 13 (1268-99), 
there is a proposal of marriage: 

From Nikita to Ulyanitsa. Marry me. I want you, and you me. And Ignatio 
will act as witness. 2 



Walking the wooden streets of old Novgorod, whose inhabitants were 
slaughtered by the agents of Moscow, some people wonder how the world 
would have changed if Russia could have grown under the leadership of this 
peaceable republic. 3 A Novgorodian Russia would clearly have been very 
different from the Muscovite Russia which triumphed over its rivals. But 
such thoughts x are unhistorical. In any case, medieval archaeology offers no 
clue. 


Scandinavia was not taken into the Christian fold without a struggle. A 
missionary bishopric, directed to the conversion of Scandinavia, had been active 
at Bremen since the 780s. But the Vikings' way of life was not readily 
compatible with the Gospel, and a determined pagan party existed in the court of 
each of the three kingdoms. In Denmark, Harald Bluetooth (r. 940-86) accepted 
Christianity c.960, only to be expelled after founding the bishoprics of Aarhus 
and Schleswig. His son, Swein Forkbeard (r. 985-1014), once the leader of the 
heathen resistance, became the leading christianizer of the Danes. Under Canute 
the Great (r. 1016-35), who ruled England as well as Denmark, Anglo-Saxon 
missionaries set sail for Scandinavia. 

In Norway, too, the drama took place in two acts. One attempt by Olaf 
Tryggvason (r. 995-1000) faltered, whilst the second, by Olaf Haraldson (r. 
1016-28), succeeded through a mixture of bribery, coercion, and zealotry. This 
second Olav, who was killed defending his country against the Danes, was 
buried in the cathedral at Nidaros (Trondheim), and in due course was canonized 
as the national saint. In Sweden, Olaf Skutkonung (r. 995-1022) was baptized in 
1008; but the resultant civil war between Christian and pagan factions continued 
for more than a century. Like St Olaf, St Eric of Sweden (d. 1160), who died in 
battle, and St Canute IV of Denmark (d. 1085), who was assassinated, came to 
be revered as martyrs of the faith. Metropolitan sees were established at 
Trondheim, Uppsala, and Lund in the 1140s by the then Cardinal-Legate, 
Nicholas Breakspeare, destined to be the only English Pope, [eirik] 

The unsaintly character of all the national saint-kings from Wenceslas to Eric 
may well point to the superficiality of the conversions; but it also points to the 
process whereby Christianity was used to foster a sense of community within the 
state. Poland alone of the neophyte nations failed to produce a kingly saint or a 
martyr-king at this stage. Instead, it produced a martyr-bishop. Stanislaw 




Szczepanowski (1030-79), the turbulent Bishop of Cracow, was literally cut to 
pieces in front of the altar by the knights of the king whom he had defied. His 
death, which set an uncanny precedent for the better-known martyrdom of St 
Thomas a Becket in England, indicated the growing power of the Latin Church, 
and the consequent conflicts between Church and State. In later days it was 
taken to symbolize the dismemberment of the sinful Polish kingdom into 
warring feudal fiefs. 

Throughout this long second stage of conversions, the Greek and Latin Churches 
had coexisted in a state of strained separation. There was little co-operation; but 

equally there was no formal divorce. In the mid-eleventh century, however, 
the point of parting was reached. In Constantinople, the Patriarch Michael 
Kerullarios, promoted in 1043, entered into a dispute with the Byzantine 
governor of southern Italy. In the process he closed all the Latin churches in the 
capital, and wrote to the Latin bishops denouncing their schismatic practices, in 
particular their use of unleavened bread in the Eucharist. At the same time the 
Roman Papacy passed for five dramatic years into the assertive hands of Leo IX 
(1049-54), formerly Bruno von Egisheim, Bishop of Toul, and a cousin of the 
German emperor. Pope Leo was driven by a strong belief in his own mission, 
and was no more inclined to brook the pettiness of the Greek Patriarch than to 
tolerate the abuses of the bishops and kings in the West. In January 1054 he 
dispatched a legation to Constantinople under Cardinal Humbert de 
Moyenmoutier, and ordered them to obtain confirmation of his claims to papal 
supremacy. Not surprisingly, disaster ensued. The Patriarch refused to recognize 
the legates' powers and pressed on with the publication of an aggressive 
manifesto, notwithstanding news of Pope Leo's death. On 16 July the legates 
replied by excommunicating the Patriarch in a Bull which they placed on the 
hallowed altar of St Sophia itself. The insult was unforgivable. A synod of the 
Greek Church was convened to condemn the Latin heresies in creed and in 

practice, and to excommunicate the papal legates. It was the point of no return,

EIRIK 




Sometime before 1075 King Svein Ulfsson, nephew of Canute the Great, 
received a man called Audun, who had sailed from Greenland to Denmark to 
present him with a polar bear. The episode is recalled in a saga called 
Audun's Story. Shortly afterwards, the King received the German priest, 
Adam of Bremen, who was collecting information for his monumental 
history of the Archbishopric of Hamburg, under whose jurisdiction 
Scandinavia then fell. According to Adam, the King told him 'that there was 
another island in that ocean which had been discovered by many and was 
called Vmland because vines grow wild there and yield excellent wine, and 
moreover, self-grown grain grows there in abundance'. 1 It is the earliest 
European reference to North America. Archaeological evidence, notably 
from northern Newfoundland, confirms the fact that Norsemen did indeed 
found transatlantic settlements. 2 

The exploration of 'the Glacial Sea' extended over several centuries. 
Iceland was known to the Irish in the eighth century. Norse settlement began 
there c.870. Greenland was known some eighty years before it received its 
earliest colonists, c.985/6, the date which is also given to the first sighting of 
'Vinland'. 3 

The central figure in the explorations was the adventurer Eirik the Red 
(c.940-1002). Eirik left his home at Jaederen in Norway after a series of 
murders; but he then started a feud in Iceland when his slaves engineered a 
landslide to demolish a neighbour's farm. Outlawed by the Icelandic 
Assembly at Thorness, he sailed away to found a colony on the western 
coast of an island 'which he called Greenland, so that others would be 
tempted to go there'. This was fifteen years before Iceland officially adopted 
Christianity in ad 1000. Eirik's younger son, Leif Ericsson 'the Lucky', 
sailed on from Greenland c.1001 to test reports of land to the west, and 
returned with descriptions of Helluland ('Slab-land', probably Baffin 
Island), Markland ('Forest Land', probably Labrador), and the elusive 
Vinland, 'the Land of Grapes'. It was Tyrkir the German, a member of Leif's 
crew, who found the vines; and it was Thorfinn Karlsefni, the wealthy 
second husband of Eirik's daughter-in-law, Gutrid, who twice organized 
expeditions to site permanent settlements on the American shore. Eric's 
bastard daughter Freydis also visited Vinland twice. On the first occasion, 
she was said to have repulsed an Indian attack by baring her breasts. On the 
second, she murdered all her companions. In the autumn of 1009, Gutrid, 



Karlsefni's wife, and widow of Eirik's elder son, Thorstein, gave birth in 
Vinland to a boy called Snorri, the first Euro-American. 

The exact location of Vinland has caused endless scholarly headaches. 
The consensus now leans towards Newfoundland and a site at L'Anse-aux- 
Meadows. The vinber or 'wineberries' found by Tyrkir may well have been 
wild cranberries and the 'self-sown wheat' lyme grass. The subject has 
produced much 'Skandiknavery'. Among the sensations one must list a runic 
inscription for Ml or ad 1001 carved by some joker on a boulder at Martha's 
Vineyard in 1920, and Yale's Vinland Map produced in 1965. 4 

The main sources remain the Norse sagas, especially The Graerdandinga 
Saga (c.1190) Eirik's Saga (c.1260) and the Islandingabdk (c.1127), a 
history of the Icelanders commissioned by a bishop who was the great 
grandson of Snorri Karsefnisson. 5 

Except for Iceland, the outermost Norse colonies did not last. Vinland 
was abandoned after a few decades. Greenland, once prosperous from the 
trade in walrus ivory, furs, and snowy falcons, declined in the fourteenth 
century. Rickets and a deteriorating climate took their toll. The last ship from 
Greenland reached Iceland in 1410. 'The last Norse Greenlander died some 
time later, "unknelled, uncoffined, and unknown".' 6 His frozen remains, or 
those of one of his last companions, were discovered near the Greenland 
shore in 1586 by the Elizabethan explorer John Davys (1550-1605). Like 
Eirik the Red and Leif Ericsson exactly 600 years before, Davys was sailing 
to the far north-west in search of his fortune in mysterious lands beyond the 
'Great Passage'. 7 


The schism between East and West, Christendom's major scandal, has never 
been repaired. From 1054 onwards there were not only two supposedly 
universal.

The Christian liturgy has never been static. The Divine Office of hymns, 
psalms, lessons, homilies, responsories, canticles, and collects began to 
crystallize from the fifth century. The Canonical Hours, which enabled 
monks to spread out their recital of the 150 psalms, once recited daily, were 
instituted by St Benedict. Prudentius, Bishop of Troyes (d. 861) is credited 
with an early Breviary or summary of approved liturgical texts. 

The most solemn of the Christian sacraments, the Mass or missa, 
assumed definitive form slightly later. Variously known as the Eucharist or 
'Rite of Thanksgiving', as the 'Communion', or as the commemoration of 
'the Lord's Supper', it was customarily separated from the rest of the Divine 
Office. The earliest Missal or 'Order of the Mass' dates from the tenth 
century. The central act of Communion occurs when the priest consecrates 
bread and wine, the body and blood of Christ, and offers them to the 
communicants. From the thirteenth century to 1965, the Roman Church 
restricted the chalice of wine to the priestly celebrant. But now, as originally, 
it offers 'Communion in Both Kinds'. The theological implications of the 
Eucharist, notably the Thomist doctrine of transubstantiation, caused 
immense controversy during the Reformation. 

The custom of setting key parts of the Mass to music had far-reaching 
consequences. The Propers, or items whose words vary according to the 
occasion, were usually recited or chanted. They include the Introit, the 
Gradual, the Offertory, and the Communion Anthem. But the Ordinaries, 
whose text was invariable, opened the way for elaborate musical inventions. 
The Ordinaries include: the Kyrie Eleison ('Lord Have Mercy'), an ancient 
imprecation borrowed from sun worship; the Gloria in Excelsis Deo ('Glory 
to God on High'), a hymn usually omitted during Lent; the Credo or Nicene 
Creed; the Sanctus ('Holy, Holy, Holy'), an adorational hymn which 
prefaces the Communion; the Agnus Dei ('0 Lamb of God, who takest away 
the sins of the world'); and finally the Dismissal, Ite, missa est ('Go in 
peace; the Mass is ended'). 

Setting the Ordinaries for two or more voices, and then for choirs with 
instrumental accompaniment, presented the principal challenge of medieval 
polyphony. A complete Mass cycle was composed by Guillaume de Machaut 
(d. 1377), and similar compositions were common by the Renaissance. The 
supreme masters were undoubtedly Palestrina (d. 1594) and his 

contemporary, William Byrd (1543-1623), a Catholic in Anglican service. 



Palestrina's highly original Missa Papae Marcellae (1555) followed the 

instructions of the Council of Trent in giving maximum clarity to the words, 
[CANTUS] 

The impact of the Mass on musical history was incalculable. Just as 
incantation had transformed the spiritual and aesthetic effect of the liturgy, 
so the choral and instrumental arrangements of the Mass profoundly 
influenced Europe's evolving musical tradition. 'The liturgical text forms the 
portal through which music enters into the cultural history of the Western 
Christian world.' 1 

The stupendous Mass in B minor (1738) of J. S. Bach initiated a stage 
where musical performances of the Mass could be divorced from religious 
ceremony. Haydn wrote fourteen such masses, among them the Drum Mass 
(1796) and the Wind-Band Mass (1802). Mozart wrote eighteen, including 
the sublime, unfinished Requiem (1791). Beethoven's Missa Solemnis in D 
(1823) may be regarded as the zenith of the series, to be followed in 
Romantic style by those of Liszt, Gounod, Bruckner, and Janacek. In the 
twentieth century the Mass survived both the dilution of Christian belief and 
the disintegration of traditional musical form. Frederick Delius composed a 
choral Mass of Life (1909) based on anti-religious texts by Nietzsche. 
Stravinsky's Mass for Chorus and Wind Instruments (1948) experiments 
with neo-polyphonic techniques modelled on Machaut. 2 

Yet sung and unsung masses can be heard every day in Catholic and 
Orthodox churches around the world. Both the religious tradition and the 
musical genres descended from it are very much alive. 


Christian Empires; there were two supposedly universal and orthodox Christian 
Churches. Three hundred years earlier, the principal line of division in Europe 
lay between the Christian lands of the south and the heathen lands of the north. 
From now on, it lay between the Catholic lands of the West and the Orthodox 
lands of the East. (See Map 3.) 

1054-1268 

Whereas, in the age of the Vikings and Magyars, it was the West and Centre of 
Europe that had borne the brunt of the turmoil, it was the East that sustained the 




havoc when first the Seljuk Turks and then the Mongols appeared on the scene. 
Indeed, from the second half of the eleventh century onwards, Latin 
Christendom entered an era of reform and revitalization. In that same period the 
Eastern Empire entered a stage of irreversible decline. As shown by the 
Crusades, the two movements were not unrelated. 

At the time of the Schism between East and West, the Byzantine Empire was 
preoccupied with a series of petty upheavals caused by wars on the frontier and 
strife in the palace. Indeed, the revolts of generals, the ambitions of the 
Patriarch, and the intrigues of the empresses proved no less disruptive than the 
Normans in Italy, the Pechenegs on the Danube, and the Seljuk Turks in 
Armenia. The death of the ageing Theodora in 1057, which ended the 
Macedonian dynasty, distracted the Empire at the moment it faced its greatest 
challenge. 

The Saljuqs or Seljuks had crossed the Oxus in 1031, gaining mastery over 
Persia in the 1040s, Armenia in the 1060s, and Jerusalem in 1070. They came 
within a hair's breadth of capturing Baghdad. Their sultans, Tughril Beg (r. 
1038-63), the 'Reviver of Islam', and Alp Arslan (r. 1063-72), infused the 
fighting spirit which mobilized a motley following. Their entourage included 
Persian administrators, Greek advisers, and a rich company of philosophers, 
mathematicians, and poets: 


Awake! For Morning in the Bowl of Night 
Has flung the Stone that puts the Stars to Flight: 

And lo! the Hunter of the East has caught 
The Sultan's Turret in a Noose of Light. 


Here with a Loaf of Bread beneath the Bough, 
A Flask of Wine, a Book of Verse-and Thou 
Beside me, singing in the Wilderness- 
And wilderness is Paradise enow. 


'Tis all a chequer-board of Nights and Days 
Where Destiny with Men for pieces plays, 

Hither and thither moves, and mates, and slays, 



And one by one back in the Closet lays.- 

Omar Khayyam (1048-1131), whose Persian quatrains would be turned in 
translation into one of the favourite items of English literature, served as 
astronomer and calendarist at the Seljuk court under Alp Arslan, the architect of 
their greatest triumph. On 19 August 1071, at Manzikert near Lake Van, the 
Seljuks turned a border contest into an imperial rout. The Byzantine army was 
utterly destroyed. The Emperor, Romanus IV Diogenes, was captured. The 
Empire's heartland in Asia Minor was overrun, serving thenceforth as the base 
for the Turkish emirate of Rum. The Empire's population and economic 
resources were drastically reduced. 

Byzantium never fully recovered. From now on, the emperors were seeking 
to defend the shrinking foreground of Fortress Constantinople. The Seljuks, too, 
had shot their bolt. They soon lost the guardianship of Jerusalem to the ShTite 
Fatimids of Egypt; and the wars of rival emirs gave the Empire some respite. 
The energetic young Emperor Alexius I Comnenus (r. 1081-1118) held the line 
by a mixture of valour and dubious financial expedients, such as seizing the 
Church's treasure. He repulsed the Normans from Greece, and recovered a 
valuable stretch of the Pontic and Aegean shore. But a return to the status quo 
ante was out of the question. Under Manuel I (r. 1143-80), a certain 'Comnenian 
Renaissance' bloomed, especially in scholarship, theology, and architecture. 
Grandiose schemes for reuniting with Rome or for conquering Egypt came to 
nought. The growing influence of the Latins, with whom Manuel packed his 
court, led to increasing friction, especially with the Venetians. The degenerate 
Andronicus Comnenus (r. 1183-5) was tortured to death by a mob which 
followed his own example. The facade of greatness was still intact. 
Constantinople was still the richest and most civilized city of Christendom: its 
trade, its ceremonies, its intense religious devotions continued in full swing. But 
the substance was ebbing away. Its body politic awaited the shock which in 1204 
would all but kill it dead. 

Byzantium's distress produced serious repercussions in the Orthodox Slav 
lands. There was neither the will nor the means whereby the Greek Patriarch 
could exercise the same control over Bulgars, Serbs, or Kievans as the Papacy 
was now beginning to exercise in the West. In the century after Manzikert, the 
Balkans descended once more into turmoil. The Pechenegs, who reached the 
walls of Constantinople for a second time in 1090, were not subdued until 1122. 


Long campaigns had to be fought in the north-west to hold Serbia from the 
Magyars. In 1186 the Bulgars broke free once more to found their 'Second 
Empire'. 

Kievan Rus' was largely left to its own devices. Jaroslav the Wise (r. 1019- 
54), successor to St Volodymyr, had taken Red Ruthenia from the Poles, had 
defeated the Pechenegs, and had even sent a major naval expedition against 
Constantinople. But on his death, the state disintegrated into warring 
principalities-Halicz and Volhynia in the west; Kiev, Turov, Chernigov in the 
south; Novgorod, Polotsk, and Smolensk in the north; Tver, Vladimir-Suzdal, 
and Ryazan on the upper Volga. The dissensions of Rus' were cleverly fanned by 
the Byzantines, and might well have been exploited by the neighbouring Poles 
had the Polish kingdom itself not fallen likewise into an extended period of 
fragmentation after 1138. The primitive kingdoms of the Slavs stood in 
considerable disarray long before the arrival of the Mongols. 

Divergences among the east Slavs now became evident. Kiev remained a 
commercial and religious centre; but it was exposed to the whims of the 
Pechenegs (Patzinaks) and Polovtsians (Cumans) on the steppes, and had all but 
lost political control. In the twelfth century the name Ukraina, meaning 'On the 
edge' or 'the frontier', was first applied to the lands round Kiev. Halicz (Galicia), 
first noted in 1140, and Volhynia passed under the Romanowicz dynasty. Daniel 
Romanowicz (r. 1235-65) received his crown from a papal legate, but later 
renounced the Catholic connection. According to one chronicle, he was urged to 
side with the people in suppressing the boyars. 'You cannot eat the honey', he 
was told, 'until you have killed the bees.' 

The north-eastern principalities of Rus' attracted an important peasant 
migration into the forest zone of the upper Volga, which helped the growth of 
cities. The settlement of Moscow on the River Moskva was first recorded in 
1146. In 1169 Andrei Bogulyubsky, Prince of Vladimir, was strong enough to 
sack Kiev. In 1185 Prince Igor of Sever led a famous expedition against the 
Polovtsians. The city of Novgorod began its career as an independent republic 
from 1126. Its veche, an assembly of its free citizens, elected both the chief 
administrator and the archbishop. It set the terms of the contract which limited 
the powers of the ruling prince. Huge territories in the north, as far as the 
monastery of St Michael the Archangel on the White Sea, were subject to 
Novgorod's writ. Alexander Nevsky (c. 1220-63), Prince of Vladimir and 
Novgorod, repelled both the Swedes on the Neva (1240) and the Teutonic 



knights on the ice of Lake Peipus. [Novgorod] 

Another clear beneficiary of Byzantium's decline was the fledgeling 
kingdom of Hungary. Protected to the north by the Carpathians, and safely 
distanced both from Constantinople and from the German Empire, Hungary 
could consolidate its hold on the Danube basin without serious opposition. In 
1004 it took control of Transylvania, and after 1089 of Croatia and Dalmatia, 
opening an important corridor to the sea. In the twelfth century it absorbed the 
beautiful mountain-girt province of Bosnia. In all the peripheral territories, 
including Upper Hungary (Slovakia), Magyar nobles of the Latin faith were 
established on vast estates largely inhabited by Slavs, Germans, or Romanians. 
On the eastern borders, a lengthy military zone was permanently settled by 
conquered Cumans. Paganism was eradicated. Under the 'soldier king', St 
Ladislas or Laszlo (r. 1077-95) and his nephew Coloman I or Kalman (r. 1095- 
1116), both of whom had close family ties with Constantinople, the pioneering 
tasks of St Stephen were concluded. As early as 1222, in the 'Golden Bull' of 
Andreas II, the Hungarian king confirmed the immunity of the nobles and high 
clergy, who formed a national assembly armed with the formal right of 
resistance. 

The Byzantine retreat also led to important changes in Transcaucasia. The 
Bagratid state of Greater Armenia, based on Ani near Kars, which had flourished 
since the ninth century, was submerged by the Seljuks. Many Armenians were 
driven into exile, some as far afield as Poland. A rump state of 'Little Armenia' 
was set up in the south, in the former province of Cilicia; and it survived for 
three centuries more.- But Georgia broke free: under David the Renovator (r. 
1089-1125), the Seljuks were repulsed from Tbilisi. Under Queen Tamara (r. 
1184-1213) a brilliant court culture flourished, the native Christian element 
blending with Turkish, Persian, and Arab infusions. The poet Shot'ha Rust'aveli, 
who was educated in Greece, gained international renown. His epic poem, 
Knight in a Tiger Skin, dedicated to Tamara, has been optimistically classified as 
'the first breath of the Renaissance'.- 

Medieval society remained overwhelmingly rural. Life was centred on the feudal 
estates, and on the timeless relations of lord and serf. The emergence of cities in 
embryo, therefore, did not change the overall scene; but it was important, not 
merely for the future but for the organization of trade and the spread of culture. 

Walled cities, like walled castles, reflected the insecurities of the countryside. 


Their ramparts, their gates and towers were designed to protect an oasis of 
safety. But they also fostered distinct social communities, which increasingly 
sought to give themselves a separate legal and political identity. They coalesced 
around ports and river-crossings, around markets, or around the residences of 
counts and bishops. Many nascent towns failed and relapsed into obscurity; but 
by the twelfth century several regions of Europe were beginning to show pockets 
of vigorous urbanization. The Italian port cities of Venice, Pisa, and Genoa led 
the way. They were soon rivalled by the cities of Lombardy and of the 
Rhineland, and by clusters of textile towns-Florence and Siena in Tuscany, 
Ypres, Bmges, and Ghent in Flanders. London and Paris grew for political as 
well as for economic reasons. The largest of them had populations of 50,000 or 
more, and rising, [fiesta] 

Urban society was marked by the formation of a class of burghers, who 
organized themselves against the more numerous artisans and rootless elements. 
The important thing was that most of these city-dwellers in the West freed 
themselves from the feudal relations prevailing beyond the city walls. 'Freedom 
became the legal status of the bourgeoisie ... no longer a personal privilege, but 
a territorial one, inherent in the urban soil.'-* Slavery on the Muslim model, 
however, was common, especially in Italy. Special charters were issued to cope 
with the influx of Jews brought in by Mediterranean trade, [ghetto] 

Trade patterns were determined by a handful of well-tried routes. Venice and 
Genoa took over from Constantinople as the organizers of trade with the Levant. 
The North Sea routes were built up in response to the demand for English wool. 
Lombardy and the Rhineland stood at either end of the transalpine corridor. 
From 1180 the Counts of Champagne established an early form of free-trade 

zone, whose fairs became the clearing-house of international commerce, 
[GOTTHARD] [HANSA] 

In the second half of the eleventh century, in many parts of Western Europe, a 
series of seemingly unconnected innovations set long-lasting processes in 
motion. Institutions were starting to gel; temporary expedients turned themselves 
into plans for a long-term future. 

On 14 April 1059 Pope Nicholas II decreed that papal elections should be 
conducted by the College of Cardinals. The move was designed to assert the 
independence of the Papacy and to avoid the scenes of the previous year, when 
two rival popes had been appointed by two rival factions. For centuries, the 


traditional appointment of popes by 'the people and clergy of Rome' had left 
them at the mercy of local politics. More recently, the German emperors had 
assumed the practice of nominating candidates. Now the Papacy was taking the 
necessary steps to free itself from external control. The Roman Curia, the papal 
court and government, was first mentioned shortly afterwards, [conclave] 

In August 1059, at Melfi in Apulia, Robert Guiscard, fourth of twelve sons 
of Tancred d'Hauteville, was invested by the Pope with the Duchy of Apulia and 
Calabria, together with the 'future' Duchy of Sicily. In return, if he could seize 
the allocated lands, Duke Robert was to pay the Pope a fee of twelve pence per 
ploughland. At the time, the treaty represented just another twist in the Papacy's 
tortuous diplomacy. Ever since their arrival in Calabria in 1017, the Norman 
adventurers had been opposed by Rome; indeed, in the middle of the Schism 
with Byzantium in 1054, having marched south with a German army, Pope Leo 
IX had been the Normans' prisoner. But now Nicholas II decided to do business 
with them. What he could not have foreseen was that the d'Hautevilles would 
put their plans so promptly into practice. They crossed the Straits of Messina in 
1060 and started the systematic conquest of Sicily from the Saracens. Within a 
decade they had both captured Palermo and driven the Byzantines from their last 
Italian foothold at Bari. In due course the Norman conquests in the south were 
united into one 'Kingdom of the Two Sicilies', which survived until the days of 
Garibaldi. 



FIESTA 


In ad 1000 the Doge of Venice took the title of Duke of Dalmatia after 
capturing the strongholds of the Adriatic pirates at Curzola and Lagosta. It 
was Venice's first step to becoming a naval power. The ceremony of the 
Sposalizio del Mar, the 'Wedding of the Doge and the Sea', where a regatta 
of bedecked gondolas parades down the Grand Canal, began that same year. 
It used to be the centrepiece of Venice's annual Ascension Day Fair, the 
Sensa, but now forms part of the Regata Storica in September. 

The European calendar is packed with festivals that feature every sort of 
procession, masked parade, dance, fair, or games. Many of them, such as the 
Bloemen Curso in Haarlem, the Midsommer in Sweden, or the beer-swilling 
Oktoberfest in Munich, celebrate the passing of the seasons. The days of 
Fasching which occur throughout Germany and Austria, like the fire¬ 
burning Dozynki in Poland, are pagan survivals. France's fetes des vignerons 
are the wine-growers' equivalent of harvest festivals. 

Many others have religious connections. The Carnaval or 'Farewell to 
the Flesh', held on Mardi Gras or 'Pancake Tuesday', is best known in Nice. 
It marks the last day before the fast of Lent. The Easter Semana Santa in 
Seville sees penitents parade in high-pointed black hats. Corpus Christi is 
another day for general Christian witness, as are Whitsun and the Feast of 
the Blessed Virgin (15 August). At Sainte-Marie de la Mer near Arles, 
gypsies from many countries carry their icon of the Virgin into the sea. The 
procession of the Holy Blood at Bruges and the Ommegang in Brussels 
honour local relics. 

Many fiestas take the form of public contests. Such are the highland 
games in Scotland, the course a la cocarde in the Roman arenas at Arles and 
Nunes, the bull-running at Pamplona, and the magnificent horseback races 
of the Palio at Siena. 

Most often, however, Europeans set out to remember the dramatic events 
which, like the Sposalizio, pepper the history of their cities: 

Morns y Cristianos Alcoy (Alicante) the Christian conquest of 1227 



Lajkonik Cracow (Poland) the Mongol raids (13th c.) 

Giostra del Saracino Arezzo (Italy) (jousting): the Saracen wars 

Jeanne d'Arc Orleans (France) the siege of 1428 

Fiirstenhochzeit Landshut (Bavaria) the Bavarian-Polish wedding of 1475 

Escalade Geneva (CH) the Savoyard assault of 1602 

Guy Fawkes England Gunpowder Plot, 1605 

UpHellyAa Lerwick (Shetland) Viking rule, 751 

Meistertrunk Rothenberg (Germany) the siege of 1631 

Vikingspillene Frederikssund (Denmark) discovery of a Viking ship, 1950 

Old or new, fiestas are annual events. They cement local pride to the 
continuity of the passing centuries. 1 

Yet nothing is so grand as the festivals and parades which accompany 
military victories. In June 1940 the Wehrmacht marched symbolically 
through the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Five years later, in Red Square, the 
Wehrmacht's banners were piled up high at Stalin's feet. In the Allied 
countries, though not in Germany, 11 November has been honoured for 
decades with solemn pomp as 'Remembrance Day'. 


GHETTO 

In many Italian cities, walled and gated quarters reserved for Jews had 
existed at least since the eleventh century. They resulted from the 
concordance of view between the municipal magistrates, who demanded 
segregation, and the Jews' own religious laws, which forbade residence 
among Gentiles. In Venice, the Jewish quarter was called // Ghetto, either 
from a contraction of borghetto or 'little town' or from a deformation of the 
gietto or 'foundry' which had once existed there. The name came to be used 
across Europe. Major ghettos were created in Prague, Frankfurt, Trieste, and 
in Rome, where the ghetto was maintained from 1536 to 1870. 1 

Formal ghettos were unknown, however, in the Jews' main refuge in 
Poland-Lithuania, where royal charters of protection were in force from 
1265. Several Polish cities, including Warsaw, enforced statutes de non 
tolerandis Judaeis, which excluded Jews from districts under municipal 




jurisdiction. (Nobles, peasants, and officers of the Crown were similarly 
excluded.) The effect was to channel Jewish residence on to noble-owned 
land in the immediate vicinity of the city gates. Small Jewish shtetln or 
'townlets' also grew up under noble patronage alongside manorial centres in 
the countryside. The Jews of Poland-Lithuania possessed both local 
autonomy and, in their Council of the Four Lands, their own central 
parliament. 2 

No Jews were permitted to reside in Russia prior to the partitions of 
Poland. After the partitions, Catherine II turned Russia's ex-Polish provinces 
into the core of a huge Jewish 'pale of settlement' (see Appendix III, p. 
1311). But closed ghettos of the Western type did not reach Eastern Europe 
until the Nazi advance of 1939-41. 

To escape from the ghetto was no simple matter. Would-be escapees had 
to defy the laws and customs both of the Gentile and of the Jewish 
communities, and to risk dire penalties. Until modern times, formal 
conversion was often the only practical way out. 


Before the conquest of Sicily was complete, the Papacy decided to back 
another Norman adventurer. In 1066 William the Bastard, Duke of Normandy, 
was sent the banner of St Peter to bless his expedition against England. From 
Rome's point of view this was another move to build up a body of papal 
supporters who were independent of the Empire. From William's point of view it 
was a means of persuading his troops to fight. (He later repudiated the papal 
claim to a deal similar to the one agreed over Sicily.) But once again fortune 
favoured the venture. Having waited many weeks to cross the Channel, the 
Normans attacked the Anglo-Saxon army waiting at Hastings. Harold of 
England, having been given the time to return from the north, where he had 
defeated his other rival, Harold of Norway, was confident of further success. But 
on 28 September he died in battle, pierced through the eye by a Norman arrow. 
William, now the Conqueror, was crowned in Westminster Abbey at Christmas. 
The kingdom of England, like Sicily, was parcelled out among the Norman 
knights and turned into a model feudal kingdom. (The English claim that it has 
never been conquered since.) 

In March 1075 a new Pope, Gregory VII (1073-85), enunciated the twenty- 
seven propositions of his Dictatus Papae (the Pope's Supremacy). He claimed 




supreme legislative and judicial power within Christendom, together with the 
right to depose all princes, both temporal and spiritual. Soon afterwards, in 
synod, he formally ordered the excommunication of all secular rulers who 
invested candidates for church appointments without reference to ecclesiastical 
authority. The Pope, formerly Hildebrand, a Tuscan monk and the principal 
adviser of the preceding popes, had been elected by the cardinals in the new 
manner. The Emperor, Henry IV (r. 1056-1106), had not been notified, let alone 
consulted. A major conflict between Empire and Papacy was unavoidable. It was 
the start of the Investiture Contest. 

Despite the high-flown legal and theological language in which it was 
conducted, the Investiture Contest was a straightforward struggle for power. Was 
the Emperor to control the Pope, or the Pope to control the Emperor? The agreed 
theory was simple: Latin Christendom was supported by two pillars of authority 
-the temporal, headed by the Emperor, and the spiritual, headed by the Pope. 
But the relationship between the two was open to interpretation. In the imperial 
view, the Pope should have confined his attentions to the spiritual sphere. In the 
papal view, just as earth was below heaven, so the Emperor should submit to the 
will of the Pope. The propositions of Hildebrand's Dictatus were 
uncompromising: 

2. The Roman Pontiff alone merits the Catholic or 'universal' title. 

3. The Pontiff alone can depose and absolve bishops. 

12. The Pontiff is permitted to depose emperors. 

16. The Pontiff alone can convene a General Synod. 

20. No one can condemn a decision of the Holy See. 


HANSA 

As German colonists and crusaders moved eastwards along the Baltic 
shore, it was natural that commercial interests would follow. Equally, in a 
region emerging from the Viking Age, it was only to be expected that 
merchants established in Baltic and North Sea ports would band together for 
protection. The first such hansa or 'commercial association' was established 
at Wisby on the island of Gotland in 1161 under the name of the 'United 




Gotland Travellers of the Holy Roman Empire'. Within a century, a far-flung 
confederation of am-see staten or Tree cities of the sea' had developed from 
the Atlantic to the Gulf of Finland. 

The Bund van der dudeschen hanse or 'Hanseatic League' rose to the 
peak of its influence in the course of the 14th century. It comprised a series 
of constituent leagues, whose delegates met regularly to co-ordinate policy. 
The most important of these was the 'Wendish-Saxon Quarter' based on 
Hamburg, Bremen, Liibeck, Wismar, and Rostock. The Westphalian group 
was headed by Cologne, the Livonian group by Wisby, later by Reval. The 
three main groups formed the Drittel or 'Triangle' at the core of the 
organization. Each of the member cities possessed dependent towns known 
as vororte or 'suburbs', whilst the League as a whole established a chain 
of kontore or 'foreign offices' from which all members could benefit. Five 
key offices were maintained: at Bruges-the main terminus of the 
transalpine trade-route to Venice, at the 'Peterhof ' in Novgorod (from 1229), 
at the 'Steelyard' in London (1237), at the 'German Bridge' in Bergen 
(1343), and at the annual herring market at Falsterbo in Skania. 

Hansa membership was confined neither to Germany nor the littoral. At 
various times, over two hundred cities belonged to the network. They 
stretched from Dinant in the West to Oslo in the North and Narva in the East. 
Major inland members included Brunswick, Magdeburg, Breslau, and 
Cracow. 

The Hanseatic League possessed no formal constitution and no central 
government. But a body of law and custom accumulated; and from 1373 the 
Free Imperial City of Liibeck was confirmed as the home of the court of 
appeal and as the most frequent meeting-place for the League's triennial 
Hansetage or 'General Assemblies'. The Law of Liibeck was adopted by 
many member cities. 

In its early days, the League aimed to consolidate the legal rights of 
anchorage, storage, residence, and local immunity, which its members 
required to conduct their business. It was also concerned to stabilize 
currency and to facilitate the means of payment. (The English word sterling 
derives from 'Easterling', an epithet widely applied to Hansa merchants.) 

Yet the pursuit of mercantile interests soon involved politics. The 
League's original weapon lay in the Verhansung or 'commercial boycott' of 
its enemies. But it was gradually obliged to levy taxes and to raise naval 



forces, first to suppress pirates and then to contest the policies of established 
kingdoms, especially Denmark. An alliance between Norway, Sweden, and 
the Hansa was provoked by the Danish sacking of Wisby in 1361. In that 
first Danish War, the League was heavily defeated. But in the second war of 
1368-9, the troops of the League captured Helsingborg, destroyed 
Copenhagen, and occupied the Sound. By the Treaty of Stralsund (1370), 
Denmark was forced to concede that no Danish King could be crowned 
without the League's approval and the confirmation of its privileges, [sund] 

Thereafter, the slow decline of the Hanseatic League was the result both 
of economic and of political factors. The Baltic herring shoals mysteriously 
relocated to the North Sea in the fifteenth century. In the same period, 
northern Europe's centre of commercial gravity was shifting to the 
Netherlands. The Hansa met increasing difficulty in asserting itself against 
aggressive modern states such as England, Prussia, and Muscovy. The 
closing of the Peterhof in Novgorod in 1494 was a sign of the times, as was 
the closing of the Steelyard in London in 1598. The Hansa received little 
support from the fragmented authority of the Holy Roman Empire. During 
the Thirty Years War it was reduced to an active membership of three- 
Liibeck, Hamburg, and Bremen-who held their last General Assembly in 
1669. From then on, the Hansa name was connected only with the 
independence of those three cities, which stayed apart from the German 
Customs Union until 1889. 1 

The legacy of the Hansa long outlived its demise. Over the centuries it 
had created a way of life whose solid virtues were cemented into every stone 
of its bustling and elegant cities. To be Hanseatic was to belong to an 
inimitable, international civilization based on shared values and priorities. 
Great cities such as Hamburg, Danzig (Gdansk), or Riga were not to share a 
common political destiny. But they retained a strong sense of their common 
origins. The citizens of Hamburg still take pride in registering their cars 
under the ancient municipal formula of 'HH '-Hansestadt Hamburg. 
Bremeners display 'HB'; Ltibeckers 'HL', Rostockers 'HRO'. 

Nazi ideology naturally made great efforts to appropriate the Hanseatic 
tradition. In a famous Grotemeyer painting of 1942, for example, a medieval 
wagon train sets out along the Elbe from Hamburg as if to conquer 
Germany's Lebensraum in the East. 2 But this was a gross distortion. In 
German History, the Hanseatic tradition stands in stark contrast to the 



Prussianism, nationalism, and imperialism which supplanted it. In European 
history, it shines as a beacon for all who seek a future based on sturdy local 
autonomy, international co-operation, and mutual prosperity. 


22. The Church of Rome has never erred, and as Scripture attests, can never 
err in the future ... 

23. No one who opposes the Church of Rome can be considered Catholic. 

27. The Pontiff can release the vassals of unjust men from their oath of 

loyalty...- 

At first sight, since the Pope had no means of enforcement at his command, 
it appeared that the Emperor's position was the stronger one. In practice, since 
many bishops resented their dependence on secular patrons, and since many 
barons resented their dependence on prince or emperor, the centrifugal forces of 
the feudal order worked to the Pope's advantage. In the long run, the Contest 
ended in stalemate and compromise; but not before, in the first round, the 
Emperor suffered comprehensive humiliation. 

Hildebrand's challenge provoked an unholy brawl. At the Emperor's 
command, the bishops of the Empire excommunicated the Pope. The Pope 
promptly excommunicated the Emperor, releasing the Emperor's subjects from 
their allegiance. The German barons thereon rebelled, and chose Rudolf of 
Swabia as their 'anticaesar'. Henry chose penitence. Crossing the Mont Cenis in 
winter with his wife and child, he sought out Hildebrand in the lonely castle of 
Canossa. There he stood barefoot for three days in the snow, dressed in rags and 
begging the Pope for forgiveness. On the fourth day Hildebrand relented, and 
Henry threw himself at his feet, crying 'Holy Father, spare me!' But the 
dramatics of Canossa achieved nothing; Henry soon returned to his habit of lay 
investiture. After a long civil war in Germany, and Henry's second 
excommunication, a synod of imperial bishops met at Brixen and elected an 
'antipope', Clement III. The West now had two Popes and two Emperors. In 
1083-4 the imperial party captured Rome, with Hildebrand holed up in the 
Castel Sant'Angelo. Robert Guiscard saw them off with a Saracen army, which 
put Rome to the sack. Hildebrand died in exile. Henry died in 1106, but not 
before his second wife Adelaide had publicly laid charges against him with the 
Church. The Concordat of Worms in 1122 called a truce in the wrangles, with 





Pope and Emperor both granted a hand in investiture, [marston] 

In 1075 the city of Pisa sought papal approval for its municipal code of laws, 
the consuetudine di mare. They were confirmed by an imperial patent six years 
later. As part of the arrangement, the local Duke of Tuscany renounced all 
jurisdiction within the city, and undertook to name no new marquis in the region 
without the Pisans' consent. At the time Pisa was simply taking precautions 
against the brewing conflict between Pope and Emperor; but it was pioneering 
the process whereby leading cities could establish communal independence. Pisa 
had grown rich from the plunder of the campaigns against the Saracens in Sicily 
and Sardinia, as reflected in the marble splendours of its cathedral with the 
leaning baptistery tower (c.1089). In due course it was subdued by its maritime 
rival, Genoa, and absorbed by its landward neighbour, Florence. But the growth 
of wealthy city communes, replete with constitutions, military forces, and civic 
pride, was a feature of ensuing centuries. In France, Le Mans, St Quentin, and 
Beauvais were self-regulating cities by the end of the eleventh century. In 
Flanders, the charter 


MARSTON 

Old Marston happens to be the nearest medieval parish to where this book 
is being written. It has had a continuous history for nearly 900 years. A 
chapel on the site was granted to the Austin Priory of St Frideswide in 
Oxford in 1122; and it was raised to the status of a parish in the following 
century. In 1451 a papal bull joined it to the neighbouring parish of 
Headington in an arrangement which lasted until 1637. For much of the 
modern period, the living lay in the gift of the lordship of Headington. 

In its long history, Marston has seen few momentous events. This 'marsh 
village', three miles from the city of Oxford, had no interesting features 
other than the Marston Ferry, which plied across the River Cherwell from 
1279 until the 1960s. At its greatest extent prior to the growth of the modern 
city suburbs, the village was inhabited by forty or fifty households, who 
worked some 600 acres of arable land and possessed some 200 horses and 
cattle and 800 sheep. After 1655, when the two main fields were enclosed 
for pasture, the population declined. During the English Civil War, Marston 




was occupied by the Parliamentary forces besieging the King's headquarters 
in Oxford. The Parliamentary commander, Sir Thomas Fairfax, was billeted 
in 1643 with the Croke family at Marston Manor House, where he received a 
visit from Oliver Cromwell. There was no school in the village before 1816, 
when a boarding-house was established for paying pupils. The elementary 
school opened in 1851. The only charitable foundation in the parish was 
created in 1671 by the will of Mary Brett, widow, who left a house and a 
parcel of land worth 22s. 6d. for providing bread for the poor. The only 
inhabitant of the parish to achieve national fame was a fox-terrier bitch 
called 'Trump', who was purchased in the hamlet of Elsfield in 1815. 
Trump's new master, the sporting parson, Revd. Jack Russell, used her to 
found the canine breed that bears his name. 1 

The Parish Church of St Nicholas, Marston, built in Late Perpendicular 
Gothic, is described as 'unpretentious'. 2 There is a low west tower with 
battlemented parapet. Only tiny portions of the original fabric survive. Most 
of the stonework dates from the fifteenth century, as restored in 1883. The 
plain oak furnishing of the interior is largely Elizabethan or Jacobean. 

A list of officiating clergy from c. 121 Oto 1991 hangs on a board in the 
nave. Despite the interval between 1529 and 1637 when Marston was served 
by non-resident curates, the list conveys a strong sense of continuity. The 
name of the earliest recorded priest is Osbert, son of Hereward (c.1210). 
John de Bradeley (1349) died in the Black Death. Robert Kene (1397-8) was 
the first priest to use a surname. Thomas Fylldar (1529), a Dominican, was 
the last Catholic priest before the Reformation. John Allen (1637-85), an 
appointee of Archbishop Laud, served the reconstituted parish for forty-eight 
years. So, too, did his Edwardian successor, John Hamilton Mortimer (1904- 
52). 

All over Europe, tens of thousands of church parishes form a network of 
territorial authority, which is often much older and more continuous than that 
of the civil power. They answer to the bishop as opposed to the Crown. In 
England, they pre-dated the counties. They coincide in large measure with 
the village communities, where the parish priest has been a central figure of 
respect and influence regardless of the changes in political regime and land 
ownership. In recent times, the parish council has provided an element of 
local democracy and, together with the parish pump and the parish hall, a 



focus for social life. 


Parish registers of births, marriages, and deaths, which in England have 
been kept since the reign of Elizabeth I, are one of the major sources of 
genealogical and demographic information. They provide the natural 
gateway into local history. 3 

Above all, the parish is the corner-stone of the ordered life of Europe's 
countryside. The villagers' ceaseless toil against the seasons has survived 
serfdom, plagues, famines, wars, poverty, and the CAP: 

Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife, 

Their sober wishes never learned to stray; 

Along the cool sequestered vale of life 
They kept the noiseless tenor of their way. 4 


St Omer (1127) led the way for Bruges and Ghent. In north Germany, the self- 
government of Liibeck (1143) preceded that of Hamburg (1189). Within these 
communes, merchant associations and craft guilds began to form. 

In May 1082 the city of Venice received a charter of liberties from the 
Byzantine Emperor, guaranteeing freedom of transit and exemption from taxes 
and duties throughout the Empire west of the Bosporus. Three quays were to be 
reserved for Venetian use on the Golden Horn. At the time the concessions must 
have, seemed a reasonable price to pay for Venice's help in the Emperor's 
Norman wars. Trade between Italy and the Levant had been severely restricted 
since the Muslim conquests of the seventh century, and the merchants of Venice, 
who had been the Emperor's subjects as well as his allies, were hardly a major 
power. In the event the 'Golden Bull' of 1082 proved to be a milestone. Granted 
on the eve of the Crusades and the reopening of the eastern Mediterranean, it 
turned the Venetian lagoon into the principal emporium between East and West, 
the home base for a seaborne fortune that was to rival Constantinople itself. 
Previously the city of St Mark, whose relics had been brought to the Rialto in 
828, had been overshadowed by the nearby island of Torcello. The ravages of the 
Magyars, like the earlier invasion of the Lombards which had propelled the first 
refugees into the lagoon in the first place, had disrupted contacts with Germany. 
Henceforth, transalpine trade was to boom. With a chain of forts, trading stations 
and later colonies at Ragusa, Corfu, Corinth, Crete, and Cyprus, the Venetian 




galleys could protect the convoys carrying silks, spices, silver and slaves, timber, 
corn, and salt. The Republic of Venice did not have an easy relationship with 
Byzantium; in 1182 all its merchants in Constantinople were massacred. But it 
outlasted the Empire, surviving until destroyed by Napoleon in 1797. [ghetto]

In 1084, at the monastery of Chartreuse near Grenoble, the Carthusian Order 
was founded by St Bruno of Cologne (1033-1101). Its strict contemplative rules 
directed the monks to live in silence in closed cells. At the time it must have 
seemed just an austere variation on the older Cluniac model; in fact it was the 
sign that the Latin Church was moving into an era of systematic 
institutionalization. In 1098, at Citeaux in Burgundy, the long career of the 
Cistercian Order was launched. It owed its main development to St Bernard of 
Clairvaux (1090-1153). Elsewhere, secular clerics or Tegular canons' entered 
organized communities governed by the three vows of chastity, poverty, and 
obedience. Most adopted the Rule of St Augustine, and hence were known as 
Augustinians. One such group, the Premonstratensians or Norbertines, founded 
by St Norbert at Premontre near Laon in 1120, spread widely in Eastern as well 
as Western Europe. In those same years, the monks at Cluny were building a 
church which for five centuries remained the largest in Western Christendom. 

In the summer of 1085 Alfonso VI of Castile-Leon captured the Muslim city 
of Toledo. At the time, it appeared to be just one more incident on the Christian- 
Muslim frontier: Alfonso was in league with the Emir of Seville, and was 
keeping the Emir's daughter as his concubine. In fact it proved to be the first 
step in the Christian Reconquista -the 400-year-struggle for possession of the 
Iberian peninsula. Toledo was the largest and most central of some twenty-five 
taifa or 'party' kingdoms into which the old Cordoban emirate had fragmented. 
Their disunity gave the Christian rulers their chance. Within the decade, 
Alfonso's champion, Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, El Cid, had entered Valencia. 
Within a century, the wars of Christian and Muslim had turned into a general 
contest of attrition on all fronts. The Moors suffered a decisive defeat at the pass 
of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212. The capture of Cordova in 1236, of Seville in 
1248, and of Murcia in 1266 put the greater part of the Peninsula into Christian 
hands, [el cid] 

On 27 November 1095, at the synod of Clermont in Auvergne, Pope Urban II 
appealed to all Christians to fight for the delivery of Jerusalem. Enthroned on a 
dais on the hillside below Notre Dame du Port, he addressed a great throng of 
mitred bishops, knights, and common people. At the time he was seeking to 



promote the so-called Truce of God, and to bring a halt to the endemic warfare 
of feudal society. He was also pursuing a policy of reconciliation with the 
Byzantine Patriarch, wishing to share the Byzantines' distress at the Turkish 
advance. Yet his appeal struck a chordof popular sympathy: the crowd roared 
Dios b volt, 'God wishes it'; a cardinal fell on his knees and, in the name of the 
multitude, seized with convulsive trembling, recited the Confiteor. There and 
then, men jostled to join. The proposal for a Crusade, a 'War of the Cross', was 
taken up throughout the Latin Church. Preachers such as Peter the Hermit spread 
the word. Henceforth, for six or seven generations, counts, kings, commoners, 
and even children flocked 'to take the Cross' and to fight the infidel in the Holy 
Land. 


MORES 

In the late eleventh century, when a Byzantine princess arrived in Venice to 
marry the Doge, it was found that she ate her food with a golden fork. She 
was reprimanded by the Bishop for anti-social behaviour. People in the 
medieval West took meat with their fingers from a common dish. The fork 
came into general use only during the Renaissance, and only for lifting 
morsels to one's own plate. 1 The table set of knife, fork, and spoon was an 
eighteenth-century innovation. 

European manners can be thoroughly studied from the stream of manuals 
written to teach people how to behave. The earliest such manuals, such as 
De institutione novitarum by Hugh St Victor (d. 1141), were addressed to 
clerics. The thirteenth-century Bavarian Hofzucht (Courtly Manners), 
attributed to Tannhauser, was directed at boorish courtiers, as was John 
Russell's fifteenth-century Book of Courtesy e. The most influential 
publication of the genre, the De Civilitate Morum Puerilium (1530) by 
Erasmus, ran into 130 editions. It was reprinted in Russia when Peter the 
Great sought to 'civilize' his court 200 years later. 2 // Cortegiano (The 
Courtier, 1528), by Baldassare Castiglione, and a similar Latin treatise 
(1566) by Lukasz Gornicki, enjoyed long-standing international fame. 
Thereafter, numerous guides to the conduct of 'high society', especially on 
the French model, were used to spread the cultivation of manners into ever- 




widening social circles. 

At one time, historians treated manners as a subject of passing fashions. 
But serious analysts have argued that they provide the outward evidence for 
profound social and psychological changes. Attitudes to every activity can 
be plotted overtime, and related to long-term trends. 

Injunctions about spitting, for example, reveal a number of basic shifts: 
Do not spit over or on the table. (English c.1463) 

Do not spit across the table as hunters do. (German, 15th cent.) 

Turn away when spitting, lest your saliva fall on someone. If anything 
pumlent falls to the ground, it should be trodden upon. (Erasmus, 1530) 

You should abstain from spitting at table, if possible. (Italian, 1558) 

Formerly, it was permitted to spit on the ground before people of rank.... 
Today, that is an indecency. (French, 1572) 

Frequent spitting is disagreeable. At important houses, one spits into one's 
handkerchief ... Do not spit so far that you have to look for the saliva to 
stamp on it. (Fiege, 1714) 

It is very ill-mannered to swallow what should be spat... After spitting into 
your handkerchief, you should fold it once, without looking at it, and put 
it in your pocket. (Fa Salle, 1729) 

It is unpardonably gross for children to spit in the faces of their playmates. 
(Fa Salle, 1774) 

Spitting is at all times a disgusting habit. Besides being coarse and atrocious, 
it is very bad for the health. (English, 1859) 

Have you noticed that today we [hide] what our fathers did not hesitate to 
display openly? ... The spittoon is a piece of furniture no longer found in 
modern households. (Cabanes, 1910) 3 

It emerges that the need to spit was not challenged until the eighteenth 
century, although the constraints about where, when, and how to spit had 
grown steadily. In the nineteenth century, spitting fell into disrepute, perhaps 
through fear of tuberculosis. Yet a certain hypocrisy separated the rules of 
good manners and the widespread use of the spittoon-a vessel required by 
the habit of tobacco-chewing. Only in the twentieth century did a total ban 
become effective. 'No Spitting' notices were retained on Fondon buses until 
the 1960s. By that time certain rock groups were urging their fans to spit as a 



mark of social defiance. Spitting may yet return to respectability. 

Just as 'the civilizing process' is seen gradually to build up self-restraint 
within society as a whole, so the training of infants builds up self-restraint 
within adults: 

Thus the sociohistorical process of centuries, in which the standard of what is shameful and offensive 
is slowly raised, is re-enacted in abbreviated form in the life of the individual human being ... One 
could speak, as a parallel to the laws of biogenesis, of a fundamental law of sociogenesis and 
psychogenesis . 4 

Critics of this 'civilizing' theory might object to such a narrow definition of 
civilization. Some might think it a peculiarly German theory-all tidy habits 
and empty heads. Many would insist that the art of savoir vivre demands 
rather more than the ability to control one's spittle, sphincter, and silverware. 
The 'civilisation curves' of Norbert Elias and his theory of unilinear progress 
will not convince everyone. But all would admit to the gulf which separates 
so-called 'Western civilized man' from medieval modes of behaviour, where 
modern concepts of hygiene, of individual respect, of privacy, and of 
'personal space' were virtually absent. One has only to ponder some other 
assorted medieval injunctions: 

It is bad manners ... to wear a helmet when serving ladies. 

Don't blow your nose with the fingers you hold the meat with. 

If you have to scrape [the back of] your throat, do so politely with your 

Farts may be concealed by coughing. [coat 

Before you sit down, make sure that your seat has not been fouled. 

It is impolite to greet someone who is urinating or defecating. 

When you eat, do not forget the poor. God will reward you. 5 


EL CID 

The knight Rodrigo Diaz died in Valencia in 1099. In history he had spent a 
lifetime fighting both for the Moors and against them. But in legend he was 




elevated by the Arabic epithet of al-sayyid or El Cid, 'the Master'; and he 
was turned into the spotless champion of the Christian cause, the national 
hero of Castile. The legend was already flourishing a century later, in the 
epic romance of El Canto del mio Cid. 1 (See Appendix III, p. 1241.) 

The transformation of historical figures into the special status of national 
heroes is a much more complicated process than the mere glorification of 
famous men or women. It is part of the search for a collective identity that 
can only be defined in distinction to hostile neighbours or oppressors. In 
England, whose history is peculiarly lacking in external invaders, the only 
possible candidate was Robin Hood, the shadowy outlaw who defended the 
common people against the Anglo-Norman barons. 2 Among England's 
neighbours the national heroes, whether Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, William 
Wallace the 'Braveheart', Hugh O'Neill, or Joan of Arc, could only be 
figures who fought the English. In later British history, British national 
heroes could only be military figures who, like Admiral Nelson or the Duke 
of Wellington, saved the empire from its foreign foes. In Albania, George 
Castriota (known as 'Skanderbeg', 1403-67) was seen, like El Cid, as the 
symbol of resistance to the Ottomans, although he too had both joined and 
deserted the Ottoman and the Muslim cause. 

The cult of national heroes became obligatory when Romanticism 
collided with Nationalism in the nineteenth century (see p. 815). Nations 
who lacked an established ancient champion adopted more recent ones: 
Koaciuszko, Kossuth, and Shamil fought against the Russians; Andreas 
Hofer in Tyrol against the French; Janosik, the 'Robin Hood of the Tatras', 
against the Austrians. On the northern side of the Tatras, Janosik is the hero 
of the Polish highlanders: on the southern side, the national hero of 
Slovakia. 3 It is fair comment on the state of European identity to recall that, 
as yet, there is no national hero or heroine of Europe. 


All these innovations contributed to what scholars have called the 'Twelfth- 
Century Renaissance'-the moment when, in the setting of enhanced confidence 
and prosperity, Western Christendom consciously sought to put its ideals into 
practice. Events such as the Investiture Contest or the Crusades were not just 
evidence of new energies; they were 'ideological'. A thirst for knowledge was 




inherent in the new mentality. A marked increase in the production of books and 
the collection of libraries took place in recognized intellectual centres. The Latin 
classics were lionized; the Latin language was pruned and refined; Latin poetry 
came into fashion, high and low: 

Meum est propositum in taberna mori, 

Ut sint vina proxima morientis ori. 

Tune cantabunt letius angelorum chori: 

'Sit Deus propitius huic potatori.' 

(My resolution is to die in the tavern. May wine be near my dying lips. Then the angelic choirs will gaily 
sing: 'May God show mercy on this boozer.')- 


All manner of history-writing was undertaken, from simple annals and lives of 
the saints to sophisticated treatises such as Guibert de NogentY De pignoribus 
sanctorum (c.1119), William of Malmesbury's Gesta regum (1120), or Otto von 
Freising's Gesta (c.1156) relating the exploits of Emperor Frederick I. In his 
fantastic Historia Regnum Britanniae (c.1136), Geoffrey of Monmouth 
assembled an imaginative collection of stories and legends from the Celtic past, 
which would be quarried and embellished by numerous poets and troubadours. 
The systematization of Canon Law, notably in the Decretum (1141) of Gratian of 
Bologna, accompanied the study of Roman law by a long line of glossators 
starting with Irnerius (fl . c.1130). Latin translations from Arabic and ancient 
Greek proliferated, by such scholars as Adelard of Bath or Burgundio di Pisa. 
Schools of law, medicine, and general learning flourished at Salerno, 
Montpellier, and, above all, at Bologna. North of the Alps, cathedral schools, as 
at Chartres or Paris, competed with the earlier monastic centres, where St 
Anselm of Aosta (1033-1109), sometime Abbot of Bee and Archbishop of 
Canterbury, had been a seminal figure. At Palermo in Sicily and Toledo in Spain 
the wisdom of the ancients, preserved by Arab scholars, was finally transmitted 
to Christendom. The commentaries of Averroes of Cordoba (Ibn Rushd, 1126- 
98) turned Aristotle into the philosopher of the Middle Ages. Muslim Spain gave 
Europe decimal numbers and mathematical expertise, [xativah] 

Courtly literature was composed in reaction against the boorish lifestyle of 
the barons and the stifling ethics of the Church. Initially, there were two main 
centres-at the northern French courts, which popularized the chansons de geste 
celebrating the exploits of Frankish and Arthurian chivalry, and at the court of 
Aquitaine at Poitiers, which specialized in the chansons d'amor, the songs of 


'courtly love'. The former, which was most productive in the decades after 1120, 
depended heavily on the cult of Charlemagne, especially in epics such as La 
Chanson de Roland and its derivatives-the Pelerinage de Charlemagne or La 
Prise d'Orange. The latter, which came into prominence after 1170, elaborated a 
stylized code of behaviour recorded in the thirty-one articles of De Arte Honeste 
AmanaX 'the Art of Honest Love', drawn up by one Andreas Capellanus. These 
rules, which gave the lead to the dompna or 'mistress' of the knight's affections, 
reversed the accepted gender roles of the day and flouted matrimonial 
conventions. 'Marriage', said Andreas, 'is no barrier to Love.' The genre may 
well have had its origins in Muslim Spain; but it was taken up by troubadours 
across the south, whence it spread to the trouveres of the north and the 
Minnesingers of Germany. 'Love', wrote one of the authors of Tristan, 'is 
stronger than laws.' The acknowledged master of courtly romance, however, was 
Chretien de Troyes (c. 1135-90), a native of Champagne, author of the Arthurian 
trilogy- Yvain, ou le Chevalier au Lion, Lancelot, ou le Chevalier a la 
Charrette, and Perceval, ou le Conte du Graal. [Tristan] 


XATIVAH 

The art and craft of paper-making was first recorded in Europe in 1144 in 
the small Moorish town of Xativah, now San Felipe, near Valencia. It had 
taken 1,000 years to cross Eurasia from China, via Samarkand and Cairo. 
Important technical developments, including dipping moulds and 
watermarks, were pioneered a century later in Italy, most probably at 
Fabriano near Ancona. The first known watermark was a large F (for 
Fabriano). 

From there paper spread far and wide, gradually replacing the older 
writing materials of papyrus, parchment, and pergamon. Early paper-mills 
were built at Ambert in Auvergne (1326), Troyes (1338), Nurnberg (1390), 
Leira in Portugal (1411), Hertford in England (mid-fourteenth-century), 
Constantinople (1453), Cracow (1491), and Moscow (1565). The demand 
for paper was greatly increased by the arrival of printing, [press] 

Standard paper sizes were introduced in Bologna in 1389: Imperial (22 x 
30 inches), Royal, Medium, and Chancery. Book pages were made by 




folding sheets double (folio), twice (quarto), or three times (octavo). In 1783 
the Montgolfier brothers, who owned a paper-works at Annonay, constructed 
their hot-air balloon from paper. But paper's supreme contribution lay in the 
dissemination of knowledge. 'Hail to the inventor of paper,' wrote Herder, 
'who did more for literature than all the monarchs on earth.' 

Handcrafted paper still has its enthusiasts today. There is an International 
Association of Paper Historians, with their journal based in Germany, and a 
score of paper museums. Antique paper-mills still function at Fabriano, at 
Moulin Ricard-en-Bas in France, at Koog aan de Zaan in the Netherlands, at 
Niederzwonitz in Germany, at St Alban in Basle, Switzerland, and at 
Duszniki Zdroj in Silesia. 1 


The German Empire's struggle with the Papacy had always been complicated 
by Italian politics. But in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the problems 
became hopelessly entangled, and all parties to the conflict were seriously 
weakened. Apart from the Hildebrandine ideology of the Popes, the German 
emperors had to contend with the centrifugal tendencies of the tribal duchies, 
especially Saxony; with the dynastic rivalries within Germany, especially that of 
the Guelphs and the Hohenstaufen; with the sturdy independence of the 
Lombard cities; with the wayward city of Rome; and with the distant kingdom of 
the Sicilies. The road to imperial power, therefore, was strewn with hurdles. 
Contenders had first to win the support of the German nobles and bishops, and to 
win election as king in Germany. After that, there was a similar challenge to win 
the crown of Italy. Only then could they move into the end-game and seek 
imperial coronation by the Pope. For over a century this obstacle course 
consumed the energies of three forceful generations from the House of 
Hohenstaufen von Weiblingen- Frederick I Barbarossa, Henry VI, and the 
inimitable Frederick II. 

Barbarossa (r. 1155-90), son of the Hohenstaufen Duke of Swabia and of a 
Guelph princess from Bavaria, was married to the heiress of the Franche-Comte 
and Aries, where he was crowned King. Hence, whilst enjoying an extensive 
power-base of his own, he was able to reconcile the warring German dukes. His 
chief Guelph rival, Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony and Bavaria, was eventually 
mined by a trial before the imperial court which stripped him of his main 
possessions. But a clash at the Diet of Besan^on in 1157, where the papal legate 




described the imperial crown as an ecclesiastical 'benefice', revived the 
Investiture Contest. And a second clash at the Diet of Roncaglia in 1158, where 
the imperial party stressed the seniority of the podesta or 'imperial governor' 
over all other officials in the cities of the Empire, fuelled the endless wars of the 
Lombard leagues. Barbarossa re-enacted all the travails of his predecessors- 
excommunication by the Pope, the election of an antipope, feudal revolts in 
Germany, conflict in Rome, and six wearying Italian expeditions. On 24 July 
1177, in the porch of St Mark's, Venice, and on the centenary of Canossa, he fell 
on his knees before Pope Alexander III and obtained absolution. But, like 
Canossa, it was just a gesture. His master-stroke was to marry his son and heir, 
Henry (r. 1190-97), to the Norman heiress of Sicily, Constanza di Apulia. In 
1186 he saw the young pair wed in Milan, which he had once reduced in a 
terrible siege eighteen years before. Confident of splitting the Papacy from its 

Sicilian allies, he departed with the Third Crusade, and never returned, 
[CONSPIRO] 

Barbarossa's grandson, Frederick II (r. 1211-50), was the offspring of the 
Sicilian connection. He inherited the personal union of Sicily with the Empire as 
established by his parents, and so cherished his Sicilian kingdom that he would 
be accused of neglecting the rest of his realms. Crusader, linguist, philosopher, 
ornithologist, patron of the arts, protector of Jews, and master of a harem, 
Frederick II was twice excommunicated by the Pope for disobedience and 
officially condemned by a General Council as a heretic. He ruled in the south as 
a despot, imposing an efficient, centralized administration on Church and State 
alike. He even encouraged an imperial cult of his own person. He presided over 
a brilliant, cultured court at Palermo-a magnificent blend of Latin, German, 
Jewish, Greek, and Saracen elements. To his contemporaries he was quite simply 
the stupor mundi, the 'wonder of the age'. 

However, to rule the whole of a disparate feudal empire by autocratic 
meanswas impossible, and beyond Naples and Sicily Frederick II was repeatedly 
obliged to make concessions to keep the imperial party intact. In Germany, after 
granting a charter of liberties to the Church (1220), he relinquished direct control 
of ecclesiastical lands in the hope of ruling through prelates such as Archbishop 
Engelbert of Cologne. As a result, he did succeed in having his son, Henry VII, 
elected King of the Romans. At the Diet of Worms in 1231 he ordered Henry to 
promulgate a Statutum in favorem principum, whereby the secular princes were 
granted the same far-reaching liberties as the bishops. In the East, he granted 
unlimited rights to his old crusading companion, Hermann von Salza, the first 



Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, who repeatedly tried to mediate on his 
behalf in Rome. In northern Italy his attempts to consolidate a dominant 
Ghibelline party were constantly thwarted by the spoiling tactics of the popes, 
especially Gregory IX (1227-41), and the league of Lombard cities. 


CONSPIRO 

The League of the Holy Court, or Heilige Fehme, has the distinction of 
being Europe's senior secret society-except for those which remained 
secret. It came into prominence in Germany, during the disorders which 
followed the imperial ban placed on Henry the Lion, chief of the Guelph 
party, in the late twelfth century. Its aim was to administer justice wherever 
imperial authority had collapsed and, by means of forest tribunals, 
administered by Freischoffen or francs-juges, to hold the populace in fear. 
The League had an elite caste of initiates, the Wissenden or 'sages', an 
elaborate system of oaths, signs, and rituals, and a hierarchical structure 
headed by the Oberststuhlherr -originally the Archbishop of Cologne. By 
the fourteenth century, it possessed 100,000 members. Its activities in 
Westphalia were officially recognized. In the fifteenth century, having 
recruited the Emperor Sigismund himself, its influence did not wane until 
the legal reforms of the 1490s. Its last meeting was held in 1568. 

The Femgerichte (forest courts) followed exact procedures, hearing 
witnesses for prosecution and defence. But death was their only sentence. 
The condemned person was left hanging from a tree into which was stuck a 
knife bearing the mystical letters SSGG (standing for Stein, Strick, Gras, 
Griin -'Stone', 'Rope', 'Grass', 'Green'). 

Secret societies can be classified as political, religious, social, and criminal, 
though the categories have often overlapped. In the early seventeenth 
century, the mystical Brotherhood of the Rosicrucians chose to reveal its 
existence. Its occult theosophy was systematized by the Englishman Robert 
Fludd (1574-1637). It attracted considerable interest all over northern 
Europe, from Bacon and Descartes among others, and exercised an 
important influence on the early stages of Freemasonry [mason]. 




Between 1776-85 the short-lived Order of Luminaries of Adam 
Weishaupt professed very advanced projects of social reform in Bavaria. Its 
members had close connections both with Freemasons and even with the 
Jacobins. The early nineteenth century saw the rise of the Carbonari (see p. 
823), the Mafia, and the secret societies of Ireland. Some are still in 
existence. 1 [orange] 

Conspiracy theories of history are not fashionable. But European history 
has never known a shortage of conspiratorial societies, conspiracies, or 
conspirators. 


Frederick was living in a maelstrom that was not entirely of his own making. 
A papal ward in his youth, he had only been given Sicily on papal lease, and he 
was only raised to the Empire at the end of a twenty-year baronial war in 
Germany, where the Pope took against the previous incumbent and papal client, 
Otto of Brunswick. He was not present at the fateful battle of Bouvines in 
Flanders, when the French crushed Otto's anti-papal coalition. It was an irony of 
the political carousel that the Papacy would then take against him. In 1235 he 
restored order in Germany by force, banishing his elder son Henry in favour of 
the younger Conrad. In 1236-7 he crushed the Lombard cities at Cortenuova and 
marched through Cremona with a parade of elephants. In 1241, having sunk a 
papal fleet off Genoa, he took a bevy of hostile archbishops and abbots hostage. 
But in 1248, after the abortive siege of Parma, he lost his harem. No power on 
earth, it seems, could have restrained the partisan hatreds of Guelph and 
Ghibelline. 

After Frederick's death, his son, Conrad IV (r. 1250-4), and grandson, 
Conradin (d. 1268), failed to enforce the Hohenstaufen succession, and the 
Empire was crippled once again by an extended interregnum (1254-73). The 
Papacy promptly reclaimed its overlordship of Sicily, which was turned over to 
the French Angevins. The popes, nominally victorious, were being pushed ever 
closer towards dependence on the kingdom of France. Under Gregory X 
(Tedaldo Visconti, 1271-6), arrangements were finalized for ensuring swift and 
effective papal elections, [conclave] 

It was France which benefited most from the Empire's distress. In the 
eleventh century the Capetian kings had been masters only of the tiny royal 
domain in the lie de France round Paris; elsewhere, the prerogatives of kingship 




had been virtually abandoned to the constituent fiefs. But as from Louis VI (r. 
1108-37) a series of long-lived monarchs greatly enhanced the substance of 
France. In this they were assisted by a remarkable demographic boom, especially 
in the northern provinces, by the growth of prosperous communes, and by 
important territorial acquisitions, notably in the Midi. Louis VII (r. 1137-80) was 
strong enough to marshal the entire nobility of France for the Second Crusade, 
and later to leave the realm in peace during private pilgrimages to Compostela 
and to Canterbury. 

After repudiating his queen, Eleanor of Aquitaine, who promptly married his 
vassal, Henry II of England, he was mortified to watch the assemblage of a rival 
Plantagenet realm stretching from the Scottish borders to the Pyrenees. But the 
crisis passed; and the Capetians were to recover their supremacy. (See Appendix 
III, p. 1244.) [GOTHIC] 

In this period, French and English affairs remained intimately entangled. The 
Angevin or 'Plantagenet 5 Dynasty came into being through the Anglo-Norman 
marriage of William the Conqueror's granddaughter, Matilda, with Geoffrey 
Plantagenet, Count of Anjou. Their son, Henry II (r. 1154-89) put an end to the 
prevailing anarchy of Stephen's reign, and stayed long enough with his queen, 
Eleanor, to procreate a line of monarchs that were to hold the English throne 
until 1399. His reign was marked by judicial reform, by the English invasion of 
Ireland, by incessant travelling to all points between Northumberland and 
Gascony, and by a conflict between Church and State culminating in the murder 
of Archbishop Becket (1170). His elder surviving son, Richard Coeur de Lion (r. 
1189-99) was totally preoccupied with crusading. Richard's brother, John 
Lackland (r. 1199-1216) lost his subjects' trust through repeated acts of tyranny, 
lost the Duchy of Normandy through defeat at the Battle of Bouvines (1214), 
and lost the initiative in English politics through the concessions of Magna 
Carta (1215). John's son, Henry III (r. 1216-72) was a long survivor, relegated 
by Dante To the limbo of ineffectual souls'. (See Appendix III, p. 1252.) 

Those early Plantagenet decades also saw the initial English incursions into 
Ireland. A band of Anglo-Norman adventurers led by Richard 'Strongbow', Earl 
of Pembroke, conspired to support the deposed king of Leinster. Their mailed 
knights made such advances following their landings in Wexford in 1169 that 
Henry II felt obliged to follow them and to receive the joint homage of the 
leading Irish kings. From then on, the English never left. John Lackland obtained 
the title of Dominus Hiberniae, 'Lord of Ireland', in his father's lifetime. In 1210 



he set up a regular English colony at Dublin, forming a cluster of counties 
governed by English law and by English justiciars. Under Henry III, the first 
discriminatory moves were made to legally separate the newcomers from the 
natives and to exclude the Irish from positions of power. 

Eleanor of Aquitaine (1122-1204) was perhaps the outstanding personality 
of the age. She made her mark not only as a woman of remarkable spirit but as a 
political and cultural patron of immense influence. She was the indomitable 
heiress to a great duchy. Married at 15, she had to be brought back from the 
Second Crusade under arrest for defying her royal husband. Divorced at 28, she 
remarried within two months, having engineered the dynastic coup of the 
century. Separated in her late forties through her second husband's liaison with 
the Fair Rosamund of Godstow, she returned to rule in style in her native 
Poitiers. Among her children and grandchildren, she lived to see one emperor, 
three kings of England, kings of Jerusalem and Castile, a duke of Brittany, and 
another queen of France. At Poitiers, at the head of a like-minded band of ladies, 
she became 'the Queen of the Troubadours': 

Domna vostre sui e serai, 

Del vostre servizi garnitz. 

Vostr'om sui juratz e plevitz, 

E vostre m'era des abans. 

E vos etz lo meus jois primers, 

E si seretz vos lo derrers, 

Tan com la vida m'er durans. 

(Lady, I'm yours and yours shall be, I Vowed to your service constantly. I This is 
the oath of fealty 11 pledged to you this long time past. I As my first joy was all 
in you, I So shall my last be found there too, I So long as life in me shall last.)- 

Hostile French comment tried to blacken Eleanor's reputation with tales of 
poisoning and incest. But she stands as the central figure in the cultural history 
of a land which her enemies were about to destroy. 

For Aquitaine formed the central sector of a distinct cultural and linguistic 
region now known as Occitania. The langue d'oc, whose speakers said oc for 
'yes', was quite separate from the langue d'o'il the 'French' language of northern 
Gaul. It was spoken right across the Midi from Catalonia to Provence. It 
transcended all poUtical frontiers from the Kingdom of Aragon to the Arelate 
(Kingdom of Burgundy-Aries), which still belonged to the Empire. In the twelfth 


and early thirteenth centuries, on the eve of the French advance, it was the scene 
of one of Europe's most brilliant civilizations. 

Philippe-Auguste (r. 1180-1223) gave the French monarchy its decisive 
impetus. Whilst tripling the size of the royal domain, he drew great advantage by 
playing off the rivalries of Empire and Papacy. He laid the foundations of a 
national army and, through the system of baillis or royal bailiffs, of a centralized 
administration. He was then able to withstand the eternal intrigues of the tenants- 
in-chief, and to destroy the Plantagenet challenge. Having stripped John 
Lackland of his legal rights in France through charges of breaching feudal 
obligation, he followed up the courtroom's decision with the sword. From 1202 
he smoothly annexed Normandy, Anjou, Touraine, and most of Poitou. In 1214, 
at Bouvines, where he was unhorsed and saved by his vassals, he destroyed 
France's imperial and Plantagenet foes on the same field. 

His grandson, Louis IX (r. 1226-70), gave France the moral prestige which 
military and economic success could not. Having inherited the extended 
kingdom which his father, Louis VIII, had just secured in Aquitaine and 
Languedoc, he did not need to wage war on his neighbours. He personified the 
highest ideals of a Christian king, as then conceived, and his life by Jean, Sire de 
Joinville, presents an entrancing portrait. 'Mon cher fils,' he told his eldest son, 
'I beg you to love the people ... For in truth, I would prefer that a Scotsman 
should... govern the people well and loyally, than that you should be seen to rule 
the kingdom badly.'- Louis had spent his youth under the regency of his mother, 
Eleanor's grand-daughter, Blanche of Castile, when a dangerous feudal reaction 
arose. But his integrity and his limitless bank of marriageable relatives drew the 
great fiefs back into partnership with the Crown. In an age of intense 
litigiousness, he was the chosen arbiter of many a royal or feudal dispute, 
dispensing justice under the Oak of Vincennes. His treatment of the Jews and of 
the Midi was less than saintly. Yet towards the end of his long reign, St Louis 
was without contest the first prince of Christendom. 


GOTHIC 


Visitors to the abbey of St Denis near Paris are shown the pointed arches 
in the apse which Abbot Suger completed in 1143 or 1144, and which are 





said to have initiated the Gothic style. Whether or not the work at St Denis 
preceded the Gothic vaulting at the cathedral of Sens, which was under 
construction during the same years, is a matter for debate. But France's 
senior basilica, the site of numerous royal coronations and burials and home 
of the oriflamme, would be a fitting place for such a momentous event; and 
it certainly preceded both Notre-Dame de Paris, the masterpiece of the 
'transitional style', and the glories of Chartres, Reims, and Amiens. 

From its beginnings in France, the Gothic spread far and wide 
throughout the Catholic world to become the archetypal style for medieval 
church-building north of the Alps. Scores of Gothic cathedrals were built, 
from Seville in the west to Dorpat in the east, from Lund in the north to 
Milan in the south. They were imitated in thousands of parish churches. 

Many experts would argue that the ultimate aesthetic effect was achieved 
at the Sainte-Chapelle, which was completed in Paris on the orders of St 
Louis on 25 April 1248. Smaller than the great cathedrals, it is an edifice of 
exquisite delicacy and light, its tall, slender windows filled with brilliant 
expanses of stained glass. 

Far away, the castle chapel of the Holy Trinity in Lublin, between Vistula 
and Bug, is one of those cultural orientation points which enable one to see 
Europe as a whole. Built in pure Gothic style by King Wladystaw Jagiello 
(d. 1434), for a Polish-Lithuanian capital that never developed, it is a distant, 
mstic echo of the Sainte-Chapelle. At the same time, like the neighbouring 
Gothic cathedral of Sandomierz, its interior walls were painted in rich 
Byzantine splendour with murals designed by artists imported either from 
Ruthenia or possibly from Ottoman-occupied Macedonia. It lies at the point 
where the architecture of the West coincides with the decorative style of the 
East. The date of its completion is recorded, at the end of a long Cyrillic 
dedication in Old Church Slavonic, as St Lawrence's Day, 1418. 

The career of the Gothic style did not end, however, with medieval 
church-building. It was revived as the favourite architectural style of the 
Romantic era, which sought to recover its prestigious aesthetic appeal and to 
apply it to all manner of secular structures. Manchester City Hall, King 
Ludwig's fantasy castle at Neuschwanstein in Bavaria, and the Austrian 
waterworks in Cracow are all descendants of Abbot Suger's apse at the 
terminus of Metro Line 13. 

All modern interpretations of Gothic style are coloured by those 



nineteenth-century enthusiasms. The theories of Schlegel, Ruskin, and 
Viollet-le-Duc were as crude as their propensity for 'improving' the 
medieval originals, including St Denis. From being a term of 'unmitigated 
contempt' for 'savageness', to use Ruskin's words, Gothic became the object 
of unrestrained adulation. 1 Goethe's essay 'Von deutscher Baukunst' (On 
German Architecture), which mythologized the origins of Strasbourg 
Cathedral and its builder, Erwin von Steinbach, was an inspiration to many 
others. In due course it tempted German scholars to claim Gothic as their 
own. In fact, Gothic was one of the most international of styles, with 
numerous regional variants. It is one of the many strands on which theories 
about the unity of European culture might easily be built. 2 


In England, a normal baronial war produced an abnormal outcome. Henry III 
Plantagenet (r. 1216-72), Lackland's son, had made himself unpopular with his 
barons by giving preference to his Poitevin, Savoyard, and Lusignan relatives, 
by an unsuccessful French war, and by extravagant building projects such as the 
renovation of Westminster Abbey. In 1258 a reforming faction emerged under 
the leadership of Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, son of the Albigensian 
crusader (see below). By withholding a grant to solve the King's financial 
problems, the reformers pushed through the Provisions of Oxford whereby the 
King's administration was to be supervised by their nominees. When the King 
reneged, Simon waged war, and in the battle of Lewes succeeded in capturing 
the King, the King's eldest son, and the King's brother, Richard of Cornwall, 
King of Germany. In the following year the royal party rallied, and Simon was 
slain at Evesham (1265). In the interval, in January 1265, a new sort of 
Parliament had been summoned-not just from the magnates and prelates, but 
from the knights of the shires and from the burgesses of selected boroughs. For 
constitutionalists it was an important precedent, a decisive step on the road to 
limited monarchy-the first appearance of the House of Commons. 

Yet it is doubtful whether England or France had any sense of their later 
national identities. In the thirteenth century the kingdom of England was still 
bound up with its Continental possessions. Its ruling class was still tied to the 
culture and ambitions of their French relations. France itself had only just 
acquired the territorial base, from the Channel to the Mediterranean, on which its 
future fortunes would be forged. There were many things about England which 




were considerably more 'French' than many parts of the new France. 

The obsession with the recovery of the Holy Land lasted for 200 years and ended 
in failure. Between 1096 and 1291 there were seven major Crusades and 
numerous minor ones. The First Crusade (1096-9), led by the barons Godfroi de 
Bouillon, Raymond de St Gilles, Count of Toulouse, and Hugues de Vermandois, 
brother of the King of France, succeeded in capturing Jerusalem, massacring its 
inhabitants, and establishing a Latin kingdom in Palestine. The Second Crusade 
(1147-9), preached by St Bernard and led jointly by Louis VII of France and 
Conrad III of Germany, achieved little except the incidental seizure of Lisbon 
from the Moors by an English fleet. The Third Crusade (1189-92), mounted by 
the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, Philippe Auguste of France, and Richard 
Cceur de Lion of England, failed to retake Jerusalem. The Fourth Crusade 
(1202-4), diverted by the ambitions of the Doge of Venice, succeeded in 
capturing Constantinople, massacring its inhabitants, and establishing a Latin 
empire in Byzantium-which was not the point of the exercise. The Fifth (1218- 
21), Sixth (1248-54), and Seventh (1270) Crusades ended up in Egypt or in 
Tunis, where St Louis of France himself died of the plague. When the last 
Christian stronghold in the Holy Land fell at Acre in 1291, there was no 
coherent response. 

The conduct of the Crusaders was shocking-not only to modern 
sensibilities, but equally to contemporaries. St Bernard himself was moved to 
denounce it. They ravaged the countries through which they marched- 
Bohemia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Byzantium. In 1096 they killed up to 8,000 
Jews in their progress through the Rhineland-the first major series of Europe's 
pogroms. Their naval expeditions devastated the Mediterranean ports. They 
fought among themselves no less than against the Infidel. They fleeced their 
subjects to fill their coffers. T will sell the city of London', said Richard Cceur 
de Lion, 'if I can find a buyer.' The cost in wasted lives and effort was 
incalculable. One German emperor was drowned in a river in Cilicia; a second 
held the King of England to ransom; a third was excommunicated as he set sail 
for Palestine. Murder and massacre in the service of the Gospel were 
commonplace. Seventy thousand civilians were said to have been butchered in 
cold blood in the initial sack of Jerusalem. 'The lives and labours of millions 
who were buried in the East, would have been more profitably employed in the 
improvement of their native country.'- 'Arguably, the only fmit of the Crusades 


kept by the Christians was the apricot.'- 

Yet the horrors along the crusaders' road often mask the deeper causes of 
their motivation. Religious fervour was mixed with the resentments of a society 
suffering from waves of famine, plague, and overpopulation. Crusading was a 
means to sublimate the pains of an indigent existence. In this, the well-fed knight 
with his well-shod retinue was far outnumbered by the hordes of paupers who 
followed in his wake. The 'People's Crusades' and 'Shepherds' Crusades' 
continued long after the major expeditions. For them, Jerusalem was the 
visionary city of Revelation, where Christ beckoned. The Crusades were 'an 
armed pilgrimage', 'a collective imitatio Christi, a mass sacrifice which was to 
be rewarded by a mass apotheosis at Jerusalem', the inspiration of 'the 
messianism of the poor'.- Successful crusaders of the knightly caste might be 
portrayed in stone in their parish church, their legs piously crossed in death. 
Most of their companions never came home, presumed dead. Of course, the 
concept of crusading was not limited to the Holy Land. The Latin Church gave 
equal weight to the northern crusades in the Baltic (see pp. 362-4) and to the 
'third flank' in the Reconquista in Spain (see p. 345). 

The impact of the Crusades was profound. The Latin kingdom of Jerusalem 
(1099-1187) was the first experiment in a 'Europe Overseas'.- The eastern 
Mediterranean was reopened to trade and travel. The Italian cities, especially 
Venice and Genoa, flourished. The collective identity of the Latin Church was 
consolidated under papal leadership. The Crusades supplied a vast fund of 
heroism and curiosity which underlay the growth of medieval romance, 
philosophy, and literature. Yet the Crusades also served to strengthen the nexus 
between Western Christendom, feudalism, and militarism. They gave rise to the 
military orders. Through the misconduct of the Latins, and the disgust of the 
Greeks who witnessed the misdeeds, they rendered the reunification of 
Christendom virtually impossible. Above all, they reinforced the barriers 
between Christianity and Islam, poisoning relations in which Westerners were 
cast in the role both of aggressors and of losers. In short, the Crusaders brought 
Christianity into disrepute. 

The military orders, especially the Hospitallers and the Templars, were 
central to the debate on crusading ethics. The 'Knights of the Order of the 
Hospital of St John of Jerusalem' were created in 1099 after the first Crusade. 
They included military, medical, and pastoral brothers. After the fall of Acre 
they escaped to Cyprus, ruled Rhodes (1309-1522), and eventually Malta 


(1530-1801). The 'Poor Knights of Christ and the Temple of Solomon' came 
into being in 1118 for the purpose of protecting pilgrims on the road to 
Jerusalem. They diversified, however, into banking and real estate, growing 
immensely rich from properties all over Christendom. They were suppressed in 
1312 on false charges of magic, sodomy, and heresy brought against them by the 
King of France. Their emblem, two knights riding on one horse, goes back to the 
first Master, Hugues de Payens, who was so poor that he shared his horse with a 
friend. It was a curious bent of the medieval mind that men could reconcile 
monastic vows with soldiering. Both the Hospitallers and the Templars were 
international bodies with depots in all the countries of the West. The Teutonic 
Knights, in contrast, were diverted at an early stage to the Baltic (see below). 
The military orders of Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcantara did not operate outside 
Spain. 

The double conquest of Constantinople in 1203-4 well illustrates the 
doubtful virtues of the crusading movement. The army of the Fourth Crusade, 
which had congregated at Venice, soon fell prey to the schemes of the ageing 
Doge Enrico Dandolo and of the German King Philip of Swabia, who was 
married to Irene of Byzantium. The Doge saw a chance to enlarge the Republic's 
possessions in the Levant; the King saw a chance to restore his exiled nephew to 
the Byzantine throne. So, in return for the hire of a fleet, the Crusaders had to 
agree to share their booty with the Venetians and to back the restoration of 
Alexius IV. In addition, when they failed to pay for their ships, they were obliged 
to seize the Hungarian port of Zara in Dalmatia as collateral. In July 1203 they 
sailed through the Dardanelles without resistance and stormed the sea-walls. But 
a palace revolution in Constantinople, where Alexius IV was strangled, robbed 
them of their victory; and in April they had to repeat the exercise. This time the 
city of Constantine was comprehensively ransacked, the churches pillaged, the 
citizens butchered, the icons smashed. Baldwin, Count of Flanders, was crowned 
'Basileus' in St Sophia by a Venetian Patriarch. The Empire was parcelled out 
into Venetian colonies and Latin fiefs. At which point, at Adrianople in April 
1205, the crusading army was annihilated by the Bulgars. They never came 
within a thousand miles of Jerusalem. They had committed 'the Great 
Betrayal'.- 

The Fourth Crusade left two Roman Empires in the East: the Latin 'Empire 
of the Straits' at Constantinople and the Byzantine rump ruled from Nicaea in 
Asia Minor. The former survived for sixty years until, in 1261, in the temporary 
absence of the Venetian fleet, the latter recovered its position. In the long run, 


Venice was the sole beneficiary. 


None the less, the fiasco of the Fourth Crusade coincided with what many regard 
as the political apogee of the Latin Church-the Papacy of Innocent III (1198- 
1216). Born Lotario d'Anagni, Innocent was an instinctive power-broker who 
came nearest to the ideal of subordinating all rulers to 'theocratic government'. 
In Germany he contrived both to crown one of the imperial contenders, Otto of 
Brunswick, and then to depose him. In France he refused to approve Philippe- 
Auguste's matrimonial arrangements and, having placed the country under 
interdict, eventually forced the King to restore his Queen after a twenty-year 
separation. In England, after another lengthy struggle with King John, he again 
wielded the interdict and forced the King to submit. England joined Aragon, 
Sicily, Denmark, and even Bulgaria as vassals of the Holy See. The Xllth 
General Council of the Church, which convened in the Lateran in November 
1215, saw 1,500 prelates from all over Christendom meekly adopting the Pope's 
proposals. 

In reality, the Latin Church was rather more influential in high politics than 
in the lives of ordinary men and women. The hierarchy was often out of touch 
with the people. Heresy, pagan reversions, fantastic superstitions, and fierce 
resentments of the Church's wealth were prevalent. To combat the crisis, 
Innocent III gave his blessing to two new orders of mendicant brothers, who 
were to live exemplary lives of communal service among the masses. The Order 
of Preachers (OP), the Black Friars or Dominicans, was founded by a Castilian, 
St Dominic Guzman (1170-1221), who fixed their rule in two general Chapters 
in 1220-1. Ever since they have been specially devoted both to evangelizing and 
to study. The Order of Friars Minor (OFM), the Minorites or Grey Friars, was 
founded by St Francis of Assisi (c. 1181-1226) and received their papal charter 
in 1223. Ever since, they have been specially devoted to moral teaching. Both 
Dominicans and Franciscans accepted men and women, and were sworn to 
corporate and individual poverty. Until further developments were halted in 
1274, they were joined by other mendicants including the Poor Clares, the 
Carmelites or White Friars, and the Austin Friars. Unlike the monks, whose 
piety was sometimes suspect, the 'jovial friar' was as popular with the laity as he 
was unpopular with the high clergy. 

St Francis is undoubtedly the most endearing figure of medieval Christianity. 
Born the son of a rich merchant of Assisi in Umbria, he changed his clothes for 



those of a beggar and renounced his inheritance. He was the 'husband of Lady 
Poverty'. He lived for a time as a hermit in a cave above Assisi, but in 1219 
accompanied a crusading expedition to Egypt. He had more direct influence on 
the foundation of the Poor Clares than of the Franciscans. In 1224, when he was 
praying on Monte Verna, his body was impressed with the Stigmata-scars 
corresponding to the wounds of the crucified Christ. His legendary ability to 
commune with Nature is conveyed in his 'Canticle to the Sun' and in the later 
Fioretti (The Little Flowers of St Francis and his Companions). He was the 
author of hymns and prayers which go to the heart of the Christian ethos: 

Lord, make me an instrument of your peace; 

Where there is hatred, let me sow love, 

Where there is injury, pardon, 

Where there is doubt, faith, 

Where there is despair, hope, 

Where there is darkness, light, 

Where there is sadness, joy. 

O Divine Master, Grant that I may not so much seek 
To be consoled, as to console, 

To be understood, as to understand, 

To be loved, as to love; 

For it is in giving that we receive; 

It is in pardoning that we are pardoned; 

It is in dying that we are born to eternal life.- 

The friars were instrumental in another development of the age-the rise of 
universities. The 'twelfth-century renaissance' had established the principle that 
secular learning had value apart from theology. But it was not acceptable that 
educational institutions should be set up without licence of the Church. Hence 
the idea of a Studium Generate or 'university', divided into four or five faculties 
- Theology, Law, Medicine, Arts or Philosophy, and Music-incorporated by 
charter and regulated by a self-governing academic body. Among Europe's 
senior universities, after Bologna (1088, refounded 1215) came Paris (c.1150) 
and then Oxford 1167). By 1300, a score of foundations had proliferated in Italy, 
France, England, and Spain, with many more to come. (See Appendix III, p. 
1248.) 

The Albigensian Crusade (1209-29) illustrates a very different aspect of 
medieval Christianity. In 1199 Innocent III had declared heresy to be 'treason 



against God'. The target of his fulminations were the Cathars or 'Albigensians' 
of Languedoc. Spiritual descendants of the ancient Gnostics, Manichaeans, and 
Bogumils, the Cathars had left traces of an earlier presence in Bosnia and had 
been the subject of a heresy trial in Milan. They then spread rapidly in the 
weaving towns of Albi, Agen, Pamiers, Carcassonne, and Toulouse, where they 
gained the protection of the local counts. They believed that the prevalence of 
evil contradicted the existence of a sole benign Creator; that good and evil, 
therefore, must be separate creations. They were vegetarian, ascetic, puritanical; 
they practised the equality of men and women; and they supported a caste of 
perfecti who administered the rite of consolamentum, the 'laying on of hands'. In 
1167 they had held a dissident Council, at Saint Felix de Caraman near 
Toulouse, which was in touch with fellow dissidents of the same persuasion in 
Asia Minor. The Xlth General Council of the Church, called in 1179 to discuss 
the problem, had made no progress; and the preaching of St Dominic was 
equally fruitless. In 1209 the murder of a papal legate was used as the pretext for 
launching a general attack, [bogumil] 

Innocent III pronounced a Crusade on the same terms as the Crusades against 
Islam-the remission of sins and unrestricted loot. In the first phase, between 
1209 and 1218,12,000 knights from France and Burgundy, under Simon de 
Montfort the Elder, battled the heretics under the Raymonds VI and VII of 
Toulouse. In the second phase, from 1225 to 1271, the armies of the King of 
France entered the fray. The Cathars faced the choice between abjuration or 
death. Many chose death. The Holy Inquisition, led by a Cathar defector, Robert 
the Bugger,* spread a veritable reign of torture and terror. In 1244, at Montsegur, 
the holy place of the Perfects, 200 recalcitrants were burned alive in one vast 
pyre. Year by year, village by village, by sword and by trial, the extirpation went 
on. The castle of Queribus fell in 1255. By the fourteenth century the surviving 
ex-Cathars found themselves in the Roman Catholic fold. Their province of 
Languedoc found itself in the kingdom of France. The unity of France was built 
on the misery of the Midi.- 

Crusading, however, had further uses. If it could be used against the infidel, 
it could also be used against the heathen nearer to home. In 1147, at Frankfurt, St 
Bernard had found that the Saxon nobles were much keener on attacking their 
Slavonic neighbours than marching to the Holy Land. A papal bull, Divina 
dispensation, was obtained, and St Bernard urged the northern crusaders 'to fight 
the heathen until such time as, by God's help, they shall either be converted or 


wiped out'.- The Wendish Crusade (1147-85) saw Saxons, Danes, and Poles 
reducing the obstinate tribes of Mecklenburg and Lusatia to the Catholic 
obedience. (See Plate 26.) 

In 1198 Hartwig II, Archbishop of Bremen, launched another 'continuous 
crusade' in Livonia. Assisted by an Order of armed German monks, the Brothers 
of the Sword, based at Riga, he created an organization which gradually brought 
all the north-east Baltic under Catholic control. Livonia was subdued by the 
Order, Estonia by the Danes, and Finland by the Swedes. Their exploits were 
recorded c.1295 by the nameless author of the Livlandische Reimchronik, who 
describes the urge to kill and burn in the name of the Lord: 

The first of the fires that burned that day 
Was lit by the hand of a Friar Grey, 

And a Blackfriar followed after.- [dannebrog] 

The Prussian Crusade began in 1230. The Prussians had preserved their 
independence since the days of St Vojtech, and were worrying the local Polish 
princes by their incessant raiding. One of those princes, Konrad Mazowiecki 
(Conrad of Mazovia), determined to solve the problem by calling in a minor 
military Order, the Teutonic Knights, unemployed since their recent expulsion 
from the Holy Land. He was sowing the dragon's teeth: instead of completing 
their contract and departing, the Knights obtained charters of permanent 
crusading rights from both the Emperor and the Pope, and dug in for the 
duration. By playing off their various sponsors, they were able to escape the 
control of all. The bull Pietati proximum (1234), claiming Prussia as a papal fief, 
remained a dead letter, as did a similar imperial decree of 1245 claiming 
Courland, Semigalia, and Lithuania for the Empire. The Knights-Brothers, in 
their white surcoats with black crosses, pressed on regardless, building forts and 
trading posts as they went-Thorn (Torun 1231), Marienwerder (Kwidzyn 
1233), Elbing (Elblag 1237). By 1295, after a final heathen revolt, Prussia had 
become the Teutonic State, an independent crusading enterprise in the heart of 
Europe. 


DANNEBROG 





On 15 June 1219, the Danish expedition to Estonia faced disaster. The 
native Estonians had just submitted to King Valdemar the Victorious, who 
was preparing to baptize them. But they rushed the Danish camp at nightfall, 
killed the bishop, and drove the crusaders towards the sea. According to 
legend, the fate of the battle only turned when the heavens let fall a red 
banner with a white cross, and a voice was heard urging the Danes to rally 
round it. Valdemar triumphed; the city of Tallin or 'Danish Castle', was 
founded; and Denmark adopted the dannebrog or 'red rag' as the national 
flag. 1 

Since then, every independent nation has adopted a flag of its own. 
Many, like the Dannebrog, bear a cross-the red cross of St George in 
England, the diagonal blue cross of St Andrew for Scotland, Sweden's 
yellow cross on a blue ground. Switzerland adopted Denmark's colours, but 
a different cross. The Union Jack of the United Kingdom, which combines 
the crosses of SS George, Andrew, and Patrick, was first flown after the Irish 
Union on 1 January 1801. 

All European monarchies possess a royal standard in addition to the 
national flag. Denmark's royal standard, which carries three lions statant 
azure, with hearts gules, on a field or, pre-dates the Dannebrog. 

Following the example of the Netherlands (1652), most modern 
republics have adopted simple tricolours or bicolours. Some of these, like 
the French (1792), the Italian (1805), or the Irish (1922), are vertical. Others, 
like those of Germany (1918) or Russia (1917), are horizontal. Most have 
had to contend with flags of rival regimes. National flags are a focus for 
patriotism, and a vital symbol of identity. The sequence in which they were 
adopted is not irrelevant to the uneven maturity of Europe's national 
communities. 


The methods and motives of the Teutonic Knights have long been the subject 
of controversy. Their neighbours in Poland and Pomerania, against whom they 
fought incessandy, complained bitterly to the Pope, and later brought the matter 
to the Council of Constance. More sympathetic observers have not seen the 
discrepancy: 




The dominant motive of the Teutonic Knights, as of ail crusaders, was the desire for atonement through 
sacrifice. The method chosen may seem bizarre, especially when contrasted with the ministry of love 
carried on by the Franciscans... but the Teutonic Knights and the Friars ... had this in common: they were 
both trying to achieve redemption and holiness without cutting themselves off from the practical world they 
shared a monastic dedication to an unmonastic way of life.- 

Thus did civilization advance. 

In the thirteenth century Eastern Europe was stormed by invaders who made the 
Teutonic Knights look like laggards. The Mongols of Genghis Khan swept out of 
the Asian steppes like a whirlwind, first in 1207, when Juji, son of Genghis, 
subjugated southern Siberia, and then in 1223, when they ravaged Transcaucasia 
and destroyed a Kievan army on the Kalka River. In 1236-7 Batu Khan, 
grandson of Genghis, crossed the Urals, ravaged the principalities of Ryazan and 
Vladimir, and razed Moscow. He took Kiev by siege in 1240 before moving off 
to the west. In 1241 Galicia was ravaged and Cracow razed. On 9 April 1241 the 
Polish princes under Henry the Bearded were cut to pieces on the field of 
Legnica in Silesia. As proof of their victory the Mongols were said to have 
collected nine sackfuls of right ears from the bodies of the slain. Another column 
of the horde swept on to Hungary, where a similar fate awaited the Magyar 
princes under Bela IV on the river Tisza. Batu then returned eastwards, setting 
up his camp at Saray near the mouth of the Volga. Similar trails of destruction 
were blazed again in 1259 and in 1287. [hejnal] 

The Mongol invasions transformed the face of several countries. The 
horsemen of Batu Khan settled down on the Volga for good. The state of the 
'Golden Horde', which they created between Volga and Don, supplanted that of 
the Volga Bulgars, whose sumptuous capital they razed. The khanates of Kazan 
and Astrakhan, which were eventually to be annexed by Muscovy in 1552-6, put 
an Asiatic population in place that is the basis of modern 'Tatarstan'. The Tartars 
of Crimea established a thriving state from their seat at Bakshishsarai that lived 
for centuries from their czambuls or 'raiding-parties'. Their presence provoked 
the rise of the later Cossack communities of the Dnieper and Don, and long 
delayed the settlement of adjoining Ukraine. 


HEJNAL 





Hejnal, which derives from the Hungarian word for the dawn and, by 
extension for reveille, has passed into the Polish language as a term for the 
trumpet-call which sounds the alarm on the enemy's approach. 

Hejnal krakowski 



Today, the hejnal mariacki or Trumpet-call of St Mary's' is one of the 
many curiosities of old Cracow. It is sounded from the top of the tower of 
the ancient church which overlooks the city square. It is sounded on the 
hour, every hour of the day and night, winter and summer; and each time it is 
repeated four times: to north, south, east, and west. It consists of a simple 
melody of open chords, which is always cut short in the middle of the final 
cadence. It commemorates the trumpeter who, whilst raising the alarm in 
1241, or perhaps in 1259, was shot through the throat by a Mongol arrow. 
His call, though interrupted, enabled the burghers to flee. The survivors 
undertook to endow a town trumpeter in perpetuity. 

The ritual has been maintained for over 700 years, with only short 
interruptions in the nineteenth century, and during the German occupation of 
1939-45. It is older than the church from which it is sounded. The melody 
took its present form in the seventeenth century. After 1945, Polish Radio 
adopted it as a prelude to its daily time signal at twelve noon. It reminds 
millions of listeners both of the ancient pedigree of Polish culture and of 
Poland's exposed location. It is one of the few active mementoes of Genghis 
Khan, and of the irruption of his horsemen into the heart of Europe. 1 

On 25 October 1405 the Swiss city of Lausanne was ravaged by fire. The 
Bishop promptly issued an eleven-point edict on fire precautions. Article 5 
stated that 'at every hour of the night, one of the watchmen on the tower of 
the Cathedral is obliged to shout the hour and to call to the watchmen of the 
city's other wards ... on pain of 6 deniers for every failing.' Six centuries 
later, from 10 o'clock every evening, the watchman's call still echoes to the 
four winds: TI a sonne dix!' 2 

At Ripon in Yorkshire, they say that the 'charter horn' has 'sounded the 



trump' every evening since 886. 


The European Ground and Tower Watch Association was founded in 1987 at 
Ebeltoft in Denmark. Most of its members represent modern revivals. 
Cracow, Lausanne, and Ripon, together with Annaberg, Celle, and 
Nordlingen in Germany, and Ystad in Sweden belong to the select company 
which can claim to have kept the watch 'since the beginning'. 


Poland and Hungary, denuded of much population, were left to recover as 
best they could. In both cases, since a ready supply of colonists was available in 
the German Empire, the Mongol invasions accelerated an existing process of 
migration and colonization. In this period German and Flemish settlers moved 
into Silesia and Pomerania, and also into Transylvania. The princes' 'locators' 
offered land on favourable terms of tenure, and persuaded whole convoys of 
peasant migrants to trek east. At the same time, the cities were rebuilt and 
provided with charters on the model of the Magdeburg or, less frequently, the 
Liibeck Law. The cities of that vintage-Breslau (1242), Buda (1244), Cracow 
(1257) and others- were governed by German law and were full of German 
merchants. Added to the activities in the Baltic both of the Hanseatic League and 
of the Teutonic Knights, these changes brought about a massive increase of 
German influence, [budA] [hansa] 

The Mongols destroyed all semblance of unity among the east Slavs whose 
lands they had subjugated. Some of the princes of Rus' were eventually able to 
escape by turning to their Lithuanian neighbours (see p. 392). But those in the 
East were forced, quite literally, to 'bend the neck'. Summoned at regular 
intervals to the camp of the khan, they were obliged to walk between blazing 
bonfires, to stoop beneath the proffered yoke, and to prostrate themselves before 
their master. It was a ritual humiliation whose purpose was not forgotten. Their 
people were condemned to pay tribute, collected by resident Mongol baskiki or 
'governors'. But the Orthodox Church was not oppressed. It was the period of 
'the Tartar Yoke'. 

There is a description of 'the province of Russia' at this time in the travels of 
the Venetian Marco Polo, whose father had visited the Crimea on a trading 
venture in 1260: 


The province... is of vast extent... and borders upon that northern tract which has been described as the 




Region of Darkness. Its inhabitants are Christians, and follow the Greek ritual... The men are extremely 
well-favoured, tall and of fair complexion; the women are also... of a good size, with light hair which they 
are accustomed to wear long. The country pays tribute to the king of the Western Tartars... Within it are 
collected in great abundance the furs of ermines, sables, martens, foxes ... together with much wax. It 
contains several [silver] mines... [It] is an exceedingly cold region, and I have been assured that it extends 
even as far as the Northern Ocean, where ... peregrine falcons are taken in vast numbers.- 

Contrary to former assumptions, economic life in the Middle Ages was not 
stagnant. There is a school of thought which holds that 'an agricultural 
revolution' in northern Europe at this time was 'equally decisive in its historical 
effects' as 'the so-called Industrial Revolution' of the nineteenth century.- The 
argument centres on new sources of power such as the water-mill and the 
windmill, on expanded mining activities, on the impact of the iron plough and 
horsepower, and on crop rotation and improved nutrition. New techniques 
sometimes took centuries to be widely applied, but the chain effect over time 
was decisive. Agriculture moved into the heavier but more fertile soils of the 
valleys. The increased food supply fuelled a demographic explosion, especially 
in northern France and the Low Countries. The rising population filled the new 
towns and released a new labour force. The labour force could be employed in 
new industrial enterprises such as mining and weaving: specialized textile towns 
proliferated. Sea trade was steadily expanded, [plovum] [murano] 


BUDA 

In 1244, King Bela IV of Hungary granted a charter of autonomy to the I 
'free city of Pest' on the Danube. His decision formed part of a wider 
programme of reconstruction following the recent Tartar invasions. 
Henceforth, the city was to govern itself according to the Law of 
Magdeburg, the king ceding all but residual powers. In due course, similar 
arrangements would be made for the castle suburb of Buda on the opposite 
bank of the river, creating two distinct jurisdictional units within the one 
urban area. 1 Buda, which in German was known as Ofen, succeeded 
Esztergom as Hungary's royal capital in 1361. 

The future life of a city was greatly influenced by the nature of the 
authority which granted its founding charter. Although municipal charters 





granted by kings and princes were most common, bishops were often active, 
especially in Germany. Wherever the nobility was strong, as in Hungary and 
Poland, private cities also sprang up, providing oases of immunity from the 
long arms of Church and State. The growth of cities greatly strengthened the 
centrifugal tendencies of late medieval polities. In Hungary, it complemented 
the existing system of territorial counties and of noble liberties. 

A city's adoption of the Magdeburg model does not necessarily mean 
that it was a German settlement. The Magdeburg Law was adopted all over 
East and Central Europe by German and by non-German cities alike. None 
the less, there was always a strong German community both in Pest and in 
Buda even under Ottoman rule. The twin cities were not joined into one joint 
municipality until 1872, shortly after Hungary re-asserted its separate 
existence within the Habsburgs' dual Monarchy. In 1896, they played host to 
an extravagant festival celebrating the millennium of Hungary's foundation. 

Hungary's Millennium naturally focused on the person of St Stephen and 
on the gift of a crown by the Pope. This event, like the founding of Pest, was 
understood to have cemented the lasting connection with the West. Stephen's 
queen, Gisella, was sister to Henry of Bavaria (the future German Emperor, 
who was also canonized). His coronation in ad 1001 helped him oust his 
Bulgarian- and Orthodox-backed rivals for the throne. From then on, like 
Poland, Hungary was firmly committed to the Western, Catholic camp. 

The crown, which bears St Stephen's name and which is now the prime 
exhibit in the Hungarian National Museum, came to symbolize Hungary's 
extraordinary powers of survival. It was supposedly worn by all the 
Hungarian kings from the Arpads to the Habsburgs, and was a necessary 
adjunct to all valid coronations. It was many times lost or hidden, but never 
destroyed. In -1405 it fell unnoticed into an Austrian bog, whilst being 
illegally exported by Sigismund of Luxembourg, but was recovered when 
the bog started to glow with heavenly rays. In 1945 it was smuggled out of 
the country again, taken to the USA, and secretly deposited in Fort Knox. It 
was returned to Budapest in 1978, even though Hungary was still a 
communist-ruled country. 

It is interesting to find, therefore, that doubts have been raised whether 
'St Stephen's Crown' had ever belonged to St Stephen. Nor, despite later 
attributions, is it likely to have originated in Rome. According to the most 
recent scholarly opinions, the principal gold band, the corona graeca, was 



made in eleventh-century Byzantium, probably for Synadene, consort to 
Geza I (r. 1074-7). In the traditional view, this 'Greek Crown' was welded 
onto an older crown, the corona latina, which had been made for Stephen I. 2 
In the modern view, its only possible link with St Stephen lies in the original 
cross, a relic of the True Cross now lost, which once topped the arched 
bands of the Latin Crown. 

Whatever their origins, the two constituent parts of the Crown, the Greek 
and the Latin, combine to present the aptest of reminders not of Hungary's 
western connections but of medieval Hungary's location at the heart of 
Christendom. The Greek Crown carries a ring of alternating gem-stones and 
of small plaques of cloisonne enamel. At the front, above the forehead, 
stands a raised plaque of Christ Pantokrator: at the rear, a corresponding 
plaque of the Emperor Michael VII Dukas (r. 1071-8) with green aureole. 
On either side of the Emperor there are portraits of the emperor's son 
Constantine and of King Geza. Geza's plaque is accompanied by a Greek 
inscription: GEOBITZAS PISTOS KRALES TURKIAS (Geza the believer 
king of Turkia). Elsewhere round the rim runs a circle of Byzantine 
archangels and saints. The Latin crown, in contrast, carries eight plaques of 
the apostles, with Christ enthroned at the crossing-point of its bands. A 
leaning gold cross, which replaced the original in 1551 at the time of the first 
Habsburg coronation, precariously surmounts the whole. 3 

What is certain is the aptness of the quality with which the Crown is said 
to be most strongly endowed-its inadmissibility, 'its incapacity to be 
permanently lost'. 4 


MURANO 

Majrano is an island in the Venetian lagoon. It is the site of a Romanesque 
church, Santa Maria e Donato, dating from 999, and the glassworks of the 
former Venetian Republic. 

Glass-making has been practised in Europe since ancient times, but 
Greek and Roman glass was coarse in texture and opaque in colour. It was 




only at Murano, near the turn of the thirteenth century, that the glass-masters 
created a product that was both tough and transparent. For several decades 
the formula remained secret; but then it leaked to Nuremberg, whence it 
spread to all corners of the continent. 

Transparent glass made possible the science of optics, and was crucial in 
the development of precision instruments. The principles of the lens and the 
refraction of light were known by the time, c.1260, that Roger Bacon was 
credited with designing the first pair of spectacles. (There is a portrait of the 
Emperor Henry VII (d. 1313) wearing spectacles in one of the stained glass 
windows of Strasbourg cathedral.) Glass windows gradually came into 
fashion between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, first in churches and 
palaces and later in more humble dwellings. Glass flasks, retorts, and tubes 
facilitated the experiments of alchemy, later of chemistry. Glassclochesand 
greenhouses transformed market-gardening. The microscope (1590), 
telescope (1608), barometer (1644), and thermometer (1593), all glass- 
based, revolutionized our views of the world. The silvered mirror, first 
manufactured at Murano, revolutionized the way we see ourselves. 

The social consequences of glass were far-reaching. The use of 
spectacles extended the reading span of monks and scholars, and accelerated 
the spread of learning. Windows increased the hours and efficiency of indoor 
work, especially in northern Europe. Workplaces could be better lit and 
better heated. Greenhouses vastly improved the cultivation of flowers, fruit, 
and vegetables, bringing a healthier and more abundant diet, previously 
known only in the Mediterranean. Storm-proof lanterns, enclosed coaches, 
and watch-glasses all appeared, whilst precision instruments encouraged a 
wide range of scientific disciplines, from astronomy to medicine. 

The mirror had important psychological consequences. People who 
could see a sharp image of their own faces developed a new consciousness. 
They became more aware of their appearances, and hence of clothes, 
hairstyles, and cosmetics. They were also led to ponder the link between 
external features and the inner life, in short, to study personality and 
individuality. They developed interests in portraiture, biography, and 
fashion. The very unmedieval habits of introspection were strongly reflected 
in Rembrandt's, paintings, for example, and ultimately in the novel. The 
Galerie des Glaces (Hall of Mirrors) at the palace of Versailles was opened 
on 15 November 1684. It was a wonder of the age. Spanning the full facade 



of the central pavilion and overlooking the park, its colossal mirrors 
reflected the light of seventeen huge windows and seventeen colossal 
chandeliers. It was the secular counterpart to the medieval stained glass of 
Chartres. 

The ancients had seen through glass darkly. The moderns saw through it 
clearly, in a shocking, shining cascade of light that reached into their 
innermost lives. 1 


Other historians would go still further. Compared to previous conditions, the 
growth of cities was spectacular; and their activities have been seen as evidence 
for the 'take-off' of a European economy.- This is perhaps an exaggeration. The 
huge annual fairs which were held from 1180 onwards on the plains of 
Champagne, at Lagny, Provins, Troyes, or Bar-sur-Aube, were indeed a major 
development. They were located midway between the urban centres in 
Lombardy, in the Rhineland, in the Low Countries, and in northern Prance; and 
they provided the meeting-point for merchants and financiers with international 
connections. One can say that they were the focus of a Europe-wide, if not an 
all-European, economic system. 

Urban wealth underlay many of the political problems. City corporations 
were acquiring the means to challenge the authority of the local bishop or count, 
just as the guilds and merchant associations could press the city fathers. (The 
first recorded strike was organized by the weavers of Douai in 1245.-) The 
feudal order was weakening from within. In Germany, the sturdy independence 
of cities such as Cologne or Nuremberg helps to explain why neither the Church 
nor the barons could reimpose the authority of the Hohenstaufen. In Italy, the 
colossal resources of Milan, Genoa, Venice, and Florence explain why the wars 
of Guelphs and Ghibellines were so intractable, why neither Pope nor Emperor 
would desist. In Flanders, urban overpopulation supplied an important element 
in the migrations to the East. There were marked contrasts between Eastern and 
Western Europe- which none the less, and as always, betrayed strong 
indications of interdependence. Europe was on the move. 

Schiedam, County of Holland, 5 December 1262. Hendrik, Bishop of Utrecht, 
on the Eve of St Nicholas granted a licence to a church built and endowed 'on 





the new land' at Schiedam by the Countess Aleida van Henegouwen, Regent of 
Holland and Zeeland: 


Henricus Dei Gratia Traiectensis episcopus universis presentes literas inspecturis salutem in Domino 
sempiternam. Cum illustris domina, dilecta nostra consanguinea domina Aleidis, uxor quondam domini 
lohannis de Avennis, Hollandie et Selandie tutrix, in nova terra apud Schiedam in divini honorem nominis 
de novo ecclesiam construi fecerit et dotaverit eandem, nos ipsius in hac parte piis supplicationibus inclinati 
ad huiusmodi structuram ecclesiae licentiam concedimus...- 


PLOVUM 

The heavy, iron, three-piece plough or plovum was a far more sophisticated 
implement than its predecessor, the simple wooden 'scratch-plough' or 
aratrum. Equipped with a vertical sod-cutter or coulter, a horizontal 
ploughshare, a tilted mouldboard, and usually with wheels, it could turn the 
heaviest soils. Yet it demanded the sort of tractive power that was rarely 
available in the ancient world. A thousand years passed between its earliest 
sighting by Pliny in the Po valley and its general adoption in northern 
Europe in the eleventh to twelfth centuries. For all that time, the main 
problem was how to pull it. In the early Middle Ages ox teams were the 
norm. Land was measured in ox-hides and ox-gangs, i.e. in units of 
ploughland that could be served by one ox-team. But the ox was painfully 
slow; and a full team of eight oxen was expensive both to buy and to feed. 
Horses were only bred in the fast but smaller and less powerful breeds. 

Five developments were required before the iron plough could come into 
its own. First was the breeding of heavy farm-horses-an offshoot of the 
Carolingian charger. Second was the horse-collar, not noted before ad 800, 
which enabled the draught animal to haul maximum loads without being 
throttled. Third was the horseshoe, adopted c.900. Fourth was the cultivation 
of oats, the workhorse's staple food. Most important of all was the 
introduction of the three-field system of crop rotation. The change from the 
two-field to the three-field plan greatly improved crop yields whilst 
increasing the peasant family's productivity by at least 50 per cent. It 
permitted the growing of all four cereals, and effectively distributed the 
peasant's toil between spring and autumn sowing. But it demanded a marked 





rise in ploughing capacity. (See Plate 29.) 

By the twelfth century at the latest, all the elements of the northern 
agricultural revolution were in place from France to Poland. Historians may 
have modified some of the simpler equations of the subject, such as 
Meltzen's 'Scratch-plough + cross-ploughing = square fields' or Marc 
Bloch's famous 'Three-piece plough + wheels = strips = open fields = 
communal agriculture'. But the main lines are now generally accepted. 
Square-shaped upland fields, which required cross-ploughing, were often 
abandoned, whilst long open-strip fields made their appearance in the heavy 
but fertile lands of the valley bottoms. Europe's landscape was altered once 
and for all. The fields were adorned with the familiar pattern of ridge-and- 
furrow. Time saved from ploughing could be used to extend the arable. 
Forests were felled, marshes drained, polders reclaimed from the sea. Larger 
villages clustered in the valleys, and the working of the strips was regulated 
by new forms of communal management. The village council and the 
manorial economy both went into action. From it all, Europeans gained a 
growing supply of ever more nutritious food that was to sustain a 
correspondingly greater population until the dawn of the Industrial 
Revolution. 1 


Two years later, the Countess Aleida ordered a dam and sluice to be built across 
the stream of the Schie at the point where it flowed into the tidal waters of the 
Rhine delta. Its purpose was to regulate the channel which linked the nearby 
town of Delft with its tiny river-port of Delfshaven. It was to be built in 
conjunction with another dike and dam across a still smaller rivulet, the Rotte, 
two miles upstream. Three years after that, on 11 August 1270, the young Count 
Floris V granted privileges to the burghers of Rotterdam.- About the same time, 
construction of a dam began on the River Amstel, 35 miles to the north. Step by 
step, the Rhine delta was being tamed. 

Though not the earliest man-made constructions in the area, the dams were 
specifically designed to aid commercial navigation in the perilous wastes which 
stretched in a huge arc over some 25,000 km 2 (10,000 sq. miles) between the 
Scheldt and the Ems (see Map 13, opposite). In retrospect, they may be seen as 
crucial steps in the evolution of Europe's most densely populated country, of the 
world's largest port, and of one of Europe's most distinctive nations. It could not 





have seemed so at the time. 


The country of Holland was one of the more remote and underdeveloped 
districts of the Holy Roman Empire. Its name, meaning Holt-land or 
'Marshland', underlined the fact that it was entirely dominated by the watery 
wastes. It was the lowest of all the low countries, the Nederlanden. Between the 
ring of sand islands on the seaward side and the inland terra firma, at least two- 
thirds of its surface area lay below sea-level. It consisted for the most part of 
mud-flats, salt-marsh, flood-banks, brackish lakes, and treacherous xvadden or 
shallows. Travel was usually by boat, except in the winter when the shallow 
waters froze solid to form roads across the ice. 

The Rhine delta was the most recent and most mobile of Europe's landforms. 
Created in the few thousand years since the last Ice Age, it had been shaped by 
the contending forces of three north-flowing rivers-the Scheldt (Escaut), the 
Maas (Meuse), and the Rijn (Rhine)-and of the westerly winds and tides of the 
sea. As a result, it was visibly subject to change and movement. The seaborne 
sand had formed a massive barrier of dunes up to 70 m high and 4 or 5 km wide. 
Behind this, the river-borne sediment piled up in ever-shifting configurations, 
whilst the freshwater flow gushed and probed against the points of least 
resistance in the unceasing battle to force new outlets to the sea. In Roman times, 
a number of coastal forts had stood on the sand barrier beyond a great inland 
lagoon, the Fleo Lacus. The main waters of the 'Old Rhine' reached the sea 
through a channel which still exists in modern Leiden, whilst the 'Old Maas' 
wound its separate way some twenty miles further south. 

But the intervening millennium had wrought several dramatic alterations. In 
839 a great flood had diverted the principal Rhine flow into the Maas, creating 
the interlinked channels of Lek, Waal, and 'New Maas'. The freshwater lagoon 
to the north, starved of water, partly silted up. Then, in the twelfth and thirteenth 
centuries, a warmer climatic phase caused a gradual rise in the sea-level. The 
dune barrier was breached repeatedly, the estuary of the Scheldt was split into 
several channels, opening Antwerp to sea traffic; and islands proliferated. The 
salt water rushed in to turn the northern lagoon into a broad sea bay, the Zuider 
Zee, which cut Frisia in two. High tides were overrunning the tributaries of the 
mainchannels, threatening the livelihood of the towns on their banks. This was 
the problem that inspired the construction of the dams. 




Map 13. The Low Countries, 1265 


Prior to the mid-thirteenth century, human habitation in the delta region had 
been limited to three types of location. There was a string of ancient towns on 
the edge of the mainland. Arnhem (Arenacum or 'Sandtown'), nearby Nijmegen 
(Noviomagum or 'New Market 5 ), and Utrecht (Trajectum ad Rhenam or 'Rhine 
Ford') were all Roman foundations. Antwerp (Aen de Werpen or 'Anchorage') 
had grown up round the seventh-century church of St Amand on the banks of the 
Scheldt. There were a few isolated settlements on the sand-dunes, such as the 
abbey of Middleburg on Walcheren dating from 1120, or the hunting-lodge 
recently built at s'Gravenhaage or 'Count's Hedge' in 1242. A number of fishing 
villages had found a precarious foothold in the lee of the dunes. Several of these 
had reached the status of a formal chartered city-Dordrecht (1220), Haarlem 
(1245), Delft (1246), and Alkmaar (1254). But none of them contained a fraction 
of the teeming population of the great textile cities of neighbouring Flanders. For 
centuries, the bishop of Utrecht exercised the main religious and secular 









authority. The delta ports had long served as staging posts on the costal trade. 

Land reclamation was an ancient and improving art. Holland's characteristic 
terpen or artificial 'mounds', on which houses could be safely built above flood 
level, dated from time immemorial. They had been mentioned by Pliny. The 
earliest dikes of the zeewering or 'sea-defences' dated from the eighth or ninth 
century. River dikes began to spread after the perfection of the sluice-gate in the 
eleventh century. The construction of polders or enclosed 'stake fields' depended 
on a sophisticated system of drainage which was not mastered until c.1150. The 
dikes had to be built, with back-breaking labour, round lines of stakes driven 
deep into the soft ground, then filled with rubble and stones and planted with 
anchor grass. Once enclosed, the field had to be repeatedly flooded with fresh 
water over ten or fifteen years and repeatedly drained to disperse the salt. Only 
then could the rich alluvial soil begin to repay the efforts. But its fertility was 
proverbial: as well as the meat, wool, and leather of sheep and cattle that grazed 
on the sea-turf pastures, it provided both the life-support system for dense 
colonization and an abundance of produce for export to the neighbouring towns. 

In the thirteenth century the polderization of Holland was in its infancy: it 
could only nibble at the very edge of the marshes. Before the introduction of 
wind-driven water-balers, there was no efficient means of draining large 
enclosures. Immense damage was to be done by the terrible St Elizabeth flood of 
1421, which drowned 72 villages and 10,000 people and negated the progress of 
two centuries. The greater part of the land below sea-level requiring permanent 
drainage could not be touched until the invention c.1550 of windmills with 
rotating turrets, which could pump non-stop, irrespective of wind direction. No 
schedule for reclaiming the whole of Holland existed before the Land 
Reclamation Act of 1918. Another catastrophic flood was needed in 1953 before 
the grand Delta Plan (1957-86) was brought in to regulate all the rivers and fill 
the channels to the sea. Eight hundred years of dogged struggle against the 
elements cannot have failed to leave its mark on the people involved. Some 
historians have been tempted to see it as the determinant factor in the Dutch 
character. 

The building of the dams marked a special stage in this long history. It 
launched a system of inland waterways whose operation could be controlled by 
the keepers of the sluices. Since seagoing ships could not easily pass the narrow 
locks, entrepots sprang up round the dams, where shipping could exchange 
cargoes with those of smaller river barges. Schiedam-Rotterdam and Amsterdam 



both grew from the junction of the sea trade and the river trade. They would not 
grow to pre-eminence, however, without a whole series of extraneous 
developments which resulted in the demise of their principal competitors. 
Foremost among these, and at a much later date, was the wholly arbitrary ruin of 
Antwerp, effected through the forcible closure of the Scheldt 1648-1863. (See p. 
567.) 

Holland's strategic location on the western frontier of the Empire ensured a high 
degree of political involvement. It had once formed the northern segment of the 
middle kingdom of 'Lotharingia'. It spent a dozen years in the early tenth 
century in the sphere of West Francia, before passing definitively into the 
eastern, imperial sphere in 925. For the next 300 years, as part of the 'Duchy of 
Lower Lorraine', it was drawn into the endless rivalries of the feudal princes and 
their manoeuvrings between the Empire and the rising kingdom of France. 

The counts of Holland traced their pedigree to Dirk I (Dietrich, Thierri, or 
Theodoric), the descendant of Vikings who had established a base in the delta in 
the ninth century. Dirk I had been granted lands near Haarlem in 922, in a district 
then called Kennemerland, where he founded the Benedictine monastery of 
Egmont. The family's fortunes were assured after 1018 when Count Dirk III, 
having set up unauthorized tolls on the lower Rhine, repulsed the Duke of 
Lorraine in a famous battle on the dikes. Dirk III first used the name of Holland 
in his title. Thereafter, secure in their castle at Haarlem, the counts engaged in 
ceaseless feudal strife. Holland was one of a dozen counties whose interests 
straddled the imperial frontier. Neither the Emperor nor the king of France could 
exert a permanent influence, except by proxy through the shifting combinations 
of their vassals. For practical purposes the feudal lords of the ill-defined Low 
Countries, the Nederlanden, which stretched from the Rhineland to Picardy, 
fought it out among themselves. By doing so, they were gradually creating a 
region with a separate identity and with a destiny that was neither German nor 
French. 

Within this circle, Holland must be counted one of the lesser lights. The 
mighty bishops of Utrecht and Liege, the dukes of Lorraine and Brabant, and the 
neighbouring county of Flanders were all much more substantial. Holland's 
successful contest with Flanders over the control of the islands of Zeeland had 
mn for centuries until the Peace of Bmssels in 1253. Her subjugation of the 
fierce inhabitants of Frisia or Friesland, who remained pagan until 



Charlemagne's time, had been concluded more by the inundations of the sea than 
by successful conquest. Together with the excess population of the crowded 
Flemish cities, distressed Frieslanders supplied one of the largest contingents of 
emigrants who were colonizing the lands of Germany's eastern marches. 

None the less, the counts of Holland were men of considerable political 
substance. William I (r. 1205-22) fought at Bouvines on the imperial side and 
was taken prisoner by the French. Like his forebear, who had taken Lisbon from 
the Saracens, he was a devoted crusader. He died in Egypt after participating in 
the siege of Damietta. William II (r. 1234-56) aspired to the supreme imperial 
dignity. Succeeding as a minor, he was raised a son of the Church by his 
guardian, the Bishop of Utrecht, and found himself propelled into the higher 
realms of Pope Innocent IV's attempts to depose the Hohenstaufen. (See p. 353.) 
In 1247 he was crowned at Aachen under ecclesiastical sponsorship as King, or 
anti-King, of the Romans. Married to a Guelph duchess, and allied to the 
powerful confederation of Rhineland cities, he briefly won the upper hand in 
Germany's internecine politics. In January 1256 he went home to Holland to 
deal with a local problem in Frisia before proceeding to his coronation as 
Emperor in Rome. A crack in the ice, through which armoured horse and 
armoured rider sank on impact, put an end to a promising career. But for the 
accident, the Hollander would probably have become Holy Roman Emperor. 

Floris V (r. 1256-96), the current Count and the grandson of William II, was 
to be the penultimate incumbent of Holland's first dynasty. He was the ruler who 
finally put an end to the Frisian troubles, and who won the acclaim of his 
lowliest subjects. Faced by an insurrection of peasants, who joined forces with 
the mob of Utrecht, he undertook to curb the arbitrary rule of his bailiffs and to 
introduce a code of written laws. He was remembered in legend as der keerlen 
God, The Peasant's God'. For many years he was to enjoy a close alliance with 
Edward I of England, to whose court he sent his son and heir to be educated and 
married. This was Count Floris, the hero of Holland's 'Rhyming Chronicle', the 
Rijmkronik van Melis Stoke: 

Tgraefscap ende dat jonghe kynt 

Daer wonder of ghesciede sint. 

(So ended the countship of the young man [who] was the wonder of history.)- 

Aleida van Henegouven was the aunt and guardian of the young Floris V. As 


Regent of Holland during the Count's minority, she was one of several powerful 
women who held the reins of state in the Netherlands. Of these, the most 
prominent was her neighbour, the extraordinary Countess Margaret of Flanders. 
Known as Zwarte Griet or 'Black Meg', Countess Margaret (d. 1280) was 
caught up in all the feudal fortunes and misfortunes that one could imagine. She 
was the younger daughter of Count Baldwin IX, the leader of the Fourth 
Crusade, who took over the Latin Empire of the East. Like her sister Joanna she 
had been born in Constantinople, whence she had been brought home after her 
father's death and, together with Joanna, made a pawn of the politics of Innocent 
III. As a child, she watched her sister married off to Fernando of Portugal, 
nephew of the King of France, whilst she herself was given as a child bride to 
Bouchard d'Avesnes, Lord of Hainault. After the battle of Bouvines, which sent 
Fernando to the dungeons of the Louvre, she saw her sister married for a second 
time to Thomas of Savoy, whilst she herself, on the Pope's insistence, was 
divorced and remarried to a French knight, Guy de Dampierre. By the time in 
1244 that she succeeded Joanna as Countess both of Hainault and of Flanders, 
she was mother of five sons by two marriages, and already one of the prime 
survivors of her day. She could not prevent her two eldest sons fighting over her 
inheritance and was obliged to accept a famous mediation of St Louis, who 
awarded Hainault to Jean d'Avesnes and Flanders to Guillaume de Dampierre. 
She would outlive them all. 

Flanders, which was torn by the rivalry of Bruges and Ghent, was none the 
less the richest prize in Netherlands politics. Its fate could not be a matter of 
indifference to Holland. In the past the counts of Flanders had balanced between 
the Empire and France and had accepted fiefs from both sides, creating groups of 
territories known as Kroon-Vlaanderen and Rijks-Vlaanderen. Since Bouvines, 
however, French influence had been rising steeply, and would lead to a full-scale 
French occupation. In 1265 the struggle between Pope and Emperor was fast 
approaching its nadir. The Papacy had blocked the cause of the Hohenstaufen 
after Frederick II's death; and the interregnum in the Empire, which Count 
William's accident left unresolved, was sinking into ever deeper complications. 
1257 had brought a double election: one meeting of the imperial Electors 
produced a decision in favour of Richard, Earl of Cornwall, the younger brother 
of Henry III of England, a second meeting decided for Alfonso, King of Castile. 
In contrast to Alfonso, who stayed at home in Toledo, Earl Richard did proceed 
to his coronation as King of the Romans. But neither of the rival candidates 
could exercise any authority over Germany as a whole. 



Richard of Cornwall (1209-72) was one of the wealthiest and best-connected 
men of his age.- His possession of the Cornish stannaries was worth a second 
earldom, whilst his management of the Mint and of England's reformed coinage 
brought him a fabulous cash income. Through his financial adviser, Abraham of 
Berkhamsted, he was able to make loans to kings and cardinals; and he had no 
difficulty in finding the 28,000 marks which greased the machinery of his 
German election. Lord of Corfe, and of Wallingford and Berkhamsted, he had 
dabbled with the baronial opposition in England, and was known as one of the 
very few barons who actually spoke English. As titular Count of Poitou, he held 
strong interests in Gascony, where he had served as royal governor. He had led a 
Crusade to Acre, but had used the expedition as an occasion for making the 
personal acquaintance of his two brothers-in-law, first of St Louis in Paris and 
then of Frederick II in Sicily. He had good relations with the Low Countries, 
whence Floris V had hastened to London to pay him homage in person. He was 
due to take as his third wife, after Isabella Marshal and Sanchia of Provence, 
Beatrice Countess of Falkenburg in Brabant. 

For most of 1265, however, Earl Richard's fortunes were at a low ebb. Three 
visits to Germany had given him no benefit. What is more, having been caught 
up in his brother's baronial war and captured by de Montfort's men, he was now 
a prisoner in Kenilworth Castle. His inglorious adventures after the Battle of 
Lewes, where he hid in a windmill, gave birth to one of England's earliest 
political satires: 

The King of Alemaigne wende do fill wel 
He saisede the mulne for a castel, 

With hare sharpe swerds he grounde the stel 

He wende that the sayles were mangonel to helpe Wyndesor. 

Richard, thah thou be ever trichard 

trichen shalt thou never more.- 

At that juncture, the royal party was well and truly hated in England. Simon 
de Montfort, the protector genus Angliae, was seen as a popular champion 
against oppression: 

II est apele de Montfort, 

II est el mond et si est fort 
Si ad grant chevalerie. 

Ce voir, et je m'acort, 


II eime droit, et hete Ie tort. 
Si avera la mestene.- 


(He is called de Montfort / He is our protector (mund) and is so strong (fort) I And has such great chivalry. / 
Look here, I quite agree, / He loves right and hates wrong. / Thus he will have the mastery.) 


When Simon was killed at Evesham on 4 August 1265, his companions in the 
emplacement on Green Hill died with him to a man; he was mourned as a saint 
and a martyr. 

That year also saw a papal election. Clement IV was a Frenchman who, as 
Guy Foulques, had once had a wife and children and had served as legal 
consultant to St Fouis. Rome and parts of northern Italy were still so sympathetic 
to the Hohenstaufen that Clement, who had been away on legation to England, 
was obliged to travel home disguised as a monk and to take up residence in 
Perugia. From there he arranged for Charles of Anjou to be invested with the 
kingdom of Sicily and Naples, and for finance to be found for the brutal 
campaigns that were to put an end first to the Emperor's bastard son, Manfred, 
and then to Manfred's nephew, the young Conradin. From Perugia, he sent a bull 
to the Abbey of Egmont in Holland confirming its ancient rights and 
immunities.- 

Fike the Civil War in England, the imperial interregnum in Germany reduced 
the country to chaos: 

Every floodgate of anarchy was opened; prelates and barons extended their domains by war; robber-knights 
infested the roads and the rivers; the misery of the weak, the tyranny and violence of the strong were such 
as had not been seen for centuries ... The Roman Empire ought now to have been suffered to expire.- 

Fess traditional historians do not see the Empire's distress quite so drastically. 
The absence of an Emperor gave the signal for the rise of several regional and 
city states, which were destined to play a prominent role in European history. 
The Netherlands, among others, prospered in the shadow of the Empire's 
weakness. 

Holland, however, was the main focus neither of politics of the Netherlands 
nor of the Dutch language. Various forms of proto-Middle Dutch were spoken 
right through the Low Countries as far west as Kortrijk (Courtrai) and Rijsel 
(Lille). French was dominant in Hainault, Liege, and Namur and in the speech of 
the nobility in general. Low German overlapped on the eastern borders in 
Guelders. But the greatest pool of Dutch-speakers was undoubtedly contained in 


the cities of Flanders. Dialectical nuances between Vlaams and Hollandisch 
were not marked. Holland itself was still engaged in assimilating Frisian, 
Frankish, and Saxon elements. Frisian in particular, which was the closest of the 
Germanic idioms to English, was still strong in north Holland and the islands. 
The establishment of Holland as the home of standard Dutch, or Nederlands, 
was the work of a much later age. 

Dutch literature, too, was largely written in Flanders. Thirteenth-century 
Holland did produce a number of valuable texts, including the Egmont Chronicle 
and an animal fantasy Van den Vos Reinarde (c.1270), by a certain Willem. But 
the leading names, such as Jacob van Maerlent (c.1235-71), author of 
Alexander's Feasts (1258) and born at Bruges, were Flemings. 

Foreign trade flowed as yet quite feebly. Dordrecht, where a castle had been 
built to owerawe ships plying between the Rhineland and the North Sea, was the 
only port of substance. It had contacts with England, and hopes of drawing the 
lucrative English staple from the more prosperous Flemish ports along the coast. 
There were no regular links with the Baltic, or with Russia.- Social conditions 
in Holland did not conform to the standard structures of the 'age of feudalism'. 
Feudal institutions, in fact, were weak. Serfdom was rare beyond the estates of 
the Church, and settlements of free peasants and independent fisherfolk were 
common. The nobles, though well integrated into the practices and mores of 
knighthood and landownership, were not subordinated in any systematic way to 
feudal superiors. The cities, though small, could look to the example of the 
nearby Rhineland, and were set to play a preponderant role. Religious life in 
Holland was also somewhat untypical. The bishop of Utrecht was losing much 
of his former power, and did not exercise the same degree of secular and legal 
authority that flourished in the neighbouring diocese of Liege. Despite a number 
of new foundations, neither the friars nor the new monastic orders had impressed 
their presence very strongly. Frisia was a notorious refuge of pagan survivals; 
rebellious mystic sects were an established fact. 

Any description of Holland's early history belies the popular misconception that 
Europe's later nations must already have existed in embryo in the medieval 
period. The thirteenth century marks the mid-point of the span which separates 
our contemporary age from the so-called 'Birth of Europe' amidst the ruins of 
the Classical World. One might have expected that the national communities, 
which came to dominate the end of the story, would at least be discernible, albeit 


in a half-formed stage of development. Yet this was not so. In the case of the 
Low Countries, familiar terms such as 'Holland', 'Dutch', and 'Netherlands' all 
possessed different connotations from those which they later acquired. The 
modern myth about the permanent union of a 'nation' and its 'soil' was plainly 
irrelevant In the thirteenth century Holland was not the core of a developing 
Dutch nation. Indeed, much of the soil which 300 and 400 years later would 
form the central territorial base of Dutch national consciousness had not yet been 
deposited. 

Most of Europe in 1265 displayed the same lack of recognizable national 
communities. In the middle of the Christian Reconquista, the Iberian states of 
Portugal, Castile, and Aragon had little awareness of a common Spain. In the 
year of Dante's birth, the defeat of the Hohenstaufen was putting an end to the 
dream of a united Italy. In the midst of the Mongol invasions and the 'age of 
fragmentation', a united Poland was no more than a memory. There was no 
longer any Rus', let alone a sense of Russia. A kingdom of England did exist, on 
the ruins of the Plantagenet empire; but it still had stronger connections with the 
Continent, in Gascony and Aquitaine, than with Wales or Ireland. Its French- 
speaking Anglo-Norman aristocracy did not yet share a common culture with the 
English people, and the baronial opposition was led by Continental adventurers 
like de Montfort. There was no concept of Britishness whatsoever. The kingdom 
of Scotland was still disputing its territory with the Norwegians, who had just 
invaded the northern isles. Under St Louis, the kingdom of France now stretched 
from the Channel to the Mediterranean. But it was an amalgam of the most 
diverse elements that would have to disintegrate before they could be 
reconstituted for a second time as a more cohesive whole. As the interregnum 
showed, the German Empire had collapsed in all but name. It was hopelessly 
rent by the competing interests of its German and its Italian territories on either 
side of the Alps. There was no such country as Switzerland; and the Habsburgs 
were yet to move to Austria. The Prussia of the Teutonic Knights was in the 
earliest decades of its career; but it bore no resemblance to the later Prussia of 
the Hohenzollerns (who in 1265 were still ensconced in their native castle in 
Swabia). In Scandinavia, Norway had broken away from Danish control; but the 
break was not due to last. The Swedes, like the Lithuanians, were embroiled in 
multinational conquests in the East. Bohemia under Ottokar II (r. 1253-78) was 
at the pinnacle of its glory, having just annexed Austria and Styria. Hungary was 
in a state of collapse, following the two Mongol raids, and was facing the end of 
the native arpad dynasty. The Byzantine Empire, Europe's oldest polity, had 



recovered Constantinople four years before, and had driven out the Latin 
usurpers to their toeholds in Greece. None of these entities was destined to 
survive into modern times. 

It would be problematical, therefore, to talk of national states at any point in 
the thirteenth century. But if national identities were judged to be developing 
effectively in any place at the time, it could only have been in some of the small 
countries who had successfully segregated themselves from their neighbours. 
Portugal was a candidate for this, as was Denmark, and, in the Balkans, Serbia 
and Bulgaria. Both Serbia and Bulgaria had re-established their independence 
from Byzantium in the 1180s. More importantly, they both created their own 
national Orthodox Churches with their own patriarchs-Bulgaria in 1235, Serbia 
in 1346. This step gave them a powerful instrument for forging a separate 
identity, for educating a national elite, for political publicity, and for the 
sanctification of national institutions. It was a step which none of the countries 
of Latin Christendom could take until the Reformation, and which Muscovite 
Russia did not take until 1589. It strengthened the bonds of these two Slav 
peoples whose cohesion would be tested through 500 years of Ottoman rule. 

For Europe was living out its last few decades before the Ottomans, and the 
second great Muslim advance. The silk road to the East was still open. Christian 
travellers were reporting on their journeys to Tartary. In the year that a 'Venice 
of the North' was founded on the Amstel, Marco Polo set out from the Rialto for 
China. 

Dutch historians, like everyone else, have had to contend with the habit of 
reading history backwards. When national histories were first formulated in the 
nineteenth century, the Low Countries had just been definitively divided into the 
kingdoms of Belgium and Holland; and it was accepted form to maintain that 
separate Flemish and Dutch communities had been present from the earliest 
times. Great pains were taken to show that the medieval churches of Sluis, for 
example, on one side of the Scheldt, were pearls of the Hollandish style, while 
the churches of Damme on the other bank were treasures of the Flemish heritage. 
It took a great leap of the imagination for historians to demonstrate that separate 
Dutch and Belgian traditions did not pre-date the Dutch Revolt of 1566-1648 
(see PP- 534-9) which put an arbitrary stop on the previous growth of a shared 
Netherlands consciousness. It was more difficult to suggest in the early chapters 
of the story that little sense of a common identity existed, and still more that 



Holland might not have lain at the heart of Dutchness. There were many more 
twists in the tale, under Burgundian and Habsburg rule, and many fundamental 
shifts in economic and demographic patterns, before the 'Land of the Dams' 
could assume its modern form and function. After all, it was not until 1593 that 
Carolus Clusius (1526-1609), Professor of Medicine at Leiden, received the 
very first tulip bulbs from Turkey and planted them in the fertile flowerfields 
between Leiden and Haarlem. 

In all these matters of nationality, the key element is consciousness. As one 
Dutch historian explained, nationality can be observed neither in the blood, nor 
in the soil, nor even on the tongue: 

Nationality exists in the minds of men,... its only conceivable habitat... Outside men's minds there can be 
no nationality, because nationality is a manner of looking at oneself not an entity an sich. Common sense is 
able to detect it, and the only human discipline that can describe and analyse it is psychology ... This 
awareness, this sense of nationality, this national sentiment, is more than a characteristic of the nation. It is 
nationhood itself.- 

In the thirteenth century, in the midst of the feudal strife, it is very doubtful 
whether the local patriotism of Holland could have started to merge into any 
sense of general solidarity with the Low Countries as a whole. Three hundred 
years before the stirring and formative experiences of the Dutch Revolt, it is 
certain that the half-formed northern provinces, such as Holland, could not have 
possessed much common consciousness vis-a-vis the southern provinces. One 
can only conclude that the Dutch nation did not then exist. This is an object 
lesson for the whole of medieval Europe. 

After which one may be tempted to enquire as to where, if not in nations, the 
thirteenth-century consciousness actually resided. The only answer must be 
'there was what there was'. Medieval Europeans were conscious of belonging to 
their native village or town, and to a group possessing a local language whose 
members could communicate without recourse to Latin or Greek. They were 
aware of belonging to a body of men and women who acknowledged the same 
feudal lord; to a social estate, which shared the same privileges; above all, to the 
great corporation of Christendom. Beyond that, as the greatest son of the 1260s 
would soon describe, one could only wait for Death and the Day of Judgement. 
Then at last one could learn to which of the really important social groups one 
belonged-to the passengers on the ferry of the Damned, to the company of 
penitents sailing for Purgatory, or perhaps to the choirs of Paradise.

widely known as bougars a corruption of 'Bulgars'. Also, since the perfecti 
practised severe sexual celibacy, they were widely accused of sodomy. Hence the 
evolution in the meaning of'buggery'. 



VI 


PESTIS 

Christendom in Crisis, c. 1250-1493 




There is a sense of fatalism about life in the later Middle Ages. People knew 
that Christendom was sick; they knew that the ideals of the Gospel of Love were 
far removed from prevailing reality; but they had little idea of how to cure it. 
The senior Christian state, the Byzantine Empire, was reduced to a pathetic 
rump. The Holy Roman Empire could not control its own mighty subjects, let 
alone exercise leadership over others. The Papacy was falling into the quagmire 
of political dependence. Feudal particularism reached the point where every city, 
every princeling, had to fight incessantly for survival. The world was ruled by 
brigandage, superstition, and the plague. When the Black Death struck, the wrath 
of God was clearly striking at Christendom's sins. 'According to a popular 
belief, no-one since the beginning of the great Western Schism had entered 
Paradise.'- 

At the same time, 'the violent tenor' of medieval life, its 'vehement pathos', 
had so intensified the pains and pleasures of living that modern sensibility is said 
to be barely capable of grasping them. 'The violent contrasts and impressive 
forms lent a tone of excitement and passion to everyday life, and tended to 
produce that perpetual oscillation between despair and distracted joy, between 
cruelty and pious tenderness, which characterises the Middle Ages.' 2 

Johan Huizinga, whose studies have had a powerful impact on perceptions of 
the period, was talking not only of insecurity in face of constant calamities but 




also of the 'proud or cruel publicity' which surrounded almost all persons and 
events-the lepers with rattles, the beggars in churches, the public executions, 
the hellfire sermons, the processions, the dwarves and magicians, the pageantry, 
the stark colours of heraldry, the steeple bells and the street-criers, the stench and 
the perfume: 

When the massacre of the Armagnacs was in full swing... [in 1418] the Parisians founded a brotherhood of 
Saint Andrew in the church of Saint Eustache: every one, priest or layman, wore a wreath of red roses, so 
that the church was perfumed ... as if washed with rose-water.- 



Europe, c.1300 

This 'extreme excitability of the medieval soul' may owe something to the 
Gothic enthusiasms of the later Romantics. But it is an essential element to be 
considered in the impossible task of recapturing the medieval past. 











Yet the very brilliance of Huizinga's thesis invites caution. Like most 
Western historians, he directed his researches to one corner of Western Europe, 
in his case to France and the Netherlands; and there must be some reluctance to 
apply the generalizations to Christendom as a whole. More importantly, in 
portraying the spirit of the declining Middle Ages so vividly, there must be some 
danger of underplaying the seeds of change and regeneration which were also 
present. Renaissance scholars have no difficulty in tracing the origins of their 
subject to the early fourteenth century (see Chapter VII). It stands to reason that 
there was a very long period when the old coexisted with the new. Historians 
stress the one or the other according to the burden of their tale. Huizinga 
suggested that humanist forms did make a late appearance, but without the 
'inspiration' of the Renaissance. And he ended with that favourite metaphor of 
all historians struggling with the rhythms of change: 'the tide is turning'. - 

In the circumstances, it may be wise to resist the metaphor of the waning 
medieval twilight. It might be more accurate to think of the period in terms of a 
prolonged crisis for which contemporaries had no solution. There was no 
awareness of a dawn to come. In more senses than one, late medieval Europeans 
were children of the plague. 




The Byzantine Empire, as reconstituted after the expulsion of the Latin 
Emperors, was a mere shadow of a shadow. On the European shore it held little 
more than the city of Constantinople and the adjacent province of Roumelia. In 
Asia Minor it held a few towns on the Black Sea, and most of the Aegean 
coastline. Elsewhere, its former provinces were in the hands of the independent 
kingdoms of Bulgaria and Serbia; of assorted Frankish princes, displaced 
crusaders, and Venetian governors; and in Anatolia, of the Turkish sultans of 
Iconium, the so-called empire of Trebizond, and the kingdom of Lesser Armenia. 
From 1261 to its eventual destruction in 1453, it was ruled by the dynasty of the 
Palaeologi, descendants of Michael VIII Palaeologus (1258-82), who had 
engineered the recapture of Constantinople during the absence of the Venetian 
fleet. Of this Empire, in its dotage, it has been written: 

The Greeks gloried in the name of Romans: they clung to the forms of imperial government without its 
military power; they retained the Roman code without the systematic administration of justice, and prided 
themselves on the orthodoxy of a Church in which the clergy ... lived in a state of vassalage to the imperial 




Court. Such a society could only wither, though it might wither slowly. - 


The desperate Palaeologi sought aid from all and sundry. To hold off Venice, 
they turned to the Genoans who at various times possessed Amastris, Pera, and 
Smyrna and the islands of Lesbos, Chios, and Samos. They allied with Aragon; 
and on several occasions they tempted the Papacy with the prospect of ending 
the Schism. In the Epoch of Civil Wars, 1321-54, they briefly restored their rule 
as far as Epirus. Until 1382 an anti-emperor maintained his court at Mistra in the 
Morea. By that time John V (1341-91) had become both a catholic and a vassal 
of the Turks. In 1399 his successor, Manuel II (1391-1425), set off on a vain 
journey to raise support in Rome, Paris, and London, [mousike] 

The most sensational development of the era was the appearance of a new 
Turkish warrior tribe that was destined to supplant the Byzantines. The Osmanlis 
or Ottomans moved into the void left by the Mongols' defeat of the Seljuks. 
They took their name from Osman I (r. 1281-1326), son of their founder, 
Ertugrul, who had established an outpost in the Anatolian interior. From that 
base they raided far and wide, chipping away at the Byzantine frontier, launching 
fleets of pirates into the Aegean, and crossing over into the Balkans. They first 
entered Europe in 1308, when a band of Turkish mercenaries was imported by 
the Byzantines' own mercenary force, the Catalan Grand Company, which had 
rebelled against its imperial employers. In that year they took Ephesus; in 1326, 
Bursa-which became their first capital; in 1329, Nicaea; in 1337, Nicomedia. 
Osman's son, Orkhan (r. 1326-62), established a permanent bridgehead on the 
Dardanelles, and styled himself Sultan. His grandson, Murad I (r. 1362-89), 
having set up the second Ottoman capital in Adrianopolis (Edirne), dared to use 
the old Seljuk title 'Sultan-i-Rum' (Sultan of Rome). Sultan Bayezit (r. 1389- 
1403), though defeated by Tamerlane, conducted the main conquest of Asia 
Minor, overwhelming the Greek settlements with Muslim colonists, whilst 
attacking both the Peloponnese and Wallachia. On his death, Ottoman territory 
was forty times greater than a century earlier, and Constantinople was 
surrounded (see Appendix III, p. 1259). 

During that century of conquest, the frontier between Christendom and Islam 
was remade. The Byzantines' former subjects, in Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia, and 
Bosnia, enjoyed a brief interval of liberty and confusion, before they too were 
subjugated by the invincible Turk. The Ottomans led a supreme nation of ghazis, 
'warriors of Islam'-and they knew it. In the old mosque at Bursa, an inscription 
to Orkhan runs: 'To the Sultan, son of the Sultan of the Ghazis, Ghazi son of 


Ghazi, Margrave of the horizons, hero of the world. '- 

Medieval Greece, in the interval between the Latin and the Ottoman 
conquests, was split into local principalities. The despotate of Epirus, the duchy 
of Athens, the southern principality of Achaea, and the island duchy of Naxos all 
passed a couple of centuries in the sun. Their commercial interests were 
controlled by the Italian cities; their rulers were Latins; the populace Orthodox. 

[ROMANY] 

Bulgaria, too, moved away from the Byzantine orbit. The second Bulgarian 
empire, which had emerged in the late twelfth century, was a dynamic, 
multinational realm. From his capital at Trnovo, Ivan Asen (r. 1186-1218), Tsar 
of the Bulgars and Greeks', spread his sway to Belgrade and Skopje. His 
successor, Ivan Asen II (r. 1218-41), took in Albania, Epirus, Macedonia, and 
Thrace. Two further dynasties were of Cuman origin. But on 28 June 1330 Tsar 
Michael Shishman was slain by the Serbians, who thereby established their 
hegemony. In the following decade the Ottomans began to ravish the valley of 
the Maritsa. By 1366 the last Bulgarian Tsar, Ivan Shishman III, was obliged to 
send his sister to the Sultan's harem and to declare himself an Ottoman vassal. 
Trnovo was razed. Bulgaria was starting its 500-year career as an Ottoman 
province. 


ROMANY 

In 1378 the Venetian governor of Nauplion in the Peloponnese confirmed 
privileges already granted to the local community of atsingani. It was the 
first documented record of Romany gypsies in Europe. In 1416 the city of 
Brasov (Kronstadt) in Transylvania made gifts of silver, grain, and poultry to 
one 'Emaus of Egypt and his 120 companions'. In 1418 the same group 
reached Hamburg. In August 1427 a band of some 100 travellers, presenting 
themselves as victims of persecution in Lower Egypt, were refused entry to 
Paris and lodged instead at St Denis. The anonymous chronicler of the 
Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris described them as swarthy, poorly dressed, 
the women with knotted shawls, the children with earrings. They were 
moved on when the Church authorities protested against their palmistry and 
fortune-telling. 1 





There is no doubt that the Romanies migrated to Europe from India, 
although their earlier movements can only be reconstructed from linguistic 
evidence. Romany is an Indo-European language akin to Hindi, and is 
spoken all along the trail through the Middle East to Europe. The fact that 
the European dialects of Romany contain a strong admixture of Slavonic and 
Greek words indicates a lengthy sojourn in the Balkans. 

The long list of names given to Romanies reinforces popular confusion 
about their origins. The Greek atsingani, which gave rise to gitans (French), 
zingari (Italian), gitanos (Spanish), zigeuner (German), and tsigan (Russian), 
derives from the name of a medieval Manichean sect from Asia Minor, and 
is an obvious misattribution. 'Bohemians' and 'Egyptians'-hence gyfti 
(Greek), gypsy (English), and faraoni (Hungarian)-are also common. 
'Romany' probably derives from their medieval attachment to the Byzantine 
Empire, rather than to Romania. They call themselves Rom (singular) or 
Roma (plural). 

Attempts to regulate the presence of nomadic gypsies by law created a 
wide variety of practices. An English statute of 1596 carefully distinguished 
between gypsies and common vagabonds, [picaro] A band of gypsies had 
been apprehended in Yorkshire, and some of them executed for necromancy. 
But the statute permitted law-abiding gypsies to travel, to pursue their 
tinker's trade, and to receive victuals in payment. Similar protection was 
extended in France in 1683. In Austria the statutes of 1761 sought to settle 
the gypsies in fixed abodes-but to no lasting effect. In Russia, Catherine II 
sought to protect gypsies by giving them the status of 'Crown slaves' which 
they had previously been assigned in Moldavia and Wallachia. But, like the 
Jews, they were forbidden to enter St Petersburg. In the Netherlands and 
several German states, a policy of total exclusion was pursued. 

Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, European Romanies 
have struggled to sustain their nomadic lifestyle, their specialized trades, 
their language, and their music [flamenco]. Their culture emphasizes the 
occult, their social organization the importance of extended families and 
tribes presided over by 'kings' and judges. Their communal activities are 
centred on annual gatherings which take place at regular venues. Saintes- 
Maries-de-la-Mer in Camargue, for example, is the scene of a Romany 
festival and pilgrimage which heads every May to the tomb of their 
patroness, Sara. According to legend, Sara was a companion of Mary 



Magdalen who saved a party of Christ's relatives and disciples from 
persecution, and brought them as refugees to Provence. 

During the Romantic era, Romanies attracted great artistic and literary 
attention. Hugo, Merimee, and Borrow all wrote books on gypsy themes. 
Henri Murger's Scenes de la vie de boheme (1849) enjoyed huge popular 
success. Liszt wrote a learned treatise on Romany music, starting a vogue 
which influenced both the classical repertoire and cafe entertainment. Bizet's 
Carmen (1875), based on a story by Merimee, and Puccini's La Boheme 
(1895), based on Murger's Scenes, are among the most enduring of operas. 

Romanies have always been subject to harassment and to periodic 
violence. 2 But the Nazis' wholesale genocide of gypsies, which mirrored 
their extermination of Jews, had no precedent. Communist regimes were 
generally indifferent. The post-war democracies have attempted to combine 
regulation with humanitarian tolerance. But the stereotype of the rootless, 
alien gypsy constantly resurfaces, most recently in the ugly campaign in 
1993 against asylum-seekers in Germany. It is perhaps inevitable that the 
conventionally settled population of Europe will always feel a mixture of 
phobia and fascination for a lifestyle which is so fundamentally different 
from their own: 

Come, let me read the oft-told tale again: 

The story of that Oxford scholar poor, 

Of pregnant parts and quick inventive brain, 

Who, tired of knocking at Preferment's door, 

One summer morn forsook 
His friends, and went to learn the Gipsy-lore, 

And roam'd the world with that wild brotherhood .. . 3 

Serbia suffered a similar fate. Pressed by the neighbouring kingdom of 
Hungary, where their south Slav relations had joined the Catholic fold, the Serbs 
balanced between their Roman and their Orthodox connections. The country was 
first united under Stefan I Nemanya (1114-1200), who had obliged Byzantium 
to concede his independence. Nemanya's youngest son, St Sava (1175-1235), a 
monk of Athos, had emancipated the Serbian Church from the Greek archbishop 




at Okhrid. He persuaded his brother, Stefan II, to accept a royal crown from the 
Pope. Medieval Serbia reached its apogee under the ferocious Stefan IV Dushan 
(1308-55). In 1346, when Dushan was crowned Tsar, Serbia controlled several 
former Bulgarian and Byzantine provinces in the south; a Serbian Patriarch ruled 
from Pec (Ipek); and an imperial Zakonnik or Codex regulated the 
administration. Dushan exercised suzerainty over the young Vlach principalities, 
and even made plans to conquer Constantinople. But Serbia was no match for 
the advancing Ottomans. On 15 June 1389, at Kosovo, on the 'Field of the 
Blackbirds', the Serbian host was humbled. The last Serbian king was slain and 
the Ottoman sultan treacherously murdered. Serbia joined Bulgaria as an 
Ottoman province, [zadruga] 

North of the Danube the Latin-speaking Vlachs, strengthened by migrants 
from the mountains of Transylvania, succeeded in creating independent 
principalities of their own. Henceforth Wallachia and Moldavia became the 
frontier posts of Christian rule in the Balkans. The plight of the Balkan 
Christians reawakened the crusading traditions of the West. In 1344 a naval 
league headed by Venice and the Hospitallers retook Smyrna from the Ottomans 
for a season. In 1365 Amadeus VI of Savoy briefly recaptured Gallipoli, and 
released the emperor imprisoned by the Bulgars. In 1396 a crusading army led 
by Sigismund of Hungary met disaster at Nikopolis on the Danube. In 1402 a 
garrison of crusaders under the French knight Boucicault manned the walls of 
Constantinople, awaiting the Sultan's imminent assault. Beyond the Black Sea, 
the Orthodox Christians of the former Rus' gradually eased the grip of the Tartar 
yoke. In this they were assisted by the two rising power-centres of the north-east 
-the Grand Duchy of Moscow and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, [nikopolis] 

The princes of Moscow grew from obscurity to prominence in the two 
centuries following the Mongol invasion. First, by a combination of valour and 
treachery, they established their supremacy over numerous Rurikid princelings in 
the surrounding region of Vladimir-Suzdal. The hereditary title of Grand Prince 
of Vladimir was theirs from 1364. Secondly, by currying favour with the Khan 
of the Golden Horde, they obtained the yarlyk to act as the Mongols' chief 
tribute-gatherers, accepting responsibility for the payments, and arrears, of all 
other princes. Ivan I (r. 1301-40), known as Kalita or 'the Money-Bag', spent 
more of his reign on the road to Sarai than he did in Moscow. Karl Marx wrote 
that he blended 'the characters of the Tartars' hangman, sycophant, and slave-in- 
chief'.-Thirdly, by lavishly patronizing the Orthodox Church they added an aura 
of religiosity to their political supremacy. In 1300 the Metropolitan Archbishop 


of Kiev moved to Vladimir, and from 1308 resided in Moscow. Monasteries 
were planted far and wide in the forest wilderness, forming new centres for 
commercial and territorial expansion. Despite the Mongol blockade, and a long 
river and sea journey of two months, close contact was maintained with the 
Patriarch of Constantinople. Muscovy was a patrimonial state par excellence, 
where the prince's subjects and their possessions could be treated with total 
disregard. The hold over the resources of the apanage princedoms inexorably 
strengthened Muscovite hegemony. In 1327 Ivan Kalita helped the Mongols to 
suppress a rebellion by his chief rival, the city of Tver' on the Volga. Yet in 
1380-2 Prince Dmitri Donskoy (r. 1350-89) challenged the military might of the 
Mongols for the first time. At Kulikovo, on 8 September 1380, he won a famous 
victory over the invincible horde, only to see Moscow burned in revenge two 
years later. In 1408 Dmitri's son, Vasili I (r. 1389-1425), was tempted to 
withhold the tribute but, with Moscow besieged, relented. The Muscovites were 
waxing powerful, but were still vassals. 


ZADRUGA 

Article 70 of the law code of Stefan Dushan, published c. 1349-54, makes 
a clear reference to the existence of extended families and of joint patrilinear 
households. 'A father and son, or brothers, who live in the same house and 
share the same hearth ', it states, 'but who have separate food and property, 
should work like the other peasants. ' The Serbian Tsar was evidently trying 
to ensure that every peasant household could be taxed on the same basis. 

The Article has been invoked, however, to justify the assumption that the 
zadruga or 'joint patrilinear household' has been the standard form of social 
organization among the Balkan Slavs since time immemorial. It is now 
commonplace for overenthusiastic scholars to discuss the role of the zadruga 
in Slavonic kinship patterns at all points between prehistory and 
contemporary Europe. Yet expert comment has recently exploded some of 
the grosser generalizations. It turns out that the term zadruga is an academic 
neologism first recorded in a Serbian dictionary in 1818. It has never been 
current in the speech of the people who are supposed to practise it. 
Moreover, it is not actually mentioned in the text of Stefan Dushan's law 




code. Although one may conclude from Article 70 that some form of joint 
household did exist in medieval Serbia, there is no reason to assume that the 
zadruga was the standard or prevalent form in all parts of the realm. 

In modern times, the distribution of the zadruga across the Balkans is 
extremely patchy. It is common in the mountainous stock-breeding zone that 
mns from Bosnia and Hercegovina to Montenegro, Macedonia, and central 
Albania. It is frequently encountered in the Rhodopes and the Balkan Range. 
But it is not known on the Adriatic littoral or in most of Bulgaria. It is 
present in sectors of the old Military Frontier or Krajina settled by Serb 
immigrants to Croatia in the sixteenth century, and among the non-Slavic 
Vlachs. It is largely absent from Greece and Romania. 

Most seriously, a cursory survey of recent scholarship on the subject, 
especially in the West, shows that the zadruga is employed for any number 
of contradictory purposes. Above all it is used, with very little foundation of 
fact or detailed research, to bolster spurious assertions either about the 
collectivist inclinations of all Slav peoples, or about the uniform structure of 
a (non-existent) pan-Slav society, or about the backwardness of the Balkans, 
the Volksmuseum of Europe. In short, it is in real danger of becoming a sort 
of racial myth, a worthy partner to that other figment of the Western 
imagination, 'the Slav soul'. 1 


NIKOPOLIS 

On the evening of 25 September 1396 a great French champion, the Sire de 
Coucy, was dragged before the victorious Sultan Bajazet on the field of 
Nikopolis. Together with some other rich crusaders, including Jean de 
Nevers, the future Duke of Burgundy, who were being held for ransom, he 
watched as the scimitars of the Sultan's guards decapitated several thousand 
lesser Christian captives. (The crusaders had recently treated their Muslim 
captives likewise.) He was marched in chains over the 350 miles to 
Gallipoli, then taken to Bursa in Asia, where he wrote his last will and died, 
heirless. 




Nikopolis is forever associated with this last great catastrophe of the 
crusading movement. The principal fortress of Bulgaria, it commanded the 
lower Danube; and its capture by the Ottomans had provoked the expedition 
raised by the King of Hungary. An army of Latin knights had assembled at 
Buda to avenge the Sultan's boast that he would Teed his horse oats on the 
altar of St Peter's'. They brought wine and silks, but no catapults. So the 
siege of Nikopolis failed; and they had to face the Ottomans in the open. A 
premature assault by the French, as at Crecy, was exploited by the cavalry of 
the Sultan's Serbian allies: and the main body of crusaders was encircled. 
Sigismund of Hungary escaped, and a Polish knight famously swam the 
Danube in full armour. But most of the survivors were captured. Their defeat 
left Bulgaria in Muslim hands for 500 years, ended the Latin challenge in the 
East, and presaged the fall of Constantinople. 

Enguerrand de Coucy VII (1340-97), Count of Soissons, has been taken 
as a man whose biography encapsulates the 'crisis of Christendom'. Lord of 
the largest castle in Europe, at Coucy in Picardy, and a patron both of 
Froissart and Chaucer, he was personally involved in almost all the 
catastrophes of a catastrophic age. His father was probably killed at Crecy. 
His mother, a Habsburg, died of the Black Death. After Poitiers he spent five 
years as a hostage in England, where he married the King's daughter. He 
fought alongside Hawkswood, the condottiere, in Savoy, against the 'Free 
Companies' which infested France, and in the Swiss campaign of 1375-6. 
He was the first ashore at Tunis (1390). He loyally served a rotten French 
monarchy in all the contortions of imperial rivalry and the papal schism. 
When Hungarian envoys arrived in Paris, calling for a crusade 'in the name 
of kinship and the love of God', he eagerly volunteered. 1 


It was in this period that the Muscovites began to call their state by the Greek 
name for Rus', Rossiya (Russia), and to call themselves Russians. These 
Muscovite-Russians had never ruled over Kiev; but the disability did not prevent 
them from regarding Moscow as the sole legitimate heir of the Kievan 
succession. It was their variant of east Slav speech that provided the roots of the 
modern Russian language. Their tendentious version of history, which persisted 
in confusing Muscovy-Russia with the whole of Rus', was not accepted by those 
other east Slavs who remained beyond Moscow's rule for centuries to come. 




The Lithuanians were the last pagans of Europe. Secure in their remote 
Baltic forests, they escaped both the initial advance of the Teutonic Knights and 
the Mongol conquest. They were ruled by Baltic warrior princes who recognized 
a historic opportunity in the disintegration of the Kievan state. Hence, at the 
same time that Moscow was consolidating the northern and eastern remnants of 
Rus', Lithuania began its takeover of the western and southern remnants. Three 
great leaders stand out in a state-building exercise that, in the period, outstripped 
even the Muscovite effort-Grand Duke Gediminas (c. 1275-1341), his son 
Algirdas (r. 1345-77), and Jogaila (r. 1377-1434), who launched the historic 
union with Poland. A century of raiding, castle-building, and tribute-gathering 
brought spectacular results throughout the vast Dnieper basin. White Ruthenia 
(now Belarus') was absorbed whole. Red Ruthenia (or Galicia) was carved up in 
1349 with the Poles. Kiev was taken in 1362, after Algirdas had broken the 
Mongol grip at the Battle of the Blue Water in the Dnieper bend. In 1375 he took 
Polotsk. The Lithuanians were not checked until in 1399 they were defeated by 
the Tartars in the far south, on the River Vorksla. By that time Lithuania 
stretched virtually 'from sea to shining sea', from the Baltic to the Black Sea 
approaches. From 1386 its ruling circles were converted to Roman Catholicism 
(see p. 430), and were increasingly polonized. But the mass of the population, in 
White Ruthenia and Ukraine, were Orthodox Slavs. They called themselves 
rusini or 'Ruthenes'; and it is the Ruthenian variants of east Slav speech from 
the Grand Duchy of Lithuania that provided the roots of the modern 
Byelorussian and Ukrainian languages. Until 1700 the official language of the 
Grand Duchy, which was largely administered by literate Christian Slavs, was 
not Lithuanian but Ruthenian. 

At first sight the Orthodox Church was necessarily more passive than its 
Catholic counterpart. Its head, the Patriarch of Constantinople, was closely 
bound to the fate of the Byzantine Empire. Yet its role was not trivial. It was the 
stubborn determination of the Orthodox Church in the East, where Christendom 
was under attack from Mongols and Turks, which sowed the seeds of modern 
nationhood among the Serbs, Bulgars, and Romanians of the Balkans, among the 
Russians of Muscovy, and among the Ruthenes of Lithuania. 

At the other end of the Peninsula, in Spain, the Reconquista was virtually 
suspended. (See Appendix III, p. 1241.) After 1248 the Moorish armies had 
retreated to the Sierra Nevada, in whose shadow the emirate of Granada could 
flourish for two centuries more. Thenceforth it was the only Muslim-ruled state 



in Iberia. Beyond its borders local Muslim leaders, notably Ibn-Hud, had 
overthrown their African Moorish overlords and had established themselves in 
'Al-Andaluz' as dependents of Castile. The result was a broad frontier region, 
whose countryside was dominated by the estates of the military orders and 
whose towns were swelled by Muslim and Jewish migrants. The majority of the 
population were Spanish speakers, irrespective of their religion. The kingdom of 
Portugal, independent since 1179, controlled the Atlantic seaboard, where it 
conquered the Algarve in 1250. The kingdom of Navarre, which straddled the 
Basque districts of the northern Pyrenees, was subject from 1234 to French 
rulers, who maintained their independence until 1516. 

The victorious kingdom of Leon and Castile, having swept from the northern 
to the southern coast, where it surrounded Granada on all sides, was left in a 
state of internal anarchy. The first race of conquistadores grew rich from the 
plunder of the south and from the establishment of great latifundia. The 
successors of Ferdinand III the Saint (r. 1217-52), who was eventually 
canonized for his part in the Reconquista, were plagued by disputed successions, 
by fractious nobles, by the vagaries of the Cortes or 'diets', and by the 
hermandades or 'armed leagues' of the cities. Alfonso X (r. 1252-84) competed 
unsuccessfully for the imperial crown in Germany. In 1340 at Salado, Alfonso 
XI (r. 1312-50) achieved the first Castilian victory over the Moors for almost a 
century, and crossed the Straits to Algeciras. Pedro the Cruel (r. 1350-69) 
deserved the epithet. Henry III (r. 1390-1406) combined a talent for 
administration with an alliance with the Lancastrian kings of England. But he 
died young; and Castile passed under the despotic rule of the Constable, and 
Master of the Order of St James, Alvaro de Luna. Thanks to the sturdy, African 
merino sheep which grazed on the uplands of the Meseta or Plateau, Castile 
became Europe's principal exporter of wool, which was carried from Bilbao and 
Santander to Flanders. 

The kingdom of Aragon, in contrast, turned to the sea. (See Appendix III, p. 
1251.) Forged from the union of the Pyrenean district of Aragon with Catalonia 
and Valencia, it had gained an early foothold on the coast. James I the Conqueror 
(r. 1213-76) occupied Minorca and Majorca in the Moorish war, where he 
magnanimously gave Murcia to Castile. Peter III (r. 1276-85) was given the 
throne of Sicily in 1282 following the expulsion of the French. Sardinia was 
taken from the Genoese in 1326. Alfonso V (r. 1416-58) took southern Italy 
from the Angevins in 1442. Aragon's domination of the western Mediterranean 
created an inimitable maritime community, based on Barcelona, Palermo, and 



Naples, where Catalan was the lingua franca and where the nobles enjoyed a 
regime of remarkable liberality. Disputes between the monarchs and their 
subjects were referred to the Justiciar of the Cortes, usually a lowly knight who 
was raised by his peers to the office of supreme arbiter. In 1287, by the Privilege 
of Union, the nobles were empowered to take up arms against any king who 
infringed their rights-a liberty unequalled except in Poland. The result was a 
nation of unusual solidarity. 'It is as hard to divide the nobles of Aragon', said 
Ferdinand V (r. 1479-1516), 'as it is to unite the nobles of Castile.' In the 
fifteenth century Aragon controlled both the largest city in Iberia-Barcelona- 
and the largest city in Europe-Naples. 

The cultural synthesis of medieval Spain was something quite inimitable. In 
the five kingdoms, three main religions were practised: Christianity, Islam, and 
Judaism; and six main languages were spoken: Castilian, Gallego, Catalan, 
Portuguese, Arab, and Basque. The Christian population, dominated by the 
ranchers and soldiers of the central Plateau, was generally much rougher than the 
more urbanized and civilized Moors of the fertile south. But they were emerging 
from centuries of isolation, and were now in full commercial and intellectual 
contact with the rest of Christendom. The Spanish Jews, who had gained a 
foothold through the tolerance of Muslim rulers, spread throughout the Peninsula 
and played a prominent part in administration, medicine, learning, trade, and 
finance. They figured in many roles. The philosopher Maimonides of Cordoba 
(1135-1204), who had emigrated to Egypt, was long remembered as author of 
the Guide to the Perplexed. Samuel Halevi (d. 1361), chief tax-collector of 
Pedro the Cruel, who tortured him to death, was a patron of the arts. The convert 
Pablo de Santa Maria (Solomon Halevi, b. 1350) served as diplomat, Bishop of 
Burgos, and notorious antisemite. Earlier, disputations between the religions 
were popular. Later, and particularly in 1348-51 and 1391, ugly pogroms 
occurred. In the fifteenth century a large caste of conversos or New Christians- 
the Lunas, Guzmans, Mendozas, Enriquez-filled the highest offices of Church 
and State. Nothing conveys the symbiosis more eloquently than Spanish 
architecture, an exquisite blend of Mediterranean romanesque, Catholic Gothic, 
and oriental ornament.- [cabala] 

In the heart of the Catholic world, politics still revolved round the triangle of 
rivalries between the Empire, the Papacy, and the kingdom of France. In the 
course of the fourteenth century, each of the three main parties was subject to 



such tremendous local stresses that no international victor emerged. Following 
the interregnum of 1254-73, the Emperors were so absorbed by the internecine 
affairs of Germany that Italy was abandoned. The Papacy, overwhelmed by the 
wars of Italy, took refuge in the Midi for nearly seventy years before falling into 
schism. The kingdom of France, hopelessly overrun by the Hundred Years War 
against England, did not recover until the middle of the fifteenth century. By 
1410, when there were three emperors, three popes, and two kings of France, the 
leaders of Catholic Christendom were in despair. Such was the chaos in the 
centre that opportunities arose for the creation of powerful new states. Apart 
from Aragon, the newcomers were Switzerland, Burgundy, and Poland- 
Lithuania. 

The Holy Roman Empire was permanently weakened by the fall of the 
Hohenstaufen. The interregnum, which met its nadir with the execution of 
Conradin at Naples, ushered in decades of chaos (see p. 353). Worse still, there 
was little prospect that imperial power could be reasserted. By gambling so 
heavily on their Italian ambitions, the Hohenstaufen had condemned their 
successors to a position of perpetual subservience in Germany. With the imperial 
coffers empty, and the imperial domain dispersed, it could hardly have been 
otherwise. As a result the German princes perpetuated their privileges, and the 
elective constitution of the Empire became ossified. In 1338 the Electoral 
College rejected papal claims to confirm Emperors; and in the Golden Bull of 
1356 the mechanics of election were fixed for the duration. Henceforth 
Frankfurt-am-Main was to be the site of imperial elections. A majority of votes 
among seven named Electors was to be decisive. The seven Electors were to be 
the archbishops of Mainz, Cologne, and Trier and the princes of Bohemia, the 
Rhine Palatinate, Saxony, and Brandenburg.* The Emperor Charles IV, who 
formulated the Golden Bull, was bowing to reality. In Bryce's famous 
pronouncement, 'He legalised anarchy and called it a constitution.'- 

From 1273 onwards the enfeebled Empire struggled to recover. Of the nine 
emperors from Rudolf von Habsburg (r. 1273-91) to Sigismund of Luxemburg 
(r. 1410-37), only three attained the dignity of a full imperial coronation. Two- 
Adolf von Nassau in 1298 and Wenzel of Luxemburg in 1400-were deposed by 
the Electors. Henry VII (r. 1308-13), Dante's last great hope, aped his forebears 
by making a progress through Italy; he was shut out of Rome and died 
ignominiously of fever at Pisa. His successor, Ludwig of Bavaria (r. 1314-47), 
having fallen foul of the Pope, took Rome by storm in 1328; but his action only 
provoked yet another round of anti-popes and anti-kings. Charles IV of 


Luxemburg (r. 1346-78) brought a measure of stability. Upgraded from anti-king 
to Emperor, he used the Empire to build up his beloved Bohemia. Germany was 
ruled for a season from the Karlstejn. High politics was disputed between four 
leading families-the Bavarian-based Wittelsbachs, who also held Hainault and 
Holland; the Luxemburgs, who held Luxemburg, Brabant, and Bohemia from 
1310, Silesia from 1333, and Lusatia and Brandenburg to 1415; the Wettins of 
Saxony; and the Habsburgs of Austria, whose possessions spread across the 
south from the Sundgau to Carniola. Local politics were controlled by the 
ubiquitous predatory prelates, by the powerful imperial cities, or by the seething 
mass of petty knights. This was the age of the Raubritter, the robber barons, and 
the Faustrecht, the law of the fist. Late medieval Germany lacked the confident 
national monarchies which ruled on either side in France and in Poland. Not 
until the election of three successive Habsburgs, in 1438,1440, and 1486, did the 
Empire begin to assume the guise of a quasi-hereditary monarchy. And even then 
the emperors gained little freedom of action. If particularism is the measure of 
the feudal system, Germany was the most feudal country of all. 


CABALA 

Some time after 1264 but before 1290, a Hebrew work entitled Sepher ha- 
Zoharal ha-Torah, 'the Book of Splendour on the Law', began to circulate 
among the Jews of Spain. It purported to be the writings of a revered rabbi of 
the second century, Simon ben Jochai. In reality, it had been composed by a 
local scholar, very probably Moses of Leon (1250-1305). It took the form of 
complex and lengthy commentaries on the Pentateuch, and it was soon 
known to both Jewish and Christian biblicists. A definitive three-volume 
edition was printed at Mantua in Italy in 1558-60. It was, and is, the 
standard textbook of the Cabala. 

The word Cabala means 'the tradition'. It generally refers to a collection 
of mystical doctrines and techniques, which had been used for centuries to 
find hidden meanings beneath the literal text of the scriptures. The basic 
doctrines of the Cabala probably derived from neo-Platonist and Manichean 
ideas of the late classical period. They centred on the contending realms of 
Light and Darkness, the one ruled by God and the other by the Devil. God as 




well as the Devil consisted of paternal and maternal components, the male 
being white in colour and active in nature, the female being red and 
receptive. God's forms could be either abba (father/king) or imma 
(mother/queen); those of the Devil could either be Shamael, the poisonous 
Angel of Death, or Aholah, the Great Harlot. The intercourse of these pairs 
produced alternatively harmony or disorder. 

Since the Godhead and the Devil were judged boundless and invisible, 
they could only be comprehended by means of their ten emanations. Each 
emanation corresponded to one of the ten main members of Adam Kadmon 
(Primordial Man) or Adam Belial (the Worthless One). The ten divine 
emanations were: Kether (Crown or the head), Chochma (Wisdom or the 
brains), and Bina (Comprehension or the heart), which made up 'the 
intellectual world'; Chased (Mercy) and Din (Justice), the arms, and 
Tephereth (Beauty or the bosom), which made up 'the moral world'; Nezach 
(Splendour) and Hod (Majesty), the legs, and Jesod (Foundation or the 
genitals), which made up 'the material world'; and lastly Malchuth (the 
Kingdom). They could equally be arranged as the ten branches of llan, 'the 
cabbalistic tree', or in the Three Pillars: 


Comprehension 

Justice 

Splendour 


Crown 
Beauty 
Foundation 
The Kingdom 


Wisdom 

Mercy 

Majesty 


The Cabalists believed that God created the world after several abortive 
attempts; that everything real is imperishable; and that souls migrate from 
body to body. They looked for a Messiah who would come when the 
seductions of the Devil had been rejected. 

The techniques for decoding the Scriptures included notarikon, the 
attribution of words to initial letters within other words, gematria, the 
numerical equivalence of letters, and temurah or 'permutation cyphers'. 

Examples of notarikon would be ADaM, 'Adam, David, Messiah', or the 
famous Greek Christian ICHTHOS, 'the Fish', meaning 'Jesus Christ, God's 
Son'. 


Gematria operated by calculating sums derived from names and dates. 
One such sum worked out in the nineteenth century for Emperor Wilhelm I 
of Germany, born on 22 March 1797, gave: 22 + 3 + 1797 + 7 (letters in his 
name) = 1829 (his marriage): 



1829 +l+8+2+9= 1849(Suppression of Revolution) 

1849 + l + 8 + 4 + 9 = 1871 (Imperial Coronation) 

1871 + l + 8 + 7 + l = 1888 (Death) 

Temurah used twenty-four permutated sequences of the Hebrew 
alphabet. Its application to the four letters of YaHVeH or 'God', for example, 
produced 2,112 variations on the divine name. 

The Cabala profoundly influenced Judaic thought. It greatly strengthened 
the religion's mystical aspects, and undermined the rational study of the 
Torah. It was specially attractive to the Chassidim of a later age, who sang 
and danced to cabbalistic incantations, and who ascribed infallible truth to 
the oracular riddles and prophecies of their zaddiks. 

Many Christian scholars, too, from Raymond Llull to Pico and Reuchlin, 
were fascinated by the Cabala; and it became a standard ingredient of 
European magic. A Latin translation of the Book of Splendour, published by 
Baron Rosenroth at Sulzbach in Germany in 1677-8, made its secrets more 
widely accessible. Its ideas, images, and vocabulary permeated European 
language and literature, often unannounced and unattributed. 1 


In Italy, too, the Hohenstaufen left a bitter legacy. In the north, the warring 
communes substituted domestic for German oppression. All the cities of 
Lombardy and Tuscany fell under the control of one or other of the leading 
contenders-Milan, Florence, or Venice. This was an age of burgeoning 
commercial wealth and cultural splendour, but also of unending strife. The 
swordsmen and poisoners nourished alongside the artists and poets. In central 
Italy, a Concordat signed in 1275 between the Empire and the Papacy abolished 
all claims to imperial suzerainty over the Patrimony of St Peter. The Papal State, 
which, in addition to Rome, included the Romagna, the Pentapolis, the March of 
Ancona, and the Campagna, found itself free but defenceless. And it was 
eternally racked by the restless citizens of Rome. In the south, the Papacy's 
clients, the House of Anjou, which had been imported to replace the 
Hohenstaufen, became unbearable in their turn. The 'Sicilian Vespers' of 30 
March 1282, when the resentful populace of Palermo massacred perhaps 4,000 
of their French rulers, led to the introduction of Aragonese rule in Sicily, to the 
encirclement of the Angevins in Naples, and to a twenty-year war. [conclave] 




The city of Florence stood in the centre of the squalls and sun-shafts of late 
medieval Italy. Nurtured on the wool of its beautiful Apennine contado, it grew 
in the thirteenth century into a thriving community of perhaps 100,000 turbulent 
souls. Its gold coin, the florin, became standard currency far beyond Italy. An 
ambitious bourgeoisie, calling itself the popolo, organized in opposition to the 
traditional comune of the castle-based nobles of the contado-the Donati, Uberti, 
Cerchi, Alberti. The major and minor arti or guilds clamoured for a place in the 
city's elected councils and rotating magistracies; and a lusty mob added to the 
fray. The podesta or governor, once an imperial appointee, was brought under 
municipal control. Constitutions enacted in 1266,1295, and 1343 failed to quell 
the uproar. 


CONCLAVE 

The Roman Catholic Church is not a democracy. But its procedures for 
electing a pope are based on hard experience. The system of conclave was 
regularized by Gregory X to avoid the scandalous delays of his own 
appointment. Meeting at Viterbo at the end of 1268, the cardinals had 
wrangled for three years. Their prevarication so incensed the town 
authorities that the doors of the cardinals' residence were locked from the 
outside, then their roof was removed, and their diet reduced to starvation 
levels. 

Henceforth, the College of Cardinals was to assemble in the Vatican 
Palace in Rome within fifteen days of the death of an incumbent pope. (Prior 
to the age of telegraph and rail travel, this rule automatically excluded most 
cardinals not already in Italy.) The papal chamberlain was then ordered to 
lock their Eminences into a suitable apartment, usually the Sistine Chapel, 
and to keep them there con chiave -'with his keys'-until they had reached 
a decision. Voting could be by acclamation, by committee, or, as became 
customary, by secret ballot. In votes held morning and afternoon, each 
cardinal placed the name of one preferred candidate in a chalice on the altar. 
Each day, the chamberlain burned the voting papers of inconclusive rounds, 
sending a column of black smoke from the chimney of the stove. Voting was 
to continue until the successful candidate achieved a majority of two-thirds 




plus one. At which point the chamberlain released the tell-tale signal of 
white smoke, and the electors cemented their choice of the new pontiff with 
a sacred vow of homage. 

Gregory X's system remains essentially intact, modified only by the 
constitution Vacantis apostolicae sedis (1945). In the twentieth century, the 
workings of providence overcame a veto from the Emperor Francis-Joseph 
delivered to the conclave of 1903, and produced a record one-day conclave 
in 1939. Pope John Paul II was elected in October 1978, apparently at the 
eighth ballot and with a final vote of support from 103 out of 109 cardinals. 1 


Traditionally, Florence was a Guelph city resistant to imperial authority. But 
the Emperor's absence turned the city's energies in new directions. Relations 
with the Papacy were strained, and the Florentine Guelphs were themselves 
riven by faction. Florence gained local supremacy after the Battle of 
Campaldino, where on 11 June 1289 the forces of Ghibelline Arezzo were 
overcome following the earlier defeat by the Sienese at Montaperti (1260). But 
then the feud between 'the Blacks' and 'the Whites' took over. In 1301, after the 
failure of a papal arbiter in the person of Charles de Valois, the Whites, like the 
Ghibellines before them, were banished. This factionalism was the sure 
precursor of despotic power, subsequently exercised by the Medici. Florence was 
so full of poison, says one of the inhabitants of Dante's Hell, 'that the sack brims 
o'er ... Three sparks from Hell - Avarice, Envy, Pride- I In all men's bosoms 
sowed the fiery seed.'- 

Yet social and political turbulence seems to have stimulated cultural life. The 
three great writers of the era-Dante Alighieri, Petrarch, and Boccaccio-were 
all Florentines. The city's buildings reflected its progress to opulent self- 
confidence: the Bargello (begun in 1254), the new city walls (1284-1310), the 
Palazzo Vecchio (begun in 1298), the rebuilt Ponte Vecchio (1345), and the 
Foggia della Signoria (1381); the palaces of the Arte della Fana or Wool Guild 
(1300), of the Guelph Party, of the Pazzi, Pitti, Strozzi, Antinori, and Medici- 
Riccardi (1444); and, above all, the religious art-the romanesque church of San 
Miniato al Monte, the Gothic Santa Croce (1294), the marble-plated octagon of 
the Baptistery of St John (1296), the Duomo (begun in 1294), Giotto's 
Campanile (1339), Brunelleschi's cathedral dome (1436), Ghiberti's baptistery 
doors (1452), and the frescos of Fra Angelico in the Dominican convent of San 





Marco. 

Dante Alighieri (1265-1321) was the greatest of the poets of Christendom. 
He was deeply involved in Florentine politics, and walked the city's streets when 
its finest monuments were under construction. His literary and visionary powers 
are unsurpassed. As a youth, he had charged in the front ranks at Campaldino. 
He served as one of the municipal priors in the regime of the White Guelphs, 
only to be banished for life by the Blacks. Embittered by twenty years in exile, 
he died in Ravenna at the court of Can Grande da Polenta, who placed the laurel 
wreath on his fading brow. His Vita Nuova (The New Life) makes a rare 
medieval excursion into a man's internal emotions. His De Monarchia (On 
Monarchy) makes an impassioned plea for the restoration of imperial rule. In De 
Vulgari Eloquentia, his reasoned advocacy of the vernacular makes him the 
father of modern European literature. 

Dante's masterwork, the Commedia, a poem of 100 cantos, acquired the 
epithet of 'Divine' from its admiring readers. It describes the poet's journey 
through the three realms of the afterlife-through the Pit of Hell in the Inferno, 
the Mount of Expiation in the Purgatorio, and the sunlit Circles of Heaven in the 
Paradiso. At one level, like the Odyssey or the Aeneid, it is a voyage of fictional 
adventure, where Virgil is Dante's initial guide, and where a convincing setting 
is created for meeting the shades of people past and present. At another level it is 
an extended allegory of the spiritual journey of a Christian soul from sin to 
salvation, rewarded by a blinding vision of God. At yet another level it is an 
elaborate exercise in moral architecture, whose teeming inhabitants are precisely 
located according to their vices and virtues among the Damned, the Hopeful, or 
the Blessed. The language dazzles by its beautiful economy. The tales enrapture 
both by the quaint detail of the poet's encounters and by the grandeur of the 
moral landscape in which they occur. Appropriately, the lowest point of human 
experience is to be found where ah Love is lost-in the icy infernal depths round 
the frozen figure of Judas. The Earthly Paradise is reached in a fragrant grove 
atop Mount Purgatory, 'where pain gives way to hope'. The ultimate pinnacle is 
reached beyond the Primum Mobile, in the heart of the heavenly Rose of Light, 
in ecstasy too intense for words. This is the source of 'the Love that moves the 
Sun and other stars', 'L'amor che move il sole e l'altre stelle'. 

Dante was equally the source of vivid legend. One story tells how the poet 
heard a donkey-driver singing one of his songs, interspersed with shouts of Arri, 
arri!, 'Giddy-up!' The furious poet then made to strike the donkey-driver, 



shouting 'Cotesto arri non vi misi io' (That there 'giddy-up' was not put in by 
me!).- 

Dante's prime overlapped with the youth of Francesco Petrarca (1304-74). 
Petrarch's exquisite love poems, the Canzonieri, echo the spirit of the Vita 
Nuova, just as his devotion to Laura mirrors Dante's devotion to Beatrice. Both 
looked back to the founders of the dolce stil nuovo, such as the Bolognese poet 
Guido Guinicelli (1230-76), whom Dante called his literary 'father'; and their 
'sweet new style' was only one step removed from the troubadours. It is only the 
pedantry of critics which would categorize Dante as 'profoundly medieval' and 
Petrarch as 'the harbinger of the Renaissance': 

Di pensier in pensier, di monte in monte, 
mi guida Amor; ch'ogni segnato calle 
provo contrario alia tranquilla vita. 

Se 'n solitaria piaggia, rivo, o fonte, 

Se 'n fra duo poggi siede ombrosa valle, 
ivi s'acquieta l'alma sbigottita; 
e, com'Amor la 'nvita, 
or ride, or piange, or teme, or s'assicura: 
e T volto che lei segue, ov'ella il mena 
si turba e rasserena, 
ed in un esser picciol tempo dura; 
onde alia vista uom di tal vita esperto 
diria: questi arde, e di suo stato e incerto. 


(From thought to thought, from mountain to mountain, | Love leads me on; since every marked path | I find 
contrary to a tranquil life. | Where'er a river or fountain [adorns] a lonely slope, | Or 'twixt two hills a shady 
vale [is hid], | There the disturbed soul can calm itself, | And, as Love bids, | Either laughs or weeps or fears 
or is assured. | And the face, which follows the soul where'er it leads | Is tormented and serene by turns, | 
And stays little time in any one state. | Whence, on seeing it, a man learned in such a life | Would say: this 
one burns, and is unsure of his condition.)- 

Fourteenth-century Italy provided the breeding-ground both for violent 
municipal blood-feuds and for Europe's first merchant bankers. The former gave 
rise to the incessant depredations of the Free Companies-largely foreign 
mercenaries such as those of Conrad von Wolfort, of the ex-hospitaller Fra 
Moriale, of the knight errant John of Bohemia, or of the Englishman Sir John 
Hawkwood. Venice and Genoa were locked in perpetual maritime warfare over 
the Levantine trade. Rome, shorn of its popes, was racked by the oppression of 


its aristocratic factions and by the revolts of its citizens, notably in 1347-54 
under its visionary popular dictator Cola di Rienzo. Angevin Naples raged 
through the anarchy presided over by Joanna I (r. 1343-82) and her four 
husbands. 

Italian bankers learned how to profit from the conflicts. They devised all 
manner of modern financial techniques, from letters of exchange to insurance 
and accountancy; and by using the network of the Church hierarchy they 
extended their activities throughout Latin Christendom. Florence was rocked in 
1339-49 by the bankruptcy of its leading houses, ruined by overextended credit; 
but it recovered. Somewhere, in the midst of the wealth and the misery, the 
world of capitalism was born, [computatio] 

The late medieval Papacy, after a brief paroxysm of self-assertion under 
Boniface VIII, relapsed into dependency and exile. Boniface VIII (1294-1303) 
has been described as The last medieval pope'. He was elected in succession to 
the miserable hermit Pietro del Morrone (Celestine V), whom he had advised to 
abdicate and later imprisoned for life. He was intent on enriching his family, the 
Gaetani, on beggaring the rival Colonnas, and on restoring the Angevins to 
Sicily in the endless 'War of the Vespers'. None the less, he was responsible for 
the Sextus (1298), the third part of the corpus of canon law; and in 1300 he 
launched a jubilee year, with plenary indulgence for the million pilgrims who 
flocked to Rome. His Bull Unam Sanctam (1302) contained an extreme 
statement of papal supremacy, claiming that no creature could attain salvation 
without it. However, having picked a quarrel with France, for whose benefit 
Unam Sanctam was framed, he overreached himself. He died from the shock of 
being kidnapped at his native Anagni by the French King's agent. Dante, who 
may have met Boniface in person during a Florentine embassy to Rome, was 
totally unforgiving, calling him The prince of the new Pharisees'. In Inferno he 
consigned him to hell for simony. In Paradiso he puts the words of denunciation 
into the mouth of St Peter himself: 

Quegli ch'usurpa in terra il luogo mio, 
il luogo mio, il luogo mio... 


COMPUTATIO 




In 1494 Luca Pacioli's Summa de Arithmetica was printed and published in 
Venice. It contained the same author's treatise Particularis de Computis et 
Scripturis, 'On the Particulars of Accounting and Records'. In this work, the 
modern profession of accountancy received its first textbook. 

Pacioli (1447-1517), otherwise known by his religious name of Fra Luca 
di Borgo San Sepolcro, was a Franciscan friar and a prominent itinerant 
Florentine professor. His best-known treatise, De Divina Propordone (1509), 
was illustrated by Leonardo da Vinci. Recent authors have dubbed him the 
'Father of Accountancy'. 1 

The 'Venetian method' of double-entry book-keeping had grown up in 
the Italian cities some considerable time before Pacioli described it. It 
required three books-a memorial book, a journal, and a ledger. The 
memorial received a note of all transactions as they were made. The journal 
was made up from the memorial and summarised each day's business in 
chronological order. It had a left-hand column for debts in dare, and a right- 
hand column for credits, in havere. The ledger reserved a double page for 
each account, debits on the left and credits on the right, together with an 
index of accounts. It also contained a record of running balances, summaries 
of the merchant's assets, and lists of various categories of income and 
expenditure. As each account was closed, the closing profit and loss was 
entered in the main capital account, where the proprietor's net worth could 
be seen in the total capital balance. 2 

Systematic accounting methods are often seen as a pre-condition for the 
growth of capitalism. Their spread across Europe can be traced in the 
publications which followed Pacioli's. These included: Jan Ympyn

He who on earth usurps my see, 

my see, my see, which now stands vacant 
before the Son of God 

Has made a sewer from my sepulchre 

full of blood and pus-at which the Perverse One, 
who fell from here, takes pleasure down below.... 

In shepherd's guise, rapacious wolves 
are seen among the pastures. Oh, why 
do God's defenders lie so low? 

Gascons and Cahorsines prepare to drink 
our blood. Oh, fine principle, 
to what foul end is it fit for you to fall?- 

The 'foul end' of the Papacy turned out to be the long exile of the popes in 
Avignon, begun by the Gascon, Bertrand de Got, who reigned as Clement V 
(1305-14). 

The Babylonish captivity of the Avignon popes lasted from 1309 to 1377. It 
began at the instigation of Philippe le Bel, who pressured Clement V 
mercilessly; it ended at the instigation of St Catherine of Siena, who confirmed 
Gregory IX (1370-8) in his resolve to return to Rome. In the mean time all seven 
popes were Frenchmen, elected by a French-dominated College of Cardinals. 
Avignon, on the Rhone, did not lie in French territory but in an enclave of the 
Venaissin granted to the Papacy by its Angevin clients, and bought outright in 
1348 for 80,000 gold crowns. But French influence was paramount; and many 
acts of policy, such as the dissolution of the Templars, were dictated by it. The 
authority of the Avignon popes was not accepted in all countries. Latin 
Christendom was divided against itself in the most blatant manner possible. 

The manifest abuses of ecclesiastical power inevitably provoked strong 
reactions. One such reaction lay in the retreat into mysticism, with its emphasis 
on religious ecstasy and on the experience of direct communion with God (see 
pp. 436-7). Another lay in the proliferation of popular sects-all more or less 



unconventional in their theology. What they shared was a sense of betrayal by 
the established Church. Such were the Fraticelli, or Franciscan Spirituals, who 
held property to be contrary to salvation, the wandering mendicants, known as 
'Beghards and Beguines', the Brethren of the Free Spirit, the German 
Luciferans, who were Pantheists, the mystical Gottesfreunde or Friends of God, 
and the Lollards in England. All were bitterly persecuted by the Inquisition. 

Church reform could not be widely discussed given the political chaos and 
fear of the Inquisition. It had both theological and organizational aspects. The 
Englishman John Wyclif (c. 1330-84), sometime Master of Balliol College, 
railed against the wealth of the Church, rejected papal supremacy, and denied the 
doctrine of transubstantiation of the Eucharist. He was burned as a heretic, but 
only posthumously. The Czech Jan Hus (c.1372-1415), sometime Rector of the 
University at Prague, was much influenced by Wyclif. He stressed the concept of 
predestination, and the Church of the Elect. In Bohemia he became the focus of 
Czech resentment against the largely German hierarchy. Hus, excommunicated, 
appealed to a General Council of the Church. Though they lacked the name, 
Wyclif and Hus were the pioneer Protestants, [magic] 

Switzerland, die Schweiz, takes its name from the district of Schwyz on Lake 
Lucerne, one of three cantons that began to assert their separate political identity 
against the German Empire in the late thirteenth century. In 1291 Schwyz, Uri, 
and Unterwalden signed an 'Everlasting League' of self-defence, swearing to 
assist each other against outside interference. In this way they sought to break 
free of the local counts, the Habsburgs, who had tried to impose servile judges 
on the free men of the valleys. In 1315, at the battle of Morgarten, a Habsburg 
army was routed, and the League became the nucleus for other disaffected 
districts. The first of these was Luzern (1331) whose advent created the 
Vierwaldstaette of Tour Forest Cantons'. After that came the Imperial city of 
Zurich (1351), Glarus (1351), Zug (1352), and the powerful city-state of Bern 
(1353). Another Habsburg defeat, at Sempach in 1386, where dismounted 
knights were cut to pieces by Swiss halberdiers, established the cantons' 
practical independence. (See Appendix III, p. 1257.) 

In the mid-fifteenth century the Habsburgs fomented a civil war by 
supporting Zurich against its neighbours. But a crushing Swiss victory over 
Burgundy in 1474-6, when the red flag with white cross was first carried, 
brought another train of members-Fribourg and Solothurn (1481), Basle and 



Schaffhausen (1501), and Appenzell (1513). By then, Switzerland stretched from 
the Jura in the west to Tyrol in the east. There were extensive 'subject' and 
'protected' territories, including the Vaud round Lake Geneva, the Valais on the 
upper Rhone, the Ticino as far south as Lake Lugano, and the Graubunden or 
Grisons, the 'Grey Leagues', to the east. There were German-speakers, French- 
speakers, Italian-speakers, and speakers of Romansch. Yet apart from the 
Compact of Stans (1481), which regulated the network of mutual alliances, there 
were no common institutions. Though the Empire recognized the League's 
existence by the Treaty of 1499, there had been no formal declaration of 
independence. The Swiss had proved themselves the finest soldiers in Europe, 
widely in demand as mercenaries. The Switzers or Swiss Guard of the Vatican, 
with costumes by Michelangelo, date from 1516. 

South and west of Switzerland, the ancient House of Savoy was 
consolidating its own alpine territories. Amadeus V (r. 1285-1323) reunited the 
county of Savoy round Chambery with the principality of Piedmont at Turin. 
Amadeus VT (r. 1343-83)> the Conte Verde, a crusader, introduced a system of 
state-supported poor relief. Amadeus VIII (r. 1391-1440) lived in the hermitage 
of Ripaille on Lake Geneva. The Emperor made him a Duke, and the Council of 
Basle elected him the last anti-pope, as Felix V (1439-49). 

Given the disarray of the Empire and the Papacy, the kingdom of France faced 
the first of several historic opportunities to become the dominant power in 
Europe. As the heirs of St Louis, the last three generations of Capetian kings- 
Philippe III le Hardi (r. 1270-85), Philippe IV le Bel (r. 1285-1314), and the 
latter's three sons, Louis X (r. 1314-16), Philippe V (r. 1316-22), and Charles IV 
(r. 1322-8)-ruled a large population which was growing in numbers and 
prosperity and was well administered. That they failed to press home their 
advantage can be attributed partly to the disputed succession, partly to their 
minous rivalry with England, and partly to the pestilence. 


MAGIC 


The 'Twelve Conclusions' of the Lollards of 1395 contains a direct attack 
on the medieval English Church's involvement with magic. The Protestant 




movement contained a very strong impulse 'to take the magic out of 
religion', and this very first manifestation of Protestantism demonstrated the 
impulse in no uncertain manner: 

That exorcisms and hallowings, made in the Church, of wine, bread and wax, water, salt and oil and 
incense, the stone of the altar, upon vestments, mitre, cross and pilgrims' staves, be the very practice of 
necromancy, not of holy theology. For ... we see nothing of change in no such creatures that is so 
charmed, except by false belief, which is the principle of the devil's craft . 1 

None the less, in the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries 
Europe continued to be devoted to every form of magical belief. The 
landscape was filled with alchemists, astrologers, diviners, conjurers, 
healers, and witches, [alchemia] [hexen] [Nostradamus] The countryside 
was populated with ghosts, fairies, hobgoblins, and elves. Wyclif, the 
Lollards' guru, translated the Bible into English to make it accessible to all. 
Yet 300 years later, in Cromwell's Puritan England, the sales charts were 
topped by William Lilly's astrological almanac, the Merlinus Anglicus, and 
by his Collection of Ancient and Moderne Prophecies. 2 Magic and religion 
were often inseparable. People who venerated the Christian saints also 
believed in Puck and Queen Mab and Merlin the Magician. Magic held its 
own throughout the Reformation era. 

In this respect, therefore, the Protestant onslaught on magic enjoyed only 
partial success, even in countries where Protestantism was to be nominally 
triumphant. But the intentions of the radicals were unmistakable. After 
Wyclif came Luther's attack on indulgences (see p. 484) and Calvin's 
dismissal of transubstantiation as 'conjury'. Every aspect of religious life 
with the slightest supernatural connotation came under suspicion. Protestants 
abhorred oaths, miracles, consecrations, symbols, images, holy water, saints' 
days, processions, pilgrimages. Moreover, since Protestant Christianity was 
supposedly magic-free, Protestantism's enemy, 'Popery', was judged 
equivalent to black magic; the Pope was a wizard; and the Catholic Mass 
was a branch of devil-worship. 

In reality, such views contained a high dose of hypocrisy. Despite all 
manner of statutes and reforms, the Protestant clergy could not avoid finding 
a modus vivendi with magic. Anglicans and Lutherans would stay closer to 
sacramental religion than did Calvinists, Anabaptists, and other evangelicals. 
But it proved difficult to abandon the sign of the Cross, oaths in court, or the 
'churching' of women after childbirth. It proved virtually impossible to 



abandon the consecration of church buildings, of battle standards, of food, of 
ships, and of burial grounds. Protestantism was due to create a new form of 
Christianity, with the emphasis on conscious belief; but magic was never 
eliminated. 

The decline of magic did not really commence until the latter part of the 
seventeenth century. It has been attributed to the Scientific Revolution (see 
pp. 507-10), to the consequent rise of rationalism, to modern medicine, to 
mathematics and a greater understanding of probability, and to a social 
environment which gradually grew less threatening. [Lloyd's] Yet belief in 
magic, and its interdependence with religion, has never died out. In the 
twentieth century, horoscopes are ubiquitous. In the land of the Lollards, 
sacramental magic was revived in the newfangled rituals of the British 
monarchy, reaching a pinnacle in the coronation of 1953. 3 In Catholic 
countries such as Poland and Italy, priests bless everything from motor cars 
to football mascots. The Vatican still holds with faith-healing and 
prophecies, [Bernadette] [fatima] Even in Russia, where Communism 
decimated Orthodox religion, belief in astrology and fairies could not be 
purged. 

The study of magic and religion is inevitably coloured by prejudices and 
preferences. Ever since Frazer's Golden Bough, scientific anthropologists 
have tried to act with impartiality. But scholars cannot always resist the 
temptation to denigrate other people's magic. That may be a form of 
superstition in itself, [aricia] 


Philippe le Bel, grandson of St Louis, was fair of face, and unfair by nature. 
He was notorious for minting debased coinage and for extorting ingenious taxes. 
His one act of successful territorial aggrandisement-the incorporation of the 
city of Lyons in 1312-was undertaken by stealth during the absence of the 
Emperor in Italy. His confrontation with the Papacy, which led to the scandal of 
Anagni, began over money. When faced with the Bull Clericis laicos, whereby 
Pope Boniface had sought to prevent him taxing the clergy, he simply banned the 
export of all money. His vendetta against the Templars, which ended with their 
proscription, was rooted in envy and pursued with malice. Their trial, 1307-12, 
was marked by fiendish accusations about leagues with the Devil or with the 
infidel, by confessions extracted under torture, and in the end by legalized 




murder and state robbery. The death of the last Grand Master, Jacques de Molai, 

burned at the stake in Paris after retracting all his confessions, left a lasting stain. 
[ANGELUS] 

Yet Philippe le Bel was the author of durable institutions. With the aid of his 
legistes or legal counsellors, he found all manner of pretexts to fleece his 
subjects, to institutionalize his depredations, and to cloak them in the guise of a 
national consensus. His guiding principle lay in the Roman adage quod principi 
placuit legis habet vigorem (whatever pleases the king has the force of law). The 
old royal court was divided into three branches: The royal council governed the 
kingdom; the chambre des comptes, or exchequer, managed its finances; the 
parlement was charged with royal justice, and with registering all royal edicts. 
(It was not a true parliament.) The Estates-General, which first met in 1302, 
summoned nobles, clergy, and commoners to approve royal policy. Philippe le 
Bel died opportunely, thereby avoiding a popular outburst; but much of his 
administrative machinery survived till 1789. 

In 1316 the Capetian succession was thrown into confusion. The three sons 
of Philippe le Bel had produced six daughters between them, but no male heir. 
When Louis X le Hutin (the Quarrelsome) died suddenly, he left one daughter, a 
pregnant queen, and an unborn child, who, as Jean I the Posthumous, lived and 
reigned for less than a week. The ultimate outcome was the so-called Salic Law, 
which the lawyers of Louis's brothers devised to exclude their sister (and all 
subsequent females of the Lrench royal house). But in 1328, when the throne 
passed to the founder of a new line, Philippe de Valois, the succession was 
inevitably challenged. The challenger was Philippe le Bel's only surviving 
grandson, Edward III, King of England, [montaillou] 


ANGELUS 

Whilst preaching the Lirst Crusade, Pope Urban II had urged the faithful 
to recite the 'Angelus' three times daily. The Blessed Virgin was patroness of 
the Crusaders; and the prayer which begins Angelus Domini nuntiavit 
Mariae ('The Angel of the Lord announced to Mary') was already the 
standard invocation to the Virgin. The Pope's proposal was largely ignored. 
But the cathedral church of Saint-Pierre at Saintes in Poitou was an 




exception. Not only did the clergy of Saintes recite the Angelus regularly; 
they established the practice of sounding a bell at sunrise, noon, and sunset 
to announce the commencement of their devotions. 

According to local tradition, Pope John XXII renewed the appeal of his 
predecessor in 1318, ordering the custom of Saintes to be adopted 
throughout the universal Church. 1 Other authorities point to the pontificate 
of Callistus III in 1456. At all events, the sound of the angelus bell was to 
become as characteristic for the towns and villages of Latin Christendom as 
the sound of the muezzin in Islam. The Middle Ages was a world without 
background noise. There were no factories, no engines, no traffic, no radio, 
no musak. Sound had not been devalued. In the narrow, crowded streets of 
tiny towns, vendors' cries mingled with the bustle of artisans' workshops. 
But in the vast open countryside, the sounds of nature were largely 
undisturbed. The only serious competition for the church bell came from the 
wind in the trees, the lowing of cattle, and the distant clang of the 
blacksmith's forge, [sound] 


England under three Edward Plantagenets-Edward I (r. 1272-1307), 
Edward II (r. 1307-27), and Edward III (r. 1327-77)-saw only three reigns in 
more than a century. There was no lack of baronial discontent and foreign wars; 
and, since the Plantagenets continued to hold Gascony and Guyenne as fiefs of 
France, the territorial base was still fluid. But the wool trade with Flanders was 
booming, and the towns were growing. Under Edward I, in particular, there were 
concerted policies to consolidate the institutions of government, and to secure 
England's dominant position within the British Isles. The 'model parliament' of 
1295, which followed De Montfort's precedent thirty years before, summoned 
burgesses as well as lords and knights of the shire, thereby laying the foundation 
of the House of Commons. Magna Carta was reconfirmed. But in an amendment 
accepted during a parliamentary session on Stepney Green in 1297, the principle 
of 'no taxation without representation' was established. Thereafter, Westminster 
Hall became the permanent site of England's Parliament. Edward's writ of Quo 
Warranto (1278) had threatened the barons' landholdings: but the Second Statute 
of Westminster (1285), which favoured the entailing of estates, benefited both 
the monarchy and the tenants-in-chief. His conflict with the Church over Clericis 
laicos was controlled by the simple device of outlawing the clergy. His conquest 




of Wales, 1277-1301, which was held down by the chain of magnificent castles 
from Harlech to Conway, proved to be permanent. But his invasion of Scotland 
provoked the Scots' bid for total independence. Edward II, who understood little 
of his father's motto Pactum servare, 'Keep Troth'-was murdered at Berkeley 
Castle on the orders of his queen. Edward III fell into the endless struggle of the 
Hundred Years War with France. 

Scotland emerged as a nation-state much sooner than England did. The Scots 
had not been directly overrun by the Norman Conquest; and they reached a 
modus vivendi with the Gaelic clans long before the English came to terms with 
the Welsh. Scots monarchs and nobles had long been embroiled in English 
affairs, much as the English were embroiled in France. But they cut themselves 
free nearly two centuries earlier. The critical moment occurred during the 
decades of war which followed Edward I's intervention in a disputed succession. 
One contender, John Balliol (d. 1313), was imprisoned in England, then exiled in 
France. Another, Robert the Bruce (r. 1306-29), victor of Bannockburn in June 
1314, started as England's vassal and finished as Scotland's saviour. But none 
had a greater impact than William Wallace (1270-1305), who roused the 
commons of Scotland to resistance. Betrayed, and hanged in London as a 
common bandit, he was the martyrhero of Scotland's cause: 

Scots, wha hae wi' Wallace bled, 

Scots, wham Bruce has aften led, 

Welcome to your gory bed 
Or to victorie.- 

'We are resolved never to submit to English domination,' the Scots lords 
informed the Pope in the Declaration of Arbroath (1320); 'we are fighting for 
freedom, and freedom only.'- Their cause was finally vindicated in 1328. 

The wars of England and Scotland had direct repercussions in Ireland. In 
1297, Edward I's viceroy in Dublin, Sir John Wogan, had set up an Irish 
parliament in imitation of the 'model parliament' in London. But the English 
defeat at Bannockburn gave the Irish lords the opportunity to rebel, and for three 
years, 1315-18, they accepted a Scottish Bruce as king. Subsequent decades of 
turmoil were not brought to an end until the Statute of Kilkenny (1366) limited 
English rule and the English language to Dublin and to a surrounding Pale of 
Settlement. 


The 'Black Death' of 1347-50 stopped Europe's petty troubles in their tracks. 
Here was a pandemic of plague such as the world had not seen since the sixth 
century and was not destined to see again till the 1890s. It was fuelled by a 
devastating brew of three related diseases-bubonic plague, septicaemic plague, 
and pneumonic or pulmonary plague. The first two variants were carried by fleas 
hosted by the black rat; the third, airborne variant was especially fast and lethal. 
In its most common bubonic form, the bacillus pasteurella pestis caused a boil¬ 
like nodule or bubo in the victim's groin or armpit, together with dark blotches 
on the skin from internal haemorrhage. Three or four days of intolerable pain 
preceded certain death if the bubo did not burst beforehand. 

Medieval medicine, though generally conscious of infection and contagion, 
did not comprehend the particular mechanisms of the plague's transmission. 
Doctors watched in anguish. Crowded tenements and poor sanitation, especially 
in the towns, provided excellent encouragement for the rats. The result was mass 
mortality. Boccaccio wrote that 100,000 died in Florence alone. Eight hundred 
corpses a day had to be buried in Paris. 'At Marseilles,' wrote the cynical 
English chronicler, Henry Knighton, 'not one of the hundred and fifty 
Franciscans survived to tell the tale. And a good job too.'- 

The pandemic, which began in central Asia, spread with frightening speed. 
Initially it had turned east, to China and India; but it was first reported in Europe 
in the summer of 1346, at the Genoese colony of Caff a in the Crimea, which was 
under siege by the Tartars. The besiegers catapulted plague-ridden corpses into 
the city to break its resistance; whereupon the defenders took to the galleys, and 
rowed for safety. In October 1347 the plague reached Messina in Sicily. In 
January 1348 it reached Genoa, by way of a well-authenticated galley from 
Caffa. Expelled from its home port by the terrified citizens, the stricken galley 
sailed on to Marseilles and to Valencia. That same winter the plague struck 
Venice and other Adriatic cities, before moving on to Pisa, Florence, and central 
Italy. By the summer it was in Paris, and by the end of the year it had crossed the 
English Channel. 1349 saw it march northwards across the British Isles, 
eastwards across Germany, and south-eastwards into the Balkans. 1350 saw it 
entering Scotland, Denmark, and Sweden and, via the Hansa cities of the Baltic, 
Russia. There were few places which stayed inviolate-Poland, the county of 
Beam in the Pyrenees, Liege. 





MONTAILLOU 


Between 1318 and 1325 Jacques Fournier, Bishop of Pamiers in the 
Pyrenean county of Foix, conducted a campaign of inquisition into the 
revival of heresy in his diocese. In 370 sessions he examined 114 suspects, 
48 of whom were women, and 25 from the village of Montaillou. All the 
questions and all the answers were recorded in the Bishop's Register. 

Montaillou was a community of some 250 souls drawn from 26 main 
clans known as ostal or domus, living in perhaps 50 separate households. It 
sprawled down the hillside from the castle at the top to the church at the 
bottom. Its inhabitants were mainly peasant farmers and craftsmen. There 
was also a strong contingent of transhumant shepherds, who were organized 
into cabanes or 'folds' working the pastures and trails leading into Catalonia. 
Though officially Catholic, they were in large part secret Cathars, who hid 
the itinerant Perfecti in their barns and cellars. Their natural feuds and 
rivalries were intensified by fears of the Inquisition, whose arrests during the 
last visitation in 1308 had turned the village into 'a desert for sheep and 
children'. The Register has served as a sort of 'historical microscope', 
revealing every detail of the villagers' lives. 'Montaillou is only a drop in the 
ocean,' wrote its celebrated historian, 'but we can see the protozoa 
swimming about in it.' 1 

The twenty-two members of the ostal of the Clergues dominated the 
village. Old Pons Clergue, a die-hard heretic, had four sons and two 
daughters. One son, Pierre, the priest of Montaillou, was a flagrant 
womanizer who died in prison. Another son, Bernard, the bayle or manorial 
bailiff, eventually suffered the same fate after elaborate attempts to save his 
brother by suborning witnesses. Pons's widow, Mengarde, the matriarch of 
Montaillou's heretics, was none the less buried under the altar of the parish 
church. One of the priest's many lovers, Beatrice de Planissoles, a 
noblewoman, was first married to Berenger de Roquefort, the castellan and 
agent of the Count of Foix. Twice widowed, she became the accepted 
concubine of the priest's bastard cousin, Pathaud, who had once raped her. 
She took numerous bed-partners, even as an old lady, bore four daughters, 
and revealed all to the Inquisition. In 1322 she was condemned to wear the 
double yellow cross of the repentant heretic, [condom] 



The religious practices of the Cathars were heatedly discussed during the 
long fireside talks of the winter, and during long, intimate delousing 
sessions. They betrayed a two-tier system of morality-extremely severe for 
the Perfecti and extremely lax for the laity. At the end of their lives the 
former submitted to the endura, a last act of suicidal ritual fasting. The laity 
sought to be 'hereticated', that is, to receive the ritual consolamentum or 
'absolution'. 

The dilemmas inherent in a part-Cathar and part-Catholic community 
were illustrated by the incident of Sybille Pierre's infant daughter, who had 
been administered the consolamentum. The Perfectus forbade the sick baby 
to receive milk or meat. 'When [they] had left the house, I could bear it no 
longer,' the mother related, 'I could not let my daughter die before my eyes. 
So I put her to the breast. When my husband came back ... he was very 
grieved.' 2 

Everyday life in medieval Occitania exuded a special emotional climate. 
People could weep quite openly. They saw no sin in sexual liaisons that were 
mutually pleasurable; they were not driven by any developed work ethic; 
and they had a marked distaste for conspicuous wealth. They had large 
numbers of children to compensate for high infant mortality; but they were 
not indifferent to their losses. They lived in a complicated world of belief 
where magic and folklore mingled with Catholicism and heresy. And they 
were frequently visited by death. 

Bishop Fournier's career was not damaged by his zeal at Pamiers. He 
rose to Cardinal in 1327, and Pope, as Benedict XII, in 1334. His Register 
found its way into the Vatican Library. His most lasting monument is the 
Palais des Papes at Avignon. 


One of the best attempts to describe the plague was made by a Welsh poet, 
Ieuan Gethin, who saw the outbreak in March or April 1349: 


We see death coming into our midst like black smoke, a plague which cuts off the young, a rootless 
phantom which has no mercy for fair countenance. Woe is me of the shilling of the armpit ... It is of the 
form of an apple, like the head of an onion, a small boil that spares no-one. Great is its seething, like a 
burning cinder, a grievous thing of ashy colour ... They are similar to the seeds of the black peas, broken 
fragments of brittle sea-coal ... cinders of the peelings of the cockle weed, a mixed multitude, a black 
plague like halfpence, like berries .. .- 





Popular reactions to the plague varied from panic and wild debauchery to 
dutiful fortitude. Many who could flee, fled. Boccaccio's Decameron is set 
among a company of men and women incarcerated in a country castle for the 
duration of the plague. Others, losing the sense of restraint, indulged in orgies of 
drink and lechery. The clergy often suffered disproportionately from tending 
their flock. Elsewhere they left the sick to shrive themselves, the black flag 
flapping forlornly from the abandoned parish churches. The conviction reigned 
that God was punishing mankind for its sins. 

Calculating the losses is a difficult, and highly technical, task. Contemporary 
estimates are often, and demonstrably, exaggerated. Boccaccio's report of 
100,000 dead in Florence exceeded the total known population of the city; 
50,000 may be nearer the mark. Generally speaking, the towns were hit more 
severely than the countryside, the poor more than the rich, the young and fit 
more than the old and infirm. No pope, no kings were stricken. In the absence of 
anything resembling a census, historians have to base their calculations on 
fragmentary records. In England they use the court rolls, the payment of frank¬ 
pledge dues, post mortem inquisitions, or the episcopal register. Specific studies 
can suggest very high rates of mortality: the manor of Cuxham in Oxfordshire 
lost over two-thirds of its inhabitants;- the parish priests of England were 
reduced by 45 per cent. But it is hard to extrapolate any general conclusions. 
Cautious estimates suggest overall losses of one-third. That one European in 
three died during the Black Death ... cannot be wildly far from the truth.'- This 
works out at 1.4-2 million deaths in England: 8 million in France, perhaps 30 
million for Europe as a whole. 

The social and economic consequences of such gigantic losses must have 
been very far-reaching. Indeed, the Black Death was conventionally seen by 
historians as the decisive point in the decline of the feudal system in Western 
Europe. The second half of the fourteenth century was clearly a period of 
manorial dislocation, of languishing trade, of labour shortages, of urban distress. 
Yet nowadays specialists tend to argue that many of the changes were visible 
before 1347. Even basic demographic decline had set in at least thirty years 
before. This means that the Black Death was the accelerator of existing 
processes rather than their originator. At all events, serfs were increasingly 
commuting their labour dues for money rents, thereby creating a more mobile, 
and less dependent, labour force. Feudal vassals were increasingly commuting 
their military and judicial obligations for cash payments, thereby creating a 


phenomenon which in England has been called 'bastard feudalism'. Above all, 
in a labour market deprived at a stroke of manpower, wages were sure to rise 
with rising demand. The money economy was expanded; social barriers were 
threatened, [prostibula] 

The psychological trauma ran deep. Though the Church as an institution was 
weakened, popular religiosity increased. Charity foundations proliferated. 
Intense piety came into fashion: people felt that God's wrath must be placated. In 
Germany, huge companies of flagellants flourished until suppressed on orders 
from Avignon. Communal scapegoats were sought. In some places lepers were 
picked on; elsewhere the Jews were charged with poisoning the water. In 
September 1348 a trial of Jews at Chillon was supported by evidence extracted 
by torture. It was the signal for wholesale pogroms: in Basle, all the Jews were 
penned into wooden buildings and burned alive; similar scenes occurred in 
Stuttgart, Ulm, Speyer, and Dresden. Two thousand Jews were massacred in

PROSTIBULA 

The terminal period of medieval Europe, from 1350 to c.1480, 'was a 

golden age of prostitution'. 1 Prostibula publica, public brothels, were 
licensed to operate in most towns. A small place like Tarascon, with 500 or 
600 households, supported ten municipal whores. The Church did not 
protest: since the evil existed, it had to be channelled. Licensed fornication 
tempered street disorder, diverted young men from sodomy and worse, and 
broke them in for conjugal duty. After 1480, practice changed. Expensive 
courtesans served the rich, but many whorehouses were closed down. In 
Protestant countries, fallen women were liable to re-education. 2 

Throughout history, prostitution circulates through phases of licensed 
control, futile proscription, and unofficial toleration. 





Popular risings were a prominent feature of the period following the Black 
Death. Demands on the surviving peasants soared, and a decimated labour force 
resented attempts to hold down wages, as in England's Statute of Labourers 
(1351). A peasant jacquerie ravaged the castles and families of the nobility in the 
lie de France and Champagne before being cruelly suppressed. But the rash of 
risings in the years 1378-82, exactly one generation after the plague, does seem 
symptomatic of some general social malaise. Marxist historians have seized on 
the events as evidence of the 'timeless characteristics' of class warfare. Others 
have dismissed them as 'outbursts of anger without a future'.- 

Yet contemporaries had good reason to take fright when the endemic 
disorders of the towns were fused with more widespread violence in the 
countryside. In 1378, during the revolt of the ciompi or wool-carders, Florence 
was taken over for several months by riotous elements. In 1379 the weavers of 
Ghent and Bruges rose against the Count of Flanders in a vicious outbreak 
reminiscent of an earlier episode in the 1320s. Both culminated in pitched battles 
with the royal army, and once again, Ghent held out for six years. In 1381 
several counties of England were drawn into the Peasants' Revolt; in 1382 it was 
the turn of Paris: 

The ramifications of the movement were noted by a Florentine merchant, 
Buonocorso Pitti, who was present at the French court: 


The people of Ghent rebelled against their overlord, the Count of Flanders, who was the father of the 
duchess of Burgundy. They marched in great numbers to Bruges, took the city, deposed the Count, and 
robbed and killed all his officers ... Their leader was Philip van Artevelde. As the number of [Flemish 
rebels] increased, they sent secret embassies to the populace of Paris and Rouen ... Accordingly, these two 
cities rebelled against the King of France. The first insurrection of the Paris mob was sparked off by a 
costermonger, who, when an official tried to levy tax on the fruit and vegetables he was selling, began to 
roar, 'Down with the gabelle.' At this cry, the whole populace ran to the tax-collectors' houses, and robbed 
and murdered them .... The popolo grasso, or men of substance, who in French are called bourgeois, 
fearing lest the mob might rob them, too, took arms and managed to subdue them.- 


ALTMARKT 

On Shrove Tuesday 1349, the Altmarkt of Dresden, the Old City Square, 
was filled with the smoke and flames of burning pyres. The Margrave of 





Meissen had ordered all the city's Jews to be burned, probably on a charge of 
spreading the plague. This veritable auto-da-fe is described in the 
Chronicum Parvum Dresdense. 1 

Six hundred years later, at 10 pm on the evening of another Shrove 
Tuesday, 13 February 1945, Dresden's Old City was illuminated by a 
phosphorescent Primary Flare dropped by a high-flying pathfinder plane of 
83 Squadron RAF. The Altmarkt had been selected as the base-point of the 
Target Area of the most destructive bombing raid in Europe's history. 

Despite the public stance, which affirmed that only military and 
industrial targets were selected, both the RAF and the USAF had followed 
the German Luftwaffe into a strategy of indiscriminate 'area bombing'. In a 
bitter controversy over the priorities of the Allied Bombing Offensive, the 
advocates of area bombing, led by Air Vice-Marshal Arthur Harris, had won 
out. The technique was to send massed fleets of heavy bombers repeatedly 
against one city, and to wreak a crescendo effect of devastation. 2 As Harris 
was to boast: 'We shall take out one German city after another, like pulling 
teeth.' The first 1,000-bomber Raid was launched against Cologne on 31 
May 1942. But the desired effect was not fully achieved until the night raid 
on Hamburg on 27/28 July 1943, when the resultant firestorm killed over 
40,000 people. 

Dresden, the capital of Saxony, had reached 1945 virtually intact. The 
medieval Altstadt was ringed by elegant squares and boulevards, lined with 
Renaissance and Baroque monuments. The Royal Palace, the 
Georgenschloss, dated from 1535. The Catholic Hofkirche (1751) 
commemorated the Saxon Elector's conversion to Catholicism. The 
Protestant Frauenkirche (1742) had been built to deplore it. 

Dresden was now selected for a Main Force Raid in response to Soviet 
requests for Allied air support. The city was the main reception centre for 
hundreds of thousands of refugees displaced by the Soviet advance, and for 
their relief teams, mainly young women. 

Ten minutes after the Primary Flare was dropped, the first wave of 529 
Lancasters began to arrive from the south-west on a flightpath of 68°. 
Undeterred by flak or fighters, they dropped a lethal cocktail of high- 
explosive blockbusters and incendiary clusters. Within 45 minutes, the 
firestorm was raging. Dresden's ancient heart, and everyone in it, was 
consumed. 3 



In the morning, as relief columns approached on the ground, a second 
wave of 450 Flying Portresses of the 1st Air Division of the US Strategic Air 
Force arrived. Fighter escorts strafed anything that moved. 

Huge discrepancies divide estimates of the damage. The British 
Bombing Survey reported 1,681 acres totally destroyed. The post-war 
Dresden Planning Report counted 3,140 acres 75% destroyed. The local 
Abteilung Tote or 'Death Bureau' reported 39,773 identified dead by May 
1945. This figure did not account for missing or unregistered persons, 
unrecorded burials, or the contents of numerous mass graves. It must be 
reckoned an absolute minimum. The chief of the Bureau later ventured an 
estimated total of 135,000 deaths. A British historian has suggested a range 
of 120-150.000. 4 No one knows how many uncounted corpses were 
disposed of behind the SS cordons, as an endless stream of carts fed the 
pyres blazing once again on the Altmarkt. 

The strategic impact of the raid appears to have been slight. Trains were 
running through Dresden within two days. Vital war factories, such as the 
electronics plant at Dresden-Neusiedlitz, were unscathed. The Red Army did 
not arrive until 8 May. 

An information battle ensued. An Associated Press report, later 
disowned, announced 'Allied air chiefs have made the long-awaited decision 
to adopt deliberate terror-bombings of German population centres.' A Nazi 
communique agreed: 'SHAEF war criminals have cold-bloodedly ordered 
the extermination of the innocent German public.' In the House of 
Commons, on 6 March 1945, Richard Stokes MP asked 'Was terror-bombing 
now part of official government policy?' The official reply was: 'We are not 
wasting time or bombers on purely terror tactics.' 5 

At 10.10 pm on 13 February 1946, church bells tolled in remembrance 
throughout the Soviet Zone of Germany. Of all Dresden's churches, only the 
solitary shell of the Frauenkirche, with its shattered cupola, was still 
standing. On that same day, ex-Air Marshal Harris boarded a ship at 
Southampton in a bowler hat, bound for a civilian career abroad. Though he 
received a belated knighthood in 1953, he was not honoured like his peers 
until a monument was unveiled in London's Strand on 31 May 1992. It was 
the fiftieth anniversary of the raid on Cologne. The Oberbiirgermeister of 
Cologne lodged a public protest: 'In my view, it makes no sense to 
commemorate war heroes like Arthur Harris', he wrote, 'although he fought 



on the right side and for the right cause.' 6 

Anticipating Dresden's own anniversary in 1995, Germany's President 
Herzog reflected further. The bombing of Dresden, he said, 'was an example 
... of the brutalization of man in war ... History written by individual 
nations in which each one selects what he has done well cannot be allowed 
to continue. If we really want to unify this Europe, then history must be 
unified as well.' 7 


USURY 

Early in 1317 in Marseilles, a certain Bondavid de Draguignan was 
charged in court for continuing to demand payment after the capital of his 
loan to one Laurentius Girardi had already been repaid. Bondavid was a Jew 
and a moneylender, and was suspected of breaking the laws against usury. 
Here was one well-documented incident amongst countless others which 
reinforced the medieval stereotype of the Jew as a heartless swindler. 
Bondavid was a real precursor of the fictional Shylock, whom Shakespeare 
immortalized two centuries later in The Merchant of Venice. 1 

Usury-the taking of interest, or of excessive interest, on money lent- 
was regarded in Christian Europe as both a sin and a crime. Churchmen 
pointed to Christ's teaching: 'But love your enemies, and do good, and lend 
nothing hoping for nothing again ... Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father 
also is merciful' (Luke 6:35-6). Repeated attempts were made to ban interest 
or, later, to limit it to 10 per cent per annum. 

Jewish practice, in contrast, whilst forbidding usury between Jews, 
permitted a Jew to charge interest to a non-Jew: 'unto a stranger thou mayest 
lend upon interest; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend on interest' 
(Deut. 23: 20). This distinction supposedly gave Jews an edge in the 
medieval money-markets, and loan business. It also gave rise to one of the 
sharpest points of antagonism between Christians and Jews, captured in 
Shylock's provocative aside about his rival, Antonio: 

I hate him for he is a Christian; 




But more for that in low simplicity 
He lends out money gratis, and brings down 
The rate of usance here with us in Venice.... 

He hates our sacred nation; and he rails 

Even there where merchants do most congregate, 

On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift 
Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe 
If I forgive him. 

(The Merchant of Venice, 1. iii. 37-47) 

In reality, the laws on usury were observed in the breach. Christian 
bankers could conceal high interest rates by not recording the sums 
borrowed, only the sums repaid. 2 Jewish moneylenders probably drew the 
greatest opprobrium because they concentrated on petty loans with the 
populace at large. Hypocrisy, and a measure of animosity, were perhaps 
inevitable, and one of the essential techniques of capitalism was inhibited for 
centuries. Even so, the prominent role of Jews in European credit and 
banking is a fact of history. 


The Peasants' Revolt in England cannot be attributed to the desperate rage of 
paupers. The chronicler Froissart said that the common people who led it were 
living in 'ease and riches'. Their demands for an end to servitude were made 
amidst improving material conditions. They harboured special grievances about 
a third poll-tax in four years; and they expressed a strong sense of moral protest, 
as befitted the era of the Lollards. Their fury was directed against the clergy as 
well as the gentry. Popular preachers, like the rebel priest John Ball, had been 
spreading egalitarian ideas: 'When Adam delved and Eve span, Who was then 
the gentleman?' 

For a few days in June 1381, therefore, it looked as though the entire social 
hierarchy was under attack. Wat Tyler and his men poured into London from 
Kent. Jack Straw marched in from Essex. They burned the home of John of 
Gaunt at Savoy House. They burned Highbury Manor, and a Flemish brothel by 
London Bridge. They strung up the Archbishop, and beheaded a number of 
citizens. At Smithfield they came face to face with the young King and his 
entourage; and in a scuffle Wat Tyler was killed. After that, they turned into a 




rabble. The ringleaders were seized and executed. The rest dispersed, to be 
pursued at assizes through the shires. No one cared to boast of their 
achievements. Chaucer, who had been present, never raised the subject; nor did 
Shakespeare in his play Richard II. Not till the nineteenth century did the Revolt 
receive sympathetic consideration.- [tabard] 

The Papal Schism, which lasted from 1378 to 1417, followed hard on the popes' 
return from Avignon. There had been anti-popes before, of course; but the 
spectacle of two men, both elected by the same College of Cardinals and each 
preaching war and anathema against his rival, proved a grave scandal. The two 
original claimants, Urban VI and Clement VII, could hardly be described as holy 
men. The former turned out to be a deranged sadist who read his breviary in the 
Vatican garden whilst supervising the torture of his cardinals. The latter, Robert 
of Geneva, had once ordered the appalling bloodbath at Cesena. In 1409, when 
both the Urbanite and the Clementine parties declined to attend a council 
designed to reconcile them, the College elected a third. The Schism was not 
ended until the Council of Constance dismissed all three existing pontiffs and 
unanimously acclaimed Cardinal Odo Colonna as Martin V (1417-31) in their 
place. 

The Council of Constance (1414-17) saw the culmination of the conciliar 
movement. Professors of the University of Paris had been calling for such an 
assembly for half a century. It was summoned by the German King, Sigismund 
of Luxemburg, and invitations were sent to all cardinals, bishops, abbots, 
princes, friars, teachers. Eighteen thousand clerics, fired with a mission of unity, 
converged on the tiny lakeside town. Among other things, they were supposed to 
limit papal power. They ended the Schism by confirming the election of Martin 
V as sole Pope. But they burned Jan Hus, on the grounds that an imperial safe 
conduct was not valid in the hands of a manifest heretic; and they did nothing to 
reform their own abuses. A further conciliar meeting, envisaged at Constance, 
finally met at Basle under the protection of the Duke of Savoy in 1431, and 
dragged on for years. But it fell into conflict with Pope Eugene IV, and ended by 
confirming the Duke himself as anti-pope. Ironically enough, the final outcome 
of the conciliar movement was to reinforce the conviction that the Church 
needed a strong Papacy. 


TABARD 


A statute of Richard II in 1393 made it compulsory for every inn in 
England to display a sign. The result is a great open-air gallery of 
picturesque names and signboards. 1 

Medieval inns were often connected with pilgrimages. Chaucer's 
Canterbury Pilgrims started from the tabard in Southwark. The tryppe to 
Jerusalem, which took its present name in 1189, is still extant in 
Nottingham. London's inns were decimated by the Great Fire of 1666. The 
thirteenth-century hoop and grapes in Aldgate claims to be the oldest 
survivor. 

Very many inn names denote the heraldic arms of their patron. Richard 
II's arms bore the white hart. The rising sun recalls Edward III; the blue 
boar, the House of York: the green dragon, the Earl of Pembroke; the 
greyhound, Henry VII. Many others were founded by crafts or guilds, 
hence the blacksmiths'arms or the weavers' arms. The beetle and wedge 
or the man and scythe recall craftsmen's tools. Connections with transport 
were legion. The pack horse, the coach and horses, and the railway 
tavern reflect improving means of travel. The blue posts in St James's, 
London SW1, marks an eighteenth-century system of litter stops. Sporting 
connections are also numerous. Some, like the hare and hounds or the 
falcon, refer to hunting, others, like the dog and duck, the fighting cocks, 
or the bull, to cruel sports long since banned. 

More modern inns have often been dedicated to popular heroes and to 
literary figures. These include everyone from lily langtry and lady 
Hamilton (WC2) to the artful dodger, eliza DOOUTTLE, and, in 
Bromley, the BUNTER. Historical battles, such as Trafalgar, gave frequent 
inspiration, as did the royal oak, which hid Charles II in 1651. Less 
dramatic events find an echo in the cardinal's error (the suppression of 
Tonbridge Priory in 1540), the world turned upside down (the discovery 
of Australia in 1683), or the torch in Wembley (the Olympic Games of 
1948). 



Corrupted names abound. The cat 'N' fiddle is reputedly a corruption of 
'Caton Ie Fidele', a knight who once held Calais for England, bag O'nails 
comes from the Latin 'Bacchanales' or 'drinkers', the goat and compasses 
from a Puritan slogan, 'God Encompasses Us'. Patriotic references were 
popular-hence the albion, the ancient briton, the Britannia, and the 
victoria. The antigallican (SE1) was the name of a famous man-of-war of 
Napoleonic vintage. 

But foreign countries are not neglected. The king of Denmark (Nl) 
recalls the visit of Christian IV in 1606. The hero of Switzerland 
commemorates William Tell; the angerstein honours the Baltic German 
who refounded Lloyd's; and the independent (Nl) the Hungarian leader 
Kossuth. The Spanish patriot in Lambeth was founded by veterans of the 
International Brigades of the 1930s, [adelante] 

None the less, an undecipherable residue remains. It is anybody's guess 
what to make of the magpie and stump (Old Bailey), the wig and fidget in 
Boxted, or the goat in boots (NW1). 


Italy evaded all foreign tutelage. In the fifteenth century Italy boiled with 
great prosperity, great turbulence, and immense cultural energy. It saw the zenith 
of the city-states, the city despots, the condottieri, and the early Renaissance (see 
Chapter VII). Unending municipal conflicts destroyed the oligarchic communes, 
giving the opening for local tyrants. Milan under twelve Viscontis (from 1277 to 
1447) and five Sforzas (from 1450 to 1535) or Florence under Cosimo and 
Lorenzo dei Medici (from 1434 to 1494) saw no incompatibility between low 
politics and high art. Venice rose to the peak of its power and wealth, winning 
extensive possessions on the mainland, including Padua. Naples was cast into 
the outer darkness of civil strife. But Rome, in the hands of ambitious and 
cultured popes such as the Florentine Nicholas V (1447-55), re-emerged into the 
sunlight. Italy was free to enjoy its own strife and splendours until the 
reappearance of the French in 1494. 

The 'Hundred Years War', whose conventional dates run from 1337 to 1453, 
was not a formal or continuous war between France and England. It is a 
historians' label, first used in 1823, for a long period of troubles, 'le temps des 
malheurs', which were constantly used by the English as an occasion for raids, 




jaunts, and military expeditions. (It is sometimes called the Second Hundred 
Years War-in succession to the earlier Anglo-French conflict of 1152-1259.) It 
was, above all, an orgy of what later generations were to judge most despicable 
about 'medievalism'-endless killings, witless superstition, faithless chivalry, 
and countless particular interests pursued without regard to the common weal. 
The scene is strewn with colourful figures. There were great knights such as the 
Breton Bertrand Duguesclin (c. 1320-80), Constable of France, or his adversary 
Edward of Woodstock (1330-76), Prince of Wales and Aquitaine, 'the Black 
Prince'. There were treacherous barons such as Charles le Mauvais of Navarre, 
rowdy adventurers such as Sir John Fastolf, and any number of unscrupulous 
prelates like Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais, who would formulate a 
theological justification of murder or an ecclesiastical show trial to order. Few 
emerge with much credit. Fittingly enough, the most influential personage of the 
war was Bishop Cauchon's chief victim Jeanne d'Arc, a blameless peasant girl 
who had heard mystical voices, who rode to battle in full armour, and who was 
burned at the stake on false charges of heresy and witchcraft. By that time, in 
1430, every memory of the origins of the troubles had been lost. Well might 
Charles d'Orleans (1394-1465), princely poet and 35 years an English prisoner, 
lament for his native land: 

Paix est tresor qu'on ne peut trap loer 

Je he guerre, point ne la doy prisier; 

Destourbe m'a long temps, soit tort ou droit, 

De voir France que mon coeur amer doit.- 

(Peace is a treasure which cannot be praised too much. /1 hate war: one should not hold it in high regard. /I 
have long been troubled, whether rightly or wrongly, / To see France, that my heart should love.) 


France's troubles were rooted partly in the dynastic problems of the House of 
Valois, partly in the waywardness of the great fiefs-notably Flanders, Brittany, 
Guyenne (Aquitaine), and Burgundy-and partly in the volatility of Paris. 
England's interest lay in the Plantagenets' continuing claims to the French 
throne; in their territorial possessions-notably in Guyenne; in commercial links 
with Flanders; and, above all, in the conviction of four or five generations of 
Englishmen that fame and fortune awaited them across the Channel. Potentially, 
France was always the stronger contestant; but English dominance at sea kept 
the island safe from all but France's Scots allies; whilst the technical superiority 
of the English armies repeatedly postponed a clear decision. As a result, virtually 
all the fighting took place on French soil; and the English were free to keep on 



trying their luck and their manhood. Even in the 1450s, after a century of 
adventuring, it is doubtful whether the English would have stayed away if they 
had not been caught by a great civil war of their own. 

Given the vast panorama, one should stress that six major royal expeditions 
from England, which start with Edward Ill's landing at Antwerp in July 1338, 
and end with the death of Henry V at Vincennes in August 1422, are somehow 
less typical than the smaller but more frequent provincial campaigns, and the 
rovings of independent war parties. The glorious English victories in the set 
battles at Crecy (1346), Poitiers (1356), or Agincourt (1415), though sensational, 
were less illustrative of the whole than the interminable skirmishes and castle- 
storming of the lesser actions. And they must be set against the shameful 
massacre of the citizens of Limoges by the Black Prince in 1370, or the wanton 
chevauchee from Calais to Bordeaux by his brother John of Gaunt, Duke of 
Lancaster, in 1373. They were certainly less decisive than the naval battle off 
L'Ecluse (Sluys), where 20,000 Frenchmen perished in 1340. The short-lived 
royal armies probably caused less devastation than the freelance war parties, the 
Grandes Compagnies of the nobles, or the murderous banditry of the routiers 
and ecorcheurs. The major diplomatic events, such as the Peace of Bretigny 
(1360) or the Congress of Arras (1435), were no more productive than the 
innumerable minor pacts and broken truces. 

The miseries of France form an essential backdrop to the main military and 
diplomatic events. The plague of 1347-9, which forced the third truce, was an 
important factor. So, too, were the jacquerie of 1358; the exploits of Etienne 
Marcel, draper of Paris, who took control of the Estates-General; the revolt in 
1382 of the maillotins, who literally hammered the king's tax-collectors to death; 
the butchers' mob of Jean Caboche, or the warring factions of the Burgundians 
and the Armagnacs. Ferocious murders were commonplace: Marcel, who had 
murdered the royal marshals in their master's presence in the Louvre, was 
himself murdered. Louis d'Orleans, founder of the Armagnacs, was murdered in 
1407, as was the Constable of Armagnac and their chief rival, the ex-crusader 
Jean Sans Peur of Burgundy, on the bridge at Montereau. The unhappy house of 
Valois sat uneasily on the throne. With the exception of Charles V le Sage (r. 
1364-80), a capable despot, they knew little repose. Jean le Bon (r. 1350-64), 
captured at Poitiers, died in English captivity. Charles VI (r. 1380-1422) passed 
thirty years in insanity. Charles VII (r. 1422-61), after years as Dauphin and as 
the hapless 'King of Bourges', survived decades in the shadow of Armagnacs 
and Burgundians before emerging as The Well-Served' at the head of France's 



resurgent administration, [chasse] 

The crux of the conflict was reached in the 1420s, a decade which started 
with the English rampant and ended with the French resurgent. After Agincourt, 
the young Henry V was busy organizing a new Anglo-French kingdom. By the 
Treaty of Troyes (1420) he controlled virtually all of France north of the Foire; 
and as son-in-law of the French King he was formally recognized as heir 
apparent to the Valois. After his sudden death at Vincennes his infant son, Henry 
VI, was proclaimed King under the regency of John, Duke of Bedford. Paris 
remained in Anglo-Burgundian hands from 1418 to 1436, with an English 
garrison in the Bastille. In 1428 Bedford laid siege to Orleans, the last royal- 
Armagnac stronghold in the north, and Valois fortunes were depressed to the 
point of despair. Yet no one had reckoned with that peasant girl, Jeanne d'Arc, la 
Pucelle, the maiden cavalier, who shamed the hesitant Dauphin into action. On 8 
May 1429 she charged across the bridge and broke the Siege of Orleans. She 
then led her reluctant monarch across Anglo-Burgundian territory to his 
coronation at Reims. By the time of her death in 1431, tied to an English stake in 
the market square at Rouen, the English tide was ebbing fast, [rentes] 

Thereafter, the tempo of the conflict gradually declined. Once the Congress 
of Arras in 1435 had weaned Burgundy from the English alliance, it was 
unlikely that England's fortunes would revive. The Ordonnance sur la 
Gendarmerie of 1439 at last gave the French kingdom a powerful standing army 
of cavalry and archers. The suppression of the Praguerie revolt ended Armagnac 
and aristocratic resistance. The last actions took place in 1449-53. When the 
Earl of Shrewsbury was defeated by artillery fire at Castillon in July 1453, and 
the gates of Bordeaux thrown open to French rule, Calais alone remained in 
English hands. In 1475, in a sort of coda, an English army landed in France 
expecting the support of the Burgundians; but it was bought off for a pension of 
50,000 crowns per annum, 75,000 crowns down payment, and the promise of the 
Dauphin's marriage to Edward IV's daughter. 


CHASSE 


Le livre de la chasse (The Book of Hunting) by Gaston Phoebus, or, to give 
its full title, Les Deduits de la chasse des bestes sauvages et des oiseaulx de 




proye (1381), is a remarkable social document, which inspired some of the 
finest illuminated manuscripts ever produced. It is best known in the version 
of MS 616 Fran^ais in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris. Its author, Gaston 
III, called Phebus, Count of Foix and Seigneur of Bearn (1331-91), was a 
colourful adventurer from Gascony, who had fought for the French at Crecy 
and for the Teutonic Knights in Prussia, and who had frequently entertained 
the chronicler Froissart in his Pyrenean castle at Orthez. It surveys all the 
species of game and the methods of hunting them: wolf, stag, bear, boar, and 
badger; bloodhound, greyhound, mastiff, and spaniel: stalking, coursing, 
trapping, netting, shooting, snaring, even poaching; every step from the scent 
to the mort is expertly described and illustrated. 1 (See Plate 30.) 

In the fourteenth century, hunting was still an integral part of the 
European economy. Game provided an essential supplement to the diet, 
especially in winter. The weapons of hunting-bow, sword, and pike-the 
horsemanship, and the psychology of the chase and the kill together formed 
an essential element of military accomplishment. Forest reserves, protected 
by fierce laws, provided an important item in royal and noble privilege. 

In the East, where both the forests and game were larger, and agriculture 
more precarious, the art of hunting was still more important. The historian, 
Marcin Kromer, writing in 1577, described a bison hunt in Podolia on the 
Dniester in terms very reminiscent of a Spanish corrida: 

Meanwhile, one of the hunters, assisted by powerful hounds, approaches, and draws the bison round 
and round the tree, playing it and teasing it until it drops from its wounds or just from sheer 
exhaustion. Should the hunter ... be threatened by danger, his colleagues distract the bison by waving 
large red capes, since red is a colour which drives it to a fury. Thus tormented, the bison releases the 
first man, and attacks the next one who is then able to finish it off. 2 

The development of firearms, and of agricultural production, gradually 
transformed the techniques and the social role of hunting. In England, for 
example, where the last wolf was killed in the eighteenth century, hunting 
had to centre on the fox, the arch-enemy of farmers. The ancient ritual, with 
the 'hunting pink', the horns, and the howls of 'Tally-ho', were preserved. 
But the original utility was lost. In 1893 Oscar Wilde could gaily portray the 
English country gentleman galloping after a fox as 'the unspeakable in full 
pursuit of the uneatable'. 3 Hunting and shooting had been reduced to a form 
of recreation. In the eyes of anti-blood sport fundamentalists, even angling 



would be added to the list of cruel barbaric survivals . 4 [konopiste] 

In Eastern Europe, hunting retained its social cachet somewhat longer. It 
was adopted as a status symbol by the top communist dignitaries. For them, 
as for Reichsmarschall Hermann Goering in the 1930s, shooting bison was 
the ultimate prize, the ultimate parody of feudal aristocracy. 


For France, the Hundred Years War was a sobering experience. The 
population had fallen by perhaps 50 per cent. National regeneration began from 
the lowest possible point. Under Fouis XI (r. 1461-83), the 'universal spider' 
and master of diplomacy, it proceeded apace, notably by his removal of the 
Burgundian menace. 

For England, the era of the Hundred Years War was crucial in the formation 
of a national community. At the outset, Plantagenet England was a dynastic 
realm which in cultural as well as political terms was little more than an outpost 
of French civilization. By the end, shorn of its Continental possessions, 
Fancastrian England was an island kingdom, secure in its separateness, confident 
in its newfound Englishness. The Anglo-Norman establishment had been 
thoroughly anglicized. With Geoffrey Chaucer (c. 1340-1400) English literature 
began its long career. Under Richard II (r. 1377-99) and the three Fancastrians- 
Henry IV (r. 1399-1413), Henry V (r. 1413-22), and Henry VI (r. 1422-61)- 
the wars in France provided a safety valve for energies left over from the violent 
struggles of monarchy and barons. Richard II was forced to abdicate, and later 
murdered at Pontefract. Henry IV, the usurper son of John of Gaunt, seized the 
throne with the aid of a false genealogy. Henry V was cut short in his endeavour 
to conquer France. Henry VI, another infant king, was eventually deposed. But 
underneath the blood-soaked surface of the political stage a firm sense of 
patriotism and national pride was building. No doubt it was anachronistic for 
William Shakespeare, writing 200 years later, to put England's finest patriotic 
eulogy into the mouth of John of Gaunt, who spent so much time and energy 
fighting over the spoils of France. But he was expressing a sentiment that grew 
from the conflicts of that earlier age: 

This royal throne of kings, this scept'red isle, 

This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars, 

This other Eden, demi-paradise 
This fortress built by Nature for herself 




Against infection and the hand of war, 


RENTES 

Cliometrics- the science of quantitative history-came into its own 
through computers. Previously, historians were often deterred by the 
immensity of surviving data and by the inadequate means for exploring 
them. Statistical samples were small; time-runs were short; and conclusions 
were tentative. The arrival of historical number-crunching removed many 
such inhibitions. 

The 'Section Six' of the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes in Paris, 
founded in 1947, was among the pioneers. One of their projects sought to 
establish the growth of Parisian ground-rents from the late Middle Ages to 
the Revolution. 1 The first stage, using 23,000 sets of institutional and private 
records, was to calculate average annual rents in livres tournois. The second 
stage, to compensate for currency deflation, was to convert the monetary 
figures into a series representing real purchasing power. This was done by 
relating the rents to mean, three-year cycles of wheat prices, expressed in 
seders or 'hectolitres' of wheat. The third stage was to plot the deflated 
'rent-curve' against sample soundings from a second, independent source- 
in this case, from the records of the Minuder Central or 'Main Notaries' 
Register', which was available from 1550. The resultant concordance was 
close (see Appendix III, p. 1263):

The Paris 'rent-curve' reflects both political events and economic trends. 
The low points, when rents were depressed, occurred, predictably enough, 
during the 'Joan of Arc Depression' of 1420-3, the 'St Bartelemy Basin' of 
1564-75, the 'Slump of the Siege' in 1591-3, and the 'Vale of the Fronde' in 




1650-6. The periods of recovery tended to be much longer-in the 
'Renaissance' of 1445-1500, in the decades of the Price Revolution after 
1500, when the rise in 'real rents' lagged far behind the whirlwind ascent of 
nominal rents, in the era of Louis XIV's stability up to 1690, and on the 
steady upward slope of the mid-eighteenth century. According to the 
computer calculations, the highest peaks were reached in 1759-61 (69.78 
seders) and in 1777-82 (65.26 seders). According to the Minuder, they were 
reached in 1788 (77.69 seders). 

The ultimate value of this data is open to question. The rent curve offers 
no insight into many key factors which affected the Paris housing market, let 
alone the French economy in general. It says nothing about the pressure of 
population, the size and quality of tenements, or the construction of new 
dwellings. Yet for the pre-modern age, where historians can only dream of a 
full range of statistics about prices, wages, costs, and incomes, it provides 
one modest index against which different sources of information can be 
gauged. Above all, it illustrates the hopes of economic structuralists, who put 
their faith in establishing the conjoncture, the overall pattern of underlying 
trends. In their view, the conjoncture is the foundation on to which all other 
historical facts are to be fitted. 


This happy breed of men, this little world, 

This precious stone set in a silver sea, 

... This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England.- 

It was in France that the English performed those exploits which cemented the 
spirit of their common patriotism. Where but before Harfleur, on the eve of 
Agincourt, could Shakespeare have set the speech which ever since has called on 
the 'noblest English' to hold the breach? 

Within England's island kingdom, the Welsh formed the only community 
which could not be fully assimilated. In 1400-14, at the height of the French 
Wars, they staged a promising rebellion with links to the King's other enemies in 
Northumbria, Ireland, Scotland, and France. Under Owain ap Gruffydd, Lord of 
Glyndyvrdwy (c.1359-1416), who was known to the English as 'Owen 
Glendower', they revived the vision of a liberated Wales, and briefly 
reconstituted an independent principality. In 1404-5 a sovereign Welsh 





parliament was summoned to Machynlleth. Within a decade, however, the 
enterprise was crumbling. Its fate was sealed by the English victory at 
Agincourt. After that, the royal castles in Wales were gradually recovered, and 
Glendower's son was forced to submit. Henceforth, though culturally and 
linguistically impervious, Wales was to form an integral part of the English 
realm. 

From 1450 onwards England was laid low by a fratricidal war reminiscent of 
that between the Burgundians and the Armagnacs. An insane king and a disputed 
succession set the Lancastrians and the Yorkists at each other's throats. The Wars 
of the Roses did not leave England free to benefit from its growing prosperity 
until the rivalries of the three contenders-Edward IV, Richard III, and Henry 
VII-had been buried by the victorious Tudors. 

Again, it was out of place for Shakespeare to describe how The Blood of 
England shall manure the ground ... the field of Golgotha and dead men's 
skulls'. In reality, if recent research is to be believed, the fighting was rather 
gende-manly.- Except at Tewkesbury in 1471, prisoners were not generally 
slaughtered. Much of the action took place on the Celtic fringe: at St Michael's 
Mount in Cornwall, and in Wales-at Denbigh, Harlech, Carreg Cennen, and at 
Pembroke, the birthplace of Henry Tudor, who eventually triumphed. The scene 
at Bosworth Field on 22 August 1485-with the despairing hunchback, Richard 
III, crying 'My kingdom for a horse', as his discarded crown hung on a thorn 
bush-has become a cliche. But it gave a fitting end to English medieval history. 

One of the by-products of the Hundred Years War was the rise of Burgundy 
as a quasi-independent state of great brilliance. The eclipse both of France and of 
the Empire created the opening for a 'middle kingdom', which played a 
powerful role in European politics but which, lacking in cohesion, was 
extinguished as rapidly as it had flared. Though royal status evaded the four 
great Valois dukes of Burgundy-Philippe le Hardi (1342-1404), Jean sans Peur 
(1371-1419), Philippe le Bon (1396-1467), and Charles le Temeraire (1433-77) 
-their wealth and prestige exceeded that of many kings. Their initial holding, 
the ancient Duchy of Burgundy round Dijon, was granted to Philippe le Hardi by 
his royal French father in 1361. From then on, it was steadily expanded by the 
acquisition of numerous territories on either side of the Franco-imperial border 
(see Appendix III, p. 1281). Philippe remained essentially one of the French 
'princes of the lilies', together with his brothers, the Duke of Berry and the Duke 
of Anjou. But thanks to their English alliance his son and grandson were able to 


free themselves from their family ties. Philippe's great-grandson, Charles the 
Rash, overstretched himself in a bid to outsmart his neighbours. Their wealth 
derived largely from the flourishing northern cities-Bruges, Arras, Ypres, 
Ghent, and Antwerp. Their court was still itinerant, but apart from the Hotel 
d'Artois in Paris and the ducal palace in Dijon, they maintained important 
residences at Lille, at the Prinsenhof in Bruges, at the Coudenberg in Brussels, 
and at the castle of Hesdin in Artois (see Appendix III, p. 1260). 

The Burgundian court was the focus of an extravagant cult of chivalry, 
manifest in the ceremonies of the Order of the Golden Fleece and the 
enthusiastic sponsorship of crusading. Tournaments, jousting, banquets, 
spectacles, processions of all sorts were the rage. The dukes were lavish patrons 
of the arts-of sculptors such as Claus Sluter, of artists such as Jan van Eyck and 
Roger van der Weyden, of poets, musicians, romanciers, and of the famous 
tapissiers. They bedecked themselves and their courtiers in cloth-of-gold, 
ermine, jewels-all designed to impress and astonish. They were masters of 
diplomacy and, above all, of diplomatic marriage. Philippe le Bon once offered 
refuge to his cousin, the future Louis XI, only to watch the one-time refugee turn 
bitter adversary. Duke Charles was gradually caught up in Louis's political web, 
defeated by Louis's Swiss allies at Morat, and killed fighting the Lorrainers at 
Nancy. The Burgunderbeute or 'Booty of Burgundy' fills Swiss museums to the 
present day.- [codpiece] 

Charles's death in 1477 precipitated Burgundy's downfall and partition. 
Louis XI recovered the original duchy; but the lion's share fell to Mary, 
Charles's daughter, and thence to her husband, Maximilian von Habsburg. Their 
part of the Burgundian legacy-Flanders, Brabant, Zeeland, Holland, and 
Guelders-formed the basis of the future Netherlands, and the fortune of their 
grandson, Charles V, 'the last of the Burgundians'. Nothing remained of the 
Burgundian state; not even the magnificent ducal mausoleum at the charterhouse 
of Champmol, near Dijon, has survived. - 


CODPIECE 


After their victory at Morat in 1476, the Swiss soldiery plundered the 





Burgundian camp, captured large chests of elegant clothes, cut them to 
pieces, and held a mock parade in the tattered garments of their foe. This 
incident has been taken not only to explain the source of the fashionable 
'slashed doublet' of the sixteenth century, but to illustrate the military origins 
of medieval male fashion in general. 1 

At that time two other items of male garb were in evidence, both with 
explicitly erotic overtones. The poulaine or cornadu, the 'horned shoe', was 
literally on its last legs. Invented to facilitate standing in stirrups, its 
upturned point was later thought to demonstrate the prowess of members 
other than toes. The braguette or 'codpiece' was on its way in. Invented, 
according to Rabelais, to protect the genitals in battle, it was more likely 
devised to facilitate the armoured knight's call to nature. It has also been said 
to have protected the wearer's clothes from staining by greasy, anti-syphilitic 
ointments. None of which explains why it had to be flaunted in so 
exhibitionist a fashion for more than a hundred years. In As You Like It, 
Shakespeare wrote of Hercules, whose codpiece was 'as massive as his 
club'. 

Until recently many intimate garments, especially of underwear, were 
classed as 'unmentionables'. Polite historians ignored them. Nowadays they 
are the subject of learned dissertations and of lurid exhibitions. 2 


Many years later, a monk showed the skull of Jean sans Peur to Francis I, 
King of France, and reportedly said, 'There is the hole through which the 
English made their way into France.' One could equally point to the brainless 
ambitions of Charles the Rash: there was the gap that brought the Habsburgs into 
western Europe. 

For the time being, however, the Habsburgs were still on the make. Though they 
held the imperial title in Germany without interruption from 1438-Frederick III 
von Habsburg (1440-93) being the last emperor crowned in Rome-they still 
had not outgrown their rivals. Indeed, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries 
there was nothing to set them above the other mighty dynasties of the region. In 
the end, it was only by accident that the Habsburgs succeeded where the 
Jagiellons failed. 




For two centuries the rumbustious nobles of Bohemia, Hungary, and Poland, 
who held the right of confirming the royal succession in their kingdoms, danced 
an elaborate gavotte with the representatives of four great central European 
dynasties. They resembled nothing so much as the shareholders of old- 
established companies who seek an association with one or more of the stronger 
multinational conglomerates. In this, whilst assuring a measure of continuing 
control over their own affairs, they supposedly obtained both experienced 
management and effective protection from takeovers and mergers. In all three 
countries, the opening was created by the extinction of the native ruling house. 
The Arpad line died out in Hungary in 1301, the Premyslids in Bohemia in 1306, 
and the Polish Piasts in 1370. (See Appendix III, p. 1261.) 

As a result, east-central Europe passed into a long period of shifting dynastic 
consortia involving the Habsburgs, the Luxemburgers, the Angevins, and the 
Jagiellons. At first it seemed that the Luxemburgers would get the upper hand. 
They held the Empire in 1308-13 and 1347-1437, Bohemia 1310-1437, and 
Hungary 1387-1437. In the mid-fifteenth century the Habsburgs amassed a 
similar conglomeration, only to see both Bohemia and Hungary pass back to 
native rulers. By 1490 the Jagiellons controlled Poland-Lithuania, Bohemia, and 
Hungary, but not the Empire. Imperial or national histories of the period, written 
without reference to these wider connections, lack an essential ingredient. 

Bohemia was a special prize after its kings became hereditary Electors of the 
Empire. In their final phase, the Premyslids had taken hold of Austria-Styria- 
Carinthia, only to lose them to the Habsburgs at the batde of Diirnkrut in 1278. 
Later, Vaclav II (r. 1278-1305) obtained the crowns of both Poland and Hungary. 
After the Premyslids' demise, Bohemia saw periods of Luxemburg, Habsburg, 
and Jagiellonian rule. In the fifteenth century, the Bohemian crown was 
embroiled in extended wars both with the nobles and with the Hussites. The last 
native King, Jin z Podebrad (George of Podiebrady, r. 1458-71), gave his 
country two decades of fragile independence. 

The Hussites, who founded a national Czech Church, survived repeated 
attempts to suppress them. They appeared at a juncture when the Papal Schism 
was at its height and when Bohemia was rent by conflicts between Czechs and 
Germans, between kings and nobles, between the clergy and the Pope, between 
the University and the Archbishop of Prague. Their demands soon exceeded the 
theological and political propositions advanced by Hus. They were so infuriated 
by the news of his death, and by the excommunications hurled at the whole 



Czech people by the Council of Constance, that they launched what in effect was 
a national rising and 'the first Reformation'. They were divided into two main 
groups: the Utraquists, who took over the established Church from its largely 
German, Catholic hierarchy, and the radical Taborites, who founded separate 
evangelical communities centred on their fortified camp or 'Tabor'. 

Matters came to a head in Prague on 30 July 1419. A Hussite procession was 
stoned in the New Town, and the German burgomaster was thrown to the crowd 
from the window of his Rathaus. The Pope responded by announcing a general 
crusade against the heretics. Thereupon the Utraquists, who held that the bread 
and wine of the Communion should be dispensed sub utraque specie, 'in both 
kinds', promptly formalized their doctrine in the Articles of Prague (1420), 
whilst the Taborites took to the field under their marvellous one-eyed captain, 
Jan Zizka z Torncova (1376-1424). Year after year, huge invading armies of 
German crusaders were heavily defeated. The Hussites, who carried the struggle 
into Saxony, into Silesia, and into Hungary, suffered most from their own 
internal divisions. In 1434 a crushing Utraquist victory over the Taborites at 
Lipany enabled the victors to make their peace with the Catholic Church. 
Through the Compacts of Basle, they were able to keep an Utraquist church 
order in Bohemia until 1620. In the subsequent political settlement the Czech 
nobles attempted to run their own affairs by choosing a Habsburg infant to 
succeed the Luxemburgers and, twenty years later, by choosing the forceful 
Utraquist general, Jin z Podebrad. After Jirr's death, the Diet settled for 
Vladislav Jagiellon (r. 1471-90) to save them from the Hungarians and the 
Habsburgs. 

Hungarian history followed a similar pattern to that of Bohemia. In this case, 
after a brief interval under the Bavarian Wittelsbachs, Hungary was taken over 
by the Angevins of Naples. Charles Robert or Carobert (r. 1310-42) and Louis 
(r. 1342-82), known as Lajos the Great, established a powerful supremacy, only 
to yield to the Luxemburgers and the Habsburgs. The last prominent native king, 
Matthias Corvinus, ruled from 1458 to 1490. The first Jagiellon to be invited to 
rule Hungary, Ladislas of Varna (r. 1440-4), was killed fighting the Turks. The 
third, Louis II (r. 1516-26), died in the same way at Mohacs. 

Poland was heading for a grander and more independent destiny. After 182 
years of feudal fragmentation, it was reunited as a viable kingdom by Wladyslaw 
Lokietek (r. 1320-33) who, having visited Rome for the Jubilee, obtained a 
papal crown. Lokietek's son Casimir the Great (r. 1333-70), the last of the royal 



Piasts, established an efficient administration, a code of laws, and a coherent 
foreign policy. By resigning Poland's western provinces, notably Silesia, to the 
Luxemburgs, he freed himself for expansion to the East. His acquisition of 
Galicia and the city of Lwow in 1349 was Poland's first major step into the east 
Slav lands. His reception of Jewish refugees from Germany in that same year 
laid the foundation of Europe's largest Jewish community. The reign of Louis of 
Anjou was marked by the Statute of Koyice (1374) which gave the Polish nobles 
similar rights to their brothers in Hungary. Henceforth the power of the Szlachta 
grew inexorably. Most momentous, however, was the marriage of Louis's 
daughter Jadwiga, already accepted as rex in Poland, to Jogaila, Grand Duke of 
Lithuania, [szlachta] 

The union of Poland and Lithuania had wide international implications. By 
bringing together two large countries, both in a dynamic stage of development, it 
fuelled a powerful fusion, almost a new civilization. Its immediate rationale 
derived from the menace of the Teutonic Knights, whose activities were 
deplored no less in Cracow than in Vilnius. But much more was involved. 
Poland, which had recovered from the Mongol invasions and escaped the Black 
Death, was looking eagerly to the open spaces of the East. Lithuania, still ruled 
by a pagan elite and anxious about the rise of neighbouring Moscow, was 
looking for an entree into the mainstream of Christendom. Both were looking for 
mutual support. Here was a marriage, therefore, that far transcended the two 
persons most directly involved. Jadwiga, a twelve-year-old fatherless girl, bowed 
to her duty. Jogaila, a forty-year-old warrior-bachelor, whom the Poles called 
Jagiello, sensed a historic opportunity, which he could not refuse. 

Lithuania's baptism followed decades of vacillation between the Latin and 
the Orthodox options. Jogaila's father, Grand Duke Algirdas (r. 1341-77), had 
pursued a policy of 'dynamic balance'. Throughout his reign, he teased both 
Avignon and Constantinople with the prospects of a conversion. In the 1370s it 
looked as though he would take the Orthodox path in order to supplant Moscow 
as leader of the Orthodox Slavs. In 1375 he persuaded the Patriarch of 
Constantinople to create a separate metropolitan of 'Kiev, Rus' and Lithuania', 
in opposition to the older metropolitanate of 'Kiev and all Rus", now controlled 
by Moscow. Jogaila, too, had leaned towards the Eastern option. In 1382 he was 
pushed towards Moscow, when his disaffected brother began to consort with the 
Teutonic Knights. As late as 1384 a provisional treaty was concluded by 
Jogaila's Christian mother, Juliana of Tver, whereby Jogaila was to be betrothed 
to a Muscovite princess and Lithuania to Orthodoxy. The plans were probably 



ruined by the Tartars, who razed Moscow and destroyed the value of a 
Muscovite alliance. So, when the die was cast in favour of union with Catholic 
Poland, it was cast very suddenly. Jogaila reached agreement with the Polish and 
Hungarian-Angevin envoys at Kreva in August 1385. On 15 February 1386 he 
was baptized in Cracow, receiving the Christian name of Wladyslaw. Three days 
later he was married to Jadwiga. On 4 March he was crowned co-king of 
Poland.- (See Appendix III, p. 1262.) 

Oddly enough, when the sacred oaks were felled in Vilnius in 1387, it was 
not the last Christian conversion in Europe. At the time, the district of Samogitia 
or 'Lower Lithuania' was occupied by the Teutonic Knights, who did not care to 
take the same step. So the district did not receive its baptism until recovered by 
the Lithuanians in 1417.- Eleven centuries after Constantine, the long career of 
pagan Europe reached its term. 

The Jagiellons quickly established themselves as a major force. Their future 
was assured once the Teutonic Knights were routed at the Battle of Grunwald in 
1410. With one branch of the family ruling in Vilnius and the other in Cracow, 
the Jagiellons ruled the largest realm in Christendom. Though Roman 
Catholicism was the dominant cultural force, and Polish increasingly the 
language of the ruling nobility, they presided over a multinational community 
where Polish, Ruthenian, and Jewish interests were ah strongly represented. 
(Lithuanian culture receded into the peasant mass of the north-east.) Jogaila's 
son Ladislas/Wladyslaw IV (d. 1444) reigned in Hungary as well as Poland, 
dying on crusade at distant Varna. His grandson Kazimierz Jagiellonczyk (r. 
1445-92), who was married to a Habsburg, was known as the 'grandfather of 
Europe'. Indeed, when Kazimierz died in 1492, his heirs looked set to inherit the 
earth. Fate intervened in the form of the Turk. When Louis Jagiellonczyk, King 
of Bohemia and Hungary, perished heirless on the field of Mohacs in 1526, his 
possessions reverted to the Habsburgs. And it was the Habsburgs who inherited 
central Europe. Even so, the Jagiellons had given rise to a civilization that long 
outlasted their eclipse, [microbe] 


MICROBE 





Casimir Jagiellorriczyk, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, was 
buried in the Holy Cross Chapel of Wawel Cathedral in Cracow in July 
1492. In May 1973, 481 years later, the Cardinal-Archbishop of Cracow, 
Karol Wojtyla, gave permission to a team of conservationists to reopen the 
tomb, together with that of Casimir's queen, Elizabeth of Austria. The 
occasion was not unique: the tomb of Casimir the Great (d. 1370) had been 
reopened in 1869, and the reburial gave occasion for a great Polish patriotic 
demonstration. The tomb of St Jadwiga (d. 1399) had been reopened in 
1949. 

Yet the exhumation of 1973 was, in all senses, disturbing. Within a short 
period of time, no fewer than sixteen persons directly involved had died of 
uncertain causes. The world's press remembered the 'Curse of the Pharaohs' 
and speculated about 500-year-old bacilli. A Cracow journalist wrote a best¬ 
selling book on Curses, Micobes and Scholars which, in the best medieval 
fashion, reverted its readers' attention to the topic of human mortality. 1 


In late medieval Scandinavia, the three monarchies were overshadowed by the 
separate interests of a stormy nobility and by the commercial activities of the 
Hansa. The Viking communities had abandoned their sea-raiding by the 
thirteenth century, and had settled down to exploit the agriculture of the 
lowlands, the timber and iron mines, and the rich fishing grounds such as the 
famous herring-beds off Scania. The Hansa network based at Liibeck and at 
Visby linked Scandinavia both with Western Europe and with Russia. 

In 1397 the remarkable Queen Margaret (1353-1412), who reigned in 
Denmark by inheritance, in Norway by marriage, and in Sweden by election, 
succeeded in forging a limited union of the three countries. But this Union of 
Kalmar was an agglomerate, not a compound; and it was due to disintegrate into 
its national components. In the favourite saying of Queen Margaret's father, 
Waldemar IV Atterdag, 'Tomorrow is another day.' 

Medieval civilization is frequently called 'theocratic'-that is, it was governed 
by the all-pervasive concept of the Christian God. God's will was sufficient to 
explain all phenomena. The service of God was seen as the sole legitimate 
purpose of all human enterprise. The contemplation of God was the highest form 




of intellectual or creative endeavour. 

It is important to realize, therefore, that much modern knowledge about the 
Middle Ages has been coloured by the religious perspective of the churchmen 
who provided the information and wrote the chronicles. To some degree, modern 
observers may well have been misled 'into supposing that mediaeval civilisation 
was more intrinsically Christian than was probably the case'.- Even so, the 
central position of Christian belief can hardly be denied. On this point the 
growing schism between Latin and Orthodox Christianity made little difference. 
If the West was largely theocratic in outlook, the East was almost completely so. 
Indeed, the Orthodox world avoided most of the new influences which, from the 
fourteenth century onwards, made some of the broad generalizations less tenable 
(see Chapter VII). 

There is a distinction to be made, however, between the 'high culture' of the 
educated elite and the 'low culture' of ordinary people. Recent scholars have 
contrasted 'clerical culture' with the 'folklore tradition'. Since the educated 
minority was made up either of clerics or of clerics' pupils, the formal culture of 
literate circles could be expected to adhere fairly closely to conventional 
religious teaching. By the same token, since large sectors of the population were 
illiterate, including untutored women and the unlettered aristocracy, it would not 
be surprising to find pagan survivals, heretical opinions, or decidedly irreligious 
viewpoints among them. Traditional medieval scholarship was largely confined 
to the sphere of high culture. Popular culture is one of the subjects of the 'new 
Middle Ages', as presented by the latest generation of medievalists. 

Imagining the Middle Ages is, indeed, the problem. Historians have to stress 
not just what the medieval scene contained but also what it lacked. In its 
physical surroundings, it lacked many of the sights, sounds, and smells that have 
since become commonplace. There were no factory chimneys, no background 
traffic noise, no artificial pollutants or deodorants. Tiny isolated settlements 
existed in an overpowering wilderness of forest and heath, in a stillness where a 
church bell or the lowing of a cow could carry for miles, amidst a collection of 
natural but pungent whiffs from the midden and the wood fire. People's 
perception of those surroundings lacked any strong sense of discrimination 
between what later times would call the natural and the supernatural, between 
fact and fiction, between the present and the past. Men and women had few 
means of verifying the messages of their senses, so all sorts of sensations were 
given similar credence. Angels, devils, and sprites were as real as one's 


neighbours. The heroes of yesteryear, or of the Bible, were just as present (or as 
distant) as the kings and queens of one's own country. Nothing was more fitting, 
or more obvious, than Dante's story of a living man who could walk through 
heaven and hell, and who could meet the shades of people from all ages- 
undecayed, undifferentiated, undivided. 

The medieval awareness of time and space was radically different from our 
own. Time was measured by the irregular motions of day and night, of the 
seasons, of sowing and reaping. Fixed hours and calendars were in the sacred 
preserve of the Church. Men travelled so slowly that they possessed no means of 
testing conventional geographical wisdom. Jerusalem lay at the centre of the 
three continents-Asia, Africa, and Europe, allocated respectively to the sons of 
Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Beyond the continents lay the encompassing 
ocean, and beyond the ocean the line where heaven and earth merged 
imperceptibly into one. [tempus] 

Medieval interest in the human body was as minimal as the understanding of 
it. The internal organs were not clearly differentiated, let alone the 
interdependent workings of the nervous, skeletal, circulatory, digestive, and 
reproductive systems. Instead, the body was thought to be composed of a 
marvellous combination of the four elements, the four humours, and the four 
complexions. Earth, fire, air, and water were matched with black and yellow 
bile, blood and phlegm, and permed against Man's melancholic, choleric, 
sanguine, and phlegmatic temperaments. Specialist knowledge grew very slowly. 
The early fourteenth century saw doctors practising post mortem dissection, and 
a corresponding improvement in textbooks, notably in the Anatomia of Mondini 
di Luzzi (1316) and of Guido da Vigevano (1345). Surgery benefited from new 
textbooks such as the Chirurgica Magna by Guy de Chauliac (1363). After the 
experience of the Black Death, quarantine against plague ships was instituted, 
first at Ragusa (Dubrovnik) in 1377, then at Marseilles in 1383. 

Above all, it has been suggested that medieval people lived in a 
psychological environment of fear and insecurity that inhibited bold and 
independent thought. Exposure to the forces of nature, incessant warfare, 
widespread banditry, raids by Vikings, nomads, and infidels, plague, famine, and 
anarchy-all contributed to the conviction that man was feeble and God was 
great. Only in the asylum of a monastery could a forceful mind follow its own 
genius. 

Medieval philosophy, therefore, remained essentially a branch of theology. 



The central task was to accommodate Aristotelian ideas with religious dogma, 
and more generally to reconcile reason with faith. The greatest of medieval 
philosophers, the Dominican St Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225-74), achieved this by 
saying that human reason was divinely appointed, that faith was rational, and 
that, properly interpreted, the two could not be contradictory. Related problems 
were elaborated by three Franciscans, all from Britain: Roger Bacon (1214-92), 
John Duns Scotus (1265-1308), and William of Ockham (c. 1285-1349). Bacon, 
the doctor mirabilis, spent fourteen years in prison for his 'suspect novelties'. 
Duns Scotus, after whom, somewhat quaintly, the English language obtained the 
word 'Dunce', dissented from Aquinas, arguing that reason could only be 
applied to the realm of what was immediately perceptible. He was champion of 
the Immaculate Conception. Ockham, the venerabilis inceptor, excommunicated 
for his pains, was the leader of the so-called Nominalists. His demolition of the 
reigning Platonic notion of universals-abstract essences that were thought to 
exist independently of particular objects-undermined the philosophical 
foundations of many inflexible medieval conventions, including the social 
orders. 'Ockham's Razor'-the principle that facts should be interpreted with a 
minimum of explanatory causes-proved a powerful instrument for logical 
thinking. His complete separation of reason from faith opened the way for 
scientific and secular investigations. His watchword was Entia non sunt 
multiplicanda praeter necessitatem (entities should not be unnecessarily 
multiplied). When he was presented to the German Emperor, Lewis of Bavaria, 
he was supposed to have said, 'If you will defend me with the sword, Sire, I 
shall defend you with the pen.' 


TEMPUS 

Giovanni da DONDI (1318-89), Professor of Astronomy at Padua, was by 
no means the first clockmaker. Dante mentions a clock in his Paradiso; and 
there are records of clocks in London's St Paul's in 1286 and in Milan in 
1309. But Dondi's treatise // Tractus Astarii (1364) provides the earliest 
detailed description of clockwork. It presented a seven-dialled astronomical 
clock, regulated by an escapement of the crown-wheel-and-verge type. (It 
has inspired several modern replicas, one of which is displayed in the 




Science Museum, Kensington, another in the Smithsonian Institution, 
Washington.) 1 (See Appendix III, p. 1250.) 

The original invention of clockwork is usually attributed to an eighth- 
century Chinese, Liang Lin-son. But practical applications were not made in 
Europe until the end of the thirteenth century. The first clocks simply struck 
an hour bell. A machine of this type, built in 1386, still operates in Salisbury 
cathedral. Later models had dials, showing not only the hours of the day but 
also phases of the moon, the passage of the planets, even the calendar of 
saints' days and religious festivals. The finest examples were built at Milan 
(1335), Strasbourg (1354), Lund (1380), Rouen (1389), Wells (1392), and 
Prague (1462). Mechanical clocks gradually supplanted earlier types of 
timepiece such as shadow-clocks, sundials, hourglasses, and clepsydras. 
They were specially attractive for the northern countries, where sunshine 
was unreliable. They were constructed in all the great cathedrals, on city 
squares and gates, and above all in monasteries. 

The twenty-four-hour clock, with hours of a fixed duration, 
revolutionized daily habits of time-keeping. Most people had lived by the 
variable rhythms of sunrise and sunset. Where systems of hours had been 
known and used, they varied in length from season to season, and from 
country to country. Daytime Temporal hours' differed both from the 
'watches' of the night and from the 'canonical hours' of the Church, divided 
into matins, laude, prime, terce, sext, none, vespers, and compline. Ordinary 
folk took the idea of a fixed daily routine, regulated by equalized hours, 
from the medieval monks. These provided the necessary prelude to the later 
norms of urban life, and to the artificial disciplines of industrialized society. 
The clock is a 'totalitarian taskmaster' with a powerful socializing influence. 
Newtonian physics sanctified the idea that the whole universe was one great 
'celestial clock'; and it has taken the greatest of modern minds, including 
Einstein and Proust, to show how unnatural the mechanistic perception of 
time really is. 2 [combray] [e = me 2 ] 

Landmarks in the evolution of clockwork included miniaturization, 
which gave rise to domestic clocks in the fifteenth century, and to personal 
watches in the sixteenth; the pendulum (1657), which greatly increased 
reliability; the marine chronometer (1761), which solved the long-standing 
problem of measuring longitude at sea; and the keyless mechanism (1823), 
which led to popular pocket and wrist watches. The ultimate timepiece, an 



atomic clock accurate to one second in 3,000 years, was built at Britain's 
National Physical Laboratory in 1955. 

Over the centuries, clockmaking developed from a highly specialized 
craft to a mass production industry. The early centres were found at 
Nuremberg and Augsburg, and at Paris and Blois. Switzerland benefited by 
the influx of Huguenot craftsmen. In the seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries England became predominant. France led the field with case 
design and ornamental clocks. The Black Forest specialized in wooden 
'cuckoo clocks'. In the nineteenth century Swiss industry, based at Geneva 
and at La Chaux-de-Fonds in the Jura, gained worldwide supremacy in high- 
quality machine-made watches. 

The craft of clockmakers grew out of the earlier guilds of locksmiths and 
jewellers. Famous names include Jacques de la Garde of Blois, maker of the 
first watch (1551); Christian Huygens (1629-95) of the Hague, inventor both 
of the pendulum and of the spiral-balance hairspring; John Arnold, Thomas 
Earnshaw, and John Harrison (1693-1776), masters of maritime 
chronometry; Julien Leroy (1686-1759), clockmaker to Versailles; 
Abraham-Louis Breguet (1747-1823), inventor of the self-winding montre 
perpetuelle; and Edward John Dent (1790-1853), designer of Big Ben. 
Antoni Patek of Warsaw and Adrienne Philippe of Berne joined forces in 
1832 to found Patek-Philippe, the leading Swiss firm of the day. 

By that time clocks and watches were a universal feature of urbanized 
Western society. The peasants of Eastern Europe adapted more slowly. For 
millions of Soviet soldiers, the Red Army's advance into Europe in 1944-5 
provided the great chance to 'liberate' and to possess a watch. 


Medieval science, too, was inextricably bound up with theology. There was 
no clear sense of the separation of physical and spiritual phenomena, so that 
exploring the 'secrets of nature' was frequently seen as immodest prying 'into 
the womb of Mother Church'. The medieval German language, for example, 
made no distinction between 'gas' and 'spirit'. Both were Geist, the modern 
equivalent of the English 'ghost'. Scientific experiments often risked charges of 
sorcery. Alchemy long outpaced physics and chemistry, and astrology outpaced 
astronomy. The Oxford of Robert Grosseteste (c.1170-1253), Chancellor of the 
University and Bishop of Lincoln, is sometimes taken as the first home of the 




scientific tradition. 

But most of the landmark achievements came from the work of scattered 
individuals. Roger Bacon's, experiments with optics and machines formed part 
of his general attack on corruption and superstition. He was trying to verify 
knowledge, in the same way that his unfashionable insistence on Greek was an 
effort to verify the accuracy of the Latin Scriptures. Bacon's master Pierre de 
Maricourt (Peter the Stranger) produced a fundamental treatise on magnetism, 
apparently as he whiled away the time during the Angevin siege of Lucera di 
Calabria in 1269. Witello, or Vitellon (1230-80), a Silesian, wrote a fundamental 
treatise on optics, the Perspecdva, which, by dividing the mechanical operations 
of the eye from the co-ordinating function of the mind, opened the way to 
modern psychology. Nicolas Oresme (c. 1320-82), Bishop of Lisieux, produced 
an influential work on the economics of money, and another on astronomy, De 
Coelo et Mundo, which supported the theory of the rotation of the earth. He was 
an enthusiastic advocate of Reason, a man of the Enlightenment before his time, 
a denouncer of astrologers and miracle-mongers. 'Everything contained in the 
Gospels', he argued, 'is rationabilissima.' A century later, Cardinal Nicholas 
Cusanus (1401-64), from Kues on the Moselle, repeated the idea of the earth's 
rotation, predicted calendar reform, and prophesied the end of the world in 1734. 
All these men had little difficulty distinguishing the mirabilia of nature from the 
miracula of the Church. 

Given the gradual accumulation of knowledge, a need was created for 
encyclopaedic compendia. Among the most widely distributed were the 
Speculum Maius (1264) of Vincent of Beauvais and the Opus Mains (1268) of 
Roger Bacon. 

Religious belief, however, remained surrounded by every form of 
irrationality and superstition. In the later Middle Ages, Church dogma was still 
being formulated and systematized. The area of belief which people were 
ordered to accept unquestioningly was expanding. The Lateran Council of 1215 
had made confession and penance obligatory. In 1439 the doctrine of the seven 
sacraments, from baptism to extreme unction, was regularized. The doctrine of 
transsubstantiation-the contention that the bread and wine of the Eucharist are 
miraculously transformed into the blood and body of Christ-was so refined that 
the priest alone was allowed to drink the wine of the chalice. Lay communicants 
could only partake of the bread. The separation of the people from the magical, 
priestly caste was emphasized. Masses were performed on every possible 



occasion. The cult of the Virgin Mary, the divine mediator with Christ, was 
officially adopted, the recitation of the Ave Maria, 'Hail Mar', being formally 
added to the order of the Mass after the Pater Noster. Every sort of organization, 
from guilds to chivalric orders, had its patron saint. The veneration of relics was 
ubiquitous. Pilgrimages were part of everyday life for everyone, not just for the 
devout. Belief in the supernatural was reinforced by official teaching about an 
elaborate hierarchy of good and evil angels, and by the universal fear of the 
Devil. Lucifer, the fallen archangel who once sat beside Gabriel in the empyrean 
of Heaven, now stalked the world in command of the forces of darkness. The 
horrors of Hell gave preachers their favourite theme and artists a popular subject. 

The mystical tradition, which gave precedence to religious intuition over 
rational belief, had first found coherent expression in the twelfth century in the 
Augustinian monastery of St Victor in Paris. It later took deep root among the 
populace at large. Its leading exponents were headed by St Bonaventura 
(c.1217-74), sometime Master of the Franciscans and author of the influential 
Itinerarium Mentis in Deum; by 'Meister' Johann Eckhart (1260-1327) of 
Strasbourg, Vicar-General of Bohemia, who reputedly claimed that the world 
was created by his little finger; by the Fleming Jan van Ruysbroeck (1294- 
1381), 'the Ecstatic Teacher', author of De Septem Gradibus Amoris; by the 
Englishman Walter Hilton (d. 1396), author of a similar work in the vernacular, 
The Ladder of Perfection; above all by Thomas Hemerken from Kempen, near 
Cologne, known as Thomas a Kempis (c. 1380-1471), author of the Imitatio 
Christi. The anonymous Englishman who wrote The Cloud of Unknowing was 
also representative of the genre. Many of the mystics were speculative 
philosophers; but they taught Christians to cultivate the inner life, and to shun 
the evil world which they could not control. Their writings helped to fan the 
embers which eventually fired the Reformation. 

Witchcraft developed in parallel to Christian mysticism, and for some of the 
same reasons. Witches, black and white, were undoubtedly a hangover from the 
pagan animism of the pre-Christian countryside, as was the firm belief in pixies, 
elves, sprites, and hobgoblins. Yet the systematic practice of witchcraft seems to 
have been a product of the late medieval period. What is more, by openly 
entering into combat with witchcraft, the Church inadvertently fostered the 
climate of hysteria on which the alleged witches and sorcerers thrived. The 
crucial Bull Summis Desiderantes, which launched the Church's official counter¬ 
offensive, was issued by Innocent VIII as late as 1484. The standard handbook 
for witchhunters, the Malleus Maleficarum, was published in i486 by the 



Dominicans. If previously there had been reticence about witches' doings, now 
there could be none. Henceforth all Christendom knew that the legions of the 
Devil were led by evil women who anointed themselves with grease from the 
flesh of unbaptized children, who rode stark naked on flying broomsticks or on 
the backs of rams and goats, and who attended their nocturnal 'sabbaths' to work 
their spells and copulate with demons. Women were classified as weak, inferior 
beings, who could not resist temptation. Once the Church gave public credence 
to such things, the potency of witchcraft was greatly increased. Large sums of 
money could be obtained by people who undertook to ruin a neighbour's crops 
or to cause an enemy's wife to miscarry. The frontiers between fact and delusion, 
between charlatanry and hallucination, were hopelessly blurred. 

'It has lately come to our ears', declared Innocent VIII, 'that ... many people of 
both sexes have abandoned themselves to devils, incubi et succubi, and by their 
incantations, spells, conjurations and other accursed charms ... have slain infants 
in their mother's womb ... have blasted the produce of the earth, the grapes of 
the vine, the fruits of the trees ... These wretches, furthermore, blasphemously 
renounce the Faith, which is theirs by Baptism, and at the instigation of the 
Enemy of Mankind they do not shrink ... from perpetrating the ... filthiest 
excesses to the deadly peril of their souls.'- 

After that, for 300 years and more, witchcraft and witch-hunting were endemic 
to most parts of Europe, [hexen] 

Medieval ethics, as expounded by the Church, were governed by hierarchical 
notions both of the social order and of the moral code. Everyone and everything 
that was inherently inferior should be subordinated to their superiors: serfs 
should be obedient to their masters; women should be ruled by men. Venial sins 
should be distinguished from the seven mortal sins. In those countries where the 
ancient practice of 'head-money' survived, the murder or rape of a noble person 
was judged more serious, and hence more costly, than that of ignoble victims. 
Penitential tariffs emphasized that minor transgressions should not be punished 
in the same way as major ones. Despite the repressive teaching of St Augustine 
on sexual matters, sexual peccadilloes were not judged severely. 'Misdirected 
Love', as Dante put it, could not be compared to sins driven by hatred or 
betrayal. Adulterers pined in the highest circle of Hell; traitors languished in the 
Pit. Betrayal of God was the ultimate evil. Blasphemy and heresy carried the 


greatest opprobrium. The Council of Constance of 1414-17, which burned Jan 
Hus at the stake, attracted an estimated 700 prostitutes, [prostibula] 

Medieval law, too, was governed by a hierarchy of values. In theory at least, 
human laws were subject to divine law as defined by the Church; in practice, 
diversity was the norm. A welter of competing jurisdictions-canon law in the 
ecclesiastical courts, local custom in city or manor courts, royal decrees in the 
king's courts-were matched by a profusion of legal sources, practices, and 
penalties. Roman law remained the principal source in southern Europe; 
Germanic and Slavonic tribal custom were the main source in northern and 
eastern Europe. 

Customary law, however, should not be thought of as the mere survival of 
primitive practices. It was the product of a long process of detailed bargaining 
between princes and their subjects, and was often written down in elaborate 
codes. The Weistiimer, for example, proliferated throughout Austria and parts of 
western Germany. In Austria they were known as Banntaidingen, in Switzerland 
as Offnungen. Over 600 have survived from Alsace, where they were known as 
Dingofrodeln. Their existence greatly strengthened the concept of Gutherrschaft, 
as opposed to the prevailing Grundherrschaft east of the Elbe, whilst conserving 
the position of the peasant Gemeinde or communes in the countryside. They 
provide one of the basic explanations why western Germany escaped the tide of 
'neoserfdom' which was to occur in the East (see pp. 583-4). In some parts of 
eastern Europe, such as Bohemia and Silesia, the influx of German settlers led to 
the merger of German and of local legal customs. 

In the later centuries, the revival of classical studies helped Roman law to 
extend its sphere at the expense of customary law. In 1495, for example, it was 
admitted to the Reichskammergericht or Supreme Court of Justice of the German 
Empire. Its impact was to be profound. Given the growing fragmentation of 
sovereignty in the Empire, it encouraged all princes to regard themselves as the 
sole fount of legislation, and in due course to flood every aspect of life with 
regulations. The German Rechtsstaat or 'state ordered by law' would grow into a 
land which could produce the famous road sign in Baden: 'It is permitted to 
travel on this road.'- 

England alone remained exclusively attached to its common law. In England, 
as in other countries west of the Rhine, it was assumed that where the law was 
silent, the citizen was free. France, apart from the growing power of the royal 
ordonnances and of the central Parlement, continued to be divided between the 


sphere of customary law in the north and the sphere of Roman law in the Midi. 

Many countries undertook extensive codifications at an early date. In Castile, 
the Leyes de las Siete Partidas (1264-6), which formed the core of later Spanish 
law, served the same purpose as, for example, the Statutes (1364) of Casimir the 
Great and the Dygesta (1488) in Poland, or the Sudiebnik of Casimir Jagiellon in 
Lithuania. In the absence of police forces, enforcement tended to be weak. 
Fugitives from justice were ubiquitous. Punishments for those apprehended, 
therefore, tended to be ferocious and exemplary: hanging was often 
accompanied by drawing and quartering; mutilation by branding or by 
amputation was designed to be a social deterrent. Imprisonment and fines, which 
developed with statute law, led to inhuman conditions for poor prisoners, since 
little or no provision was made for their upkeep. 

Medieval education built on the foundations laid down in the twelfth and 
thirteenth centuries. Primary learning, of letters and numbers, was largely left to 
the supervision of the family or the village priest. Secondary learning was 
supported by the cathedrals and increasingly by city councils. The content, 
though less so the clintele, was still geared to the training of clergy. The three 
disciplines of the Trivium-Grammar, Rhetoric, and Logic-were the basic diet. 
Well-established foundations such as Winchester College (1382) or the Latin 
School at Deventer enjoyed a national, if not an international, reputation. Several 
of the large cities in Italy and Germany opened commercial schools. Fourteenth- 
century Florence possessed six such schools, with over 1,200 pupils. University 
foundations spread during the fifteenth century to all countries of Latin 
Christendom: such foundations included Leipzig (1409), St Andrews (1413), and 
Louvain (1425). 

Medieval literature remained predominantly devotional in character, 
although the secular tradition promoted by the chansons de geste and the byliny 
continued to develop. Most books were written in Latin or Greek. Many of them 
remained within the milieu for which they were written. The fifteenth-century 
discovery of the works of Hrotswitha of Gandersheim, for instance, a German 
nun who had written a series of Latin comedies five centuries earlier, suggests 
that a significant part of medieval literature may never have come into general 
circulation. An extensive popular literature, however, such as ballads and lives of 
the saints, was increasingly found in the vernacular, partly because formal 
education was not available for women. Popular theatre began with the miracle 



plays staged by the Church. New developments, though pregnant for the future, 
were confined to narrow circles (see Chapter VII). 

Medieval historiography remained the realm of the chroniclers and the 
annalists-men, often monks, who sought to record the past but not to explain it. 
Divine Providence was accepted as sufficient causation. The corpus of medieval 
chronicles contains several hundred major items. Some, such as the early Anglo- 
Saxon Chronicle in England or Nestor's eleventh-century Primary Chronicle 
from Kiev, were written in the vernacular. So too were the great series of French 
chronicles-Villehardouin (c.1150-1212), Joinville (c.1224-1317), Froissart 
(1337-1400), Commynes (1447-1511). Fatin or Greek, however, predominated. 
The chroniclers' bias fell heavily in favour of the Church's view on events, or 
that of the ruling prince. 'Qui Diex vielt aidier', concluded Villehardouin, 'nuls 
horn ne li puet nuire' (he whom God wishes to help, no man can harm). Political 
thought centred on the perennial problem of defining the powers of Church and 
State. Carolingian thinking had approximated to the Caesaropapism of 
Byzantium. Feudalism stressed the concept of contract. The investiture dispute 
and its derivatives produced ardent apologists both for papal supremacy or, like 
Dante's De Monarchia, for the imperial cause. Roman ideas on sovereign 
monarchy re-emerged with the study of Roman law, especially in France. But 
nothing was so revolutionary as the anti-papal treatise, Defensor Pads, of 
Marsilio of Padua (1270-1342), sometime rector of the University in Paris, who 
dared to propose that supreme authority should be wielded by a sovereign people 
controlling a secular state. 

International relations were governed by St Augustine's idea of a just war. In 
theory, war could only be just if it satisfied certain conditions. According to 
Ramon di Penafort, these were: the desire to redress injury, the exhaustion of 
alternative means, the use of professional soldiers, the good faith of the 
instigator, and the approval of the sovereign. In practice, warfare was endemic. 
Subservient clerics could always be found to confirm the justice of anyone's 
cause, private or public. Outbreaks of temporary peace punctuated the normal 
predominance of fighting. And war involved the unbridled licence of the 
soldiery. Medieval military logistics and technology did not facilitate the rapid 
settlement of disputes. Armies were tiny, the theatres of operations vast. A 
defeated enemy could easily retire and recoup. Action was directed at local 
castles and strong-points. Sieges were more common than set battles. The spoils 
of war were more desired than mere victory. In the fourteenth and fifteenth 
centuries mercenary companies, first raised by the Italian cities, were used to 



supplement the unwieldy feudal hosts. Longbows, and crossbows, greatly 
improved since their appearance in the twelfth century, increased fire-power. 
Gunpowder, first used in the fourteenth century, led to artillery, which, in the 
hands of Hussites or Turks, became a decisive arm. But armoured cavalry 
remained the backbone of any major fighting force. 

Medieval architecture was dominated by two classes of stone building- 
churches and castles. The late medieval church style, which the nineteenth 
century was to dub 'Gothic', is widely thought to be essentially aesthetic in 
inspiration-soaring, as it were, towards Heaven. As such, it is often contrasted 
with the military functionalism of the turrets, barbicans, and machicolations of 
the castles. In fact, all the main Gothic features, from the pointed arch to the 
flying buttress, are no less functional than aesthetic: they were devised for the 
purposes of efficient vaulting and of large window spaces. From the innovations 
of Abbot Suger at St Denis, the Gothic spread all over Latin Christendom. 
Gothic cathedrals were built from Seville to Dorpat, and at all points in between. 
The Orthodox world, in contrast, stayed loyal to the Romanesque-Byzantine 
tradition. East of the Catholic/Orthodox divide there are neither Gothic 
cathedrals nor private castles. New-found civic pride gave rise to magnificent 
belfries, city halls, and cloth halls. Fine examples were built at Brussels (1402), 
Arras, Ghent, Ypres (1302), and Cracow (1392). [gothic] 

Most medieval arts developed in the setting of church or cathedral. Painting 
was directed either to icons and altar-pieces or to the religious scenes of church 
murals. Book illumination was undertaken to adorn bibles and psalters. 
Sculpture in stone gloried in the statues and tableaux of cathedral fronts, and in 
the effigies of tombs and chantries. Sculpture in wood embellished choir stalls or 
choir screens. Stained glass filled the vast expanses of Gothic church windows. 
'All art was more or less applied art.'- 

Yet the secular element in medieval art, never completely absent, was 
growing. Princes, and then the rich bourgeois, began to commission their 
portraits or their statues. The art of illumination was applied to copies of the 
chansons de geste and to the fashion for books of hours, herbaries, and 
bestiaries. Late medieval dress entered a period of extravagant flamboyance 
where rich materials, fantastic styles, and brilliant colours were all designed for 
effect. Green represented love; blue, fidelity; yellow, enmity, white, innocence. 
Heraldry moved from its original military function into the realm of social 
ostentation. 


Medieval music, too, saw a fruitful blending of the sacred and the profane. 
The dominant sounds still emerged from the churches; but secular patronage was 
increasing, notably in Burgundy and the Flemish cities. The ars nova style of the 
fourteenth century enjoyed the same international influence as Gothic 
architecture. John Dunstable (c. 1390-1453), court musician to the Duke of 
Bedford in France, was innovative and influential, as was Guillaume Dufay 
(c. 1400-74). Choral polyphony developed, as did instrumental music. The 
dulcimer has been noted in 1400, the clavichord in 1404, the organ keyboard in 
1450, the sackbut or trombone in 1495. 

The 'medieval person' is an abstraction, and as such is unhistorical. 
Individuals are by definition unique, and no one person can possibly reflect all 
the main social, intellectual, and artistic trends of an age. Yet some attempt must 
be made to overcome the anonymity which surrounds many medieval 
endeavours. Individualism was not in fashion. Artists such as Jan Van Eyck 
might occasionally sign their works-JVE FECIT-but as often as not leading 
figures remained anonymous. Hence the very great value of modern works 
which seek to reconstmct the detailed lives of ordinary people, [mercante] 

No one is more medieval, however, in the utter conviction of the mission of 
Christendom, and yet more open to all the rich currents of the age, than the 
famous Catalan doctor, philosopher, linguist, poet, prodigious traveller and 
martyr, Ramon Llull (c.1235-1315). Born in Palma, Majorca, shortly after the 
Ara-gonese conquest, he knew Arabic no less than Latin; and he was raised on 
the works of the Moorish and Jewish philosophers. He laboured for many years 
at the Franciscan monastery at Miramar on Mt Randa, before setting out on his 
endless tours to persuade popes and princes to adopt the teaching of oriental 
languages. He taught at various times at Montpellier, Paris, Padua, Genoa, 
Naples, and Messina, and journeyed as far afield as Georgia and Abyssinia. At 
the Council of Vienne in 1311 he witnessed the nominal acceptance of his 
cherished proposals. He made repeated missionary expeditions to Muslim North 
Africa, where he was tragically stoned to death for his pains. His Libro del 
Gentil (1272) (Book of the Gentile and the Three Sages), first published in 
Arabic, describes an inconclusive disputation between the three religions. His 
Ars Major and Ars generalis contain a mass of speculative philosophy, which 
impressed thinkers as different as Giordano Bruno and Leibniz but which is 
largely disregarded. Llull had a vision of universal knowledge: 



MERCANTE 


In 1348 or 1349 the young Messer Francesco Datini inherited a small plot of 
land in the town of Prato, near Florence. Both his parents had died in the 
Black Death. He sold the land, and used the proceeds to set up business in 
the papal city of Avignon. There he flourished, importing silk, spices, 
weapons, and armour from Italy. In due course he was able to transfer the 
business to Florence, opening branches in Pisa, Genoa, Barcelona, Valencia, 
Majorca, and Ibiza. He was specially strong in the wool trade, buying fleeces 
direct from producers in England, Spain, and the Balearios. As he sat at his 
counter in Florence, he supervised the construction of a splendid palazzo in 
Prato, and the management of his country estate in the Apennine foothills. 
The palazzo, which still stands, was built round an arcaded courtyard and 
with a marble-panelled frontage. It was run by his wife, Monna Margharita, 
helped by his bastard daughter Ginevra, and by a large domestic staff, 
including slaves. It was enlivened by the constant flow of messengers and 
mule-trains. When Messer Francesco died heirless on 16 August 1410, of the 
gallstones, he bequeathed his estate, his papers and an enormous endowment 
of 70,000 gold florins, to the poor people of Prato. Over the door was 
inscribed: 

Ceppo di Francescho di Marco 
Mercante dei Poveri di Xto 
del quale il Chomune di Prato 
e dispensatore 

lasciato nell'anno MCCCCX. 

(Almshouse of Francesco, son of Marco | Merchant of Christ's Poor | Of 
which the Commune of Prato | is trustee | Bequeathed in the year 1410). 

Francesco's will also arranged for the manumission of his slaves, the 
cancellation of all debts, and payment of a sum for the restitution of profits 
from usury. 1 

The Datini Archive contains over 150,000 letters, 500 account ledgers, 
400 insurance policies, and 300 deeds of partnership. It shows how Messer 



Francesco, by extraordinary attention to detail, kept the pulse of a 
multinational operation. It also gave historians an unparalleled picture of a 
medieval company and household. 2 Atypical bill of exchange reads: 

In the name of God, 12th February 1399. Pay at usance 3 by this first of exchange to Giovanni 
Asapardo £306. 13s. Ad. Barcelonesi, which are for 400 florins received here from Bartolomei 
Garzoni at 15s. Ad. per florin. Pay and charge to our account there and reply. God keep you. Francesco 
and Andrea, greetings from Barcelona. Accepted March 13. Set down in Red Book B, f 97. 4 

Such transactions moved money and credit round Europe effortlessly. 
But they did not cure Messer Francesco's incurable anxiety: I dreamed last 
night of a house that had fallen to pieces ... and it gives me much to ponder 
on. For there is no news of a galley that left Venice more than two months 
ago bound for Catalonia. I had insured her for 300 florins ... But I am so 
vexed ... The more I seek, the less I find. God knows what will happen. 5 

According to Braudel, the world of the Mercante a taglio or 
Fernhandler, the rich and powerful 'long-distance merchants', has to be 
extracted from the petty dealing and intense competition of small-scale, local 
market economies. The former were the true capitalist pioneers. Thanks to 
their superior sources of intelligence and their command of large sums of 
ready cash, they could escape the laws of market competition. By 
concentrating on single transactions of great promise, this 'small group of 
large merchants' stood to make exorbitant profits: 

From the very beginning, [these men] went beyond national boundaries ... [They] knew a thousand 
ways of rigging the odds in their favour: the manipulation of credit, and the profitable game of good 
money for bad ... They grabbed up everything worth taking-land, real estate, rents. 6 

Generally speaking, the capitalists did not specialize, and they did not 
finance manufactures. They put their money promptly wherever the 
maximum opportunity lay. Money trading was the one area in which they 
did sometimes concentrate their interest. 'But its success never lasted long, 
as if the economic edifice could not pump enough nourishment up to this 
high point of the economy.' From the fourteenth century onwards, therefore, 
a cavalcade of inordinately wealthy capitalists creamed off the greatest 
profits of the European economy-the Bardi, the Medici, the Fuggers, the 
Neckers, and the Rothschilds. 

Clearly, the successes and disasters of the capitalists rested on the 



general movements of the European economy. In the fifteenth century, 'the 
"ground floor" of economic life recovered', especially in the cities. In the 
sixteenth century, when Atlantic trade expanded, 'the driving force operated 
at the level of the international fairs-Antwerp, Frankfurt, Lyons and 
Piacenza'. The seventeenth century, though often described as a period of 
stagnation, saw 'the fantastic rise of Amsterdam'. In the 'general economic 
acceleration' of the eighteenth century, when London supplanted 
Amsterdam, the uncontrolled private market outperformed the regulated 
public market. Finally, 'financial capitalism only succeeded ... after the 
period 1830-60, when the banks grabbed both industry and merchandise, 
and when the general economy could support this edifice permanently'. 7 

About that time, in 1870, Messer Francesco's ledgers were found in a 
pile of sacks under the stairs of his house in Prato. His motto was written 
inside each ledger 'In the Name of God and of Profit'. 


It took the form of what can only be described as a computing engine, which linked up the basic principles 
or 'ground-words' of all knowledge by a mechanism consisting of concentric circles segmented by radii and 
of geometric symbols. It seems to have been what might be called a cybernetic machine, prepared to 
unravel every problem, every science, even faith itself.. .- 

His Blanquerna (1283) is sometimes cited as the world's first novel, or the first 
Utopian tract. His poetry, in El Desconort or Lo Cant de Ramon, is beautifully 
simple and sincere. Llull has been called 'a great European'. 

The fifteenth century is generally taken as the century of transition between the 
medieval and the modern periods. In certain spheres the quickening pace of 
change led to a decisive break with the medieval tradition. This was true in 
learning, in the arts, and, to some degree through the rise of national monarchies, 
in politics (see Chapter VII). In most other spheres, the old order held sway. 
Huge variations, of course, continued to persist. If life in some of the late 
medieval cities was precociously developed, especially in Italy and the Low 
Countries, life in the countryside remained largely unaffected. Old and new lived 
side by side, [press] The gulf between Latin Christendom in the West and 
Orthodox Christendom in the East was steadily increasing. 

For the fifteenth century saw a momentous shift in the strategic confrontation 
between Christendom and Islam. In 1400 the European Peninsula was still 





gripped in the Muslim pincers that had stayed in place for the previous 700 
years. One arm of the pincers still held on, ever more precariously, to Granada. 
The other arm, ever more persistently was throttling Constantinople. Yet by 1500 
the pincers had slipped, and the main axis of the confrontation had moved 
dramatically. Islam, which was finally defeated in the West, was victorious in the 
East. As the Moors finally faltered, the Ottoman Turks triumphed. At the very 
time that Western Europe broke free of the Muslim blockade, Eastern Europe 
was confronted with the Muslim challenge in intensified form. In 1400 the main 
weight of the Muslim world could be felt along the whole of the traditional 
southern front. By 1500, though the green flags of the Prophet still waved along 
the African coast, they were concentrated overwhelmingly in the East. Christians 
of the Latin West could rejoice; Christians of the Orthodox East could not. 

[MATRIMONIO] 


PRESS 

The printing-press of Johann Gensfleisch zum Gutenberg, which started 
work c.1450 in the Rhineland city of Mainz, did not initiate the art of 
printing. It was the successor to an ancient line of Chinese woodblocks, 
metal engraving plates, and stone lithographs. Even so, it launched a 
revolution in information technology. Like many inventions, it created an 
original process through the combination of several existing techniques, 
including those of the Roman wine-press, the goldsmith's punch, and 
impressionable paper. Also, through the use of movable metal type cast in 
replica moulds, it saw the first application of The theory of interchangeable 
parts'-one of the basic principles of a later machine age. It possessed the 
inestimable facility for the text of a book to be set up, edited, and corrected 
before being reproduced in thousands of identical copies. 

Gutenberg is probably best remembered for his 43-line and 36-line 
Bibles. But in some ways his printing of the Catholicon or 'Book of 
Universal Knowledge' represents a more distinctive milestone. This 
encyclopedia had been compiled by the Genoese Giovanni Balbo in the 
thirteenth century. In Gutenberg's printed edition, it marked the first item of 
secular literature in mass circulation. It contains a brief preface from the 




publisher: 


With the help of the Most High, at whose will the tongues of infants become eloquent... this noble 
book has been printed and accomplished without the help of reed, stylus, or pen, but by the wondrous 
agreement, proportion, and harmony of punches and types, in the Year of the Lord's Incarnation 1460, 
in the notable city of Mainz of the renowned German nation. 1 

Within the period of incunabula before 1500, when printing was in its 
swaddling clothes, the main roman, italic, and gothic type-styles emerged; 
and the presses spread quickly to Basle (1466), Rome (1467), Pilzno in 
Bohemia (1468), Paris (1470), Buda (1473), Cracow (1474), Westminster 
(1476), and Cetinje in Montenegro (1493). Printing reached Moscow in 
1555. 

The power of the printed word inevitably aroused the fears of the 
religious authorities. Hence Mainz, the cradle of the press, also became the 
cradle of censorship. In 1485, the local Archbishop-Elector asked the city 
council of nearby Frankfurt-am-Main to examine the books to be exhibited 
at the Lenten Fair, and to help in the suppression of dangerous publications. 
As a result, in the following year, Europe's earliest censorship office was set 
up jointly by the electorate of Mainz and the city of Frankfurt. The first edict 
issued by the Frankfurt censor against printed books banned vernacular 
translations of the Bible. 2 [index] 

In contrast to Christendom, the Islamic world exercised a total ban on 
printing until the nineteenth century. The consequences, both for Islam and 
for the spread of knowledge in general, can hardly be exaggerated. 3 


The strategic shift was signalled by two landmark events: the fall of 
Constantinople to the Turks in 1453 and the fall of Granada to the Spaniards in 
1492. The consequences were immense. The shift gave rise in the religious 
sphere to the last vain attempt to reunite the two divided halves of Christendom; 
in the economic sphere to the search for new trade routes. In the realm of 
geopolitics, it ensured that the emergent kingdom of Spain was bathed in 
Catholic triumphal-ism, whilst the emergent principality of Moscow was 
immersed in the resentments of the Orthodox defeat. The liberated West, led by 
Spain, was preparing for the conquest of new worlds. The embattled Orthodox 
East, led by Moscow, dug in behind its mental stockade. Each in its own way 




was preparing a further round in the medieval quest for a Christian empire. 

Given the Ottoman encirclement of Constantinople (see p. 386), Christian 
leaders were driven to reconsider the healing of the Schism between the Greek 
and Latin Churches. The result was the ill-starred Union of Florence of 1439, 
one of the most pathetic episodes in the scandalous annals of Christian disunity. 
The Greeks had been petitioning the Papacy for decades, and a Venetian Pope, 
Eugene IV (1431-47), finally recognized the emergency. Indeed, being pressured 
beyond endurance by the reforming Council of Basle, he saw that mending 
relations with the Orthodox might strengthen his own position. The negotiations 
which opened in Ferrara in January 1438 and continued in Florence were led by 
the Pope; by the Byzantine Emperor John VIII Palaeologos (r. 1425-48) and his 
Patriarch; and by twenty-two bishops, who had deserted their colleagues in Basle 
to attend. Not surprisingly, the desperate Greeks gave way on all matters of 
substance, readily accepting the Roman doctrines of papal supremacy, purgatory, 
the Eucharist, and the Filioque. The way was cleared for reinstating the unity of 
the Church on papal terms. In the decree Laetantur coeli of 6 July 1439, the 
union was formally sealed. The text of the union was read from the pulpit of 
Santa Croce in Latin by Cardinal Julian and in Greek by Archbishop Bessarion 
of Nicaea; and the two churchmen symbolically embraced. 

Unfortunately, none of the parties to the Union actually possessed the means 
for putting it into effect. The Pope was bitterly denounced by the rump of the 
Council of Basle, which moved swiftly to elect the last of the antipopes, Felix V 
(1439-49). The German bishops stayed aloof. The French bishops, elated by the 
recent enactment of the antipapal Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges, leaned towards 
the Council. The attempt to end the Schism with Constantinople had provoked 
yet another schism within the Roman Church itself. The Orthodox Church was 
no more enthusiastic. In Constantinople, the clergy who had signed the Union 
were repudiated. 'We need no Latins,' the mob shouted. 'God and the Madonna 
who have saved us from Persians and Arabs will save us now from Muhammad.' 
In Alexandria, a synod convened by the eastern Patriarchs condemned the Union 
outright. In Moscow, the Metropolitan Isidore returned from Florence wearing a 
Latin cross and was promptly imprisoned. His bishops rebelled against the 
'treason of the Greeks', and proceeded to elect a new Metropolitan without 
reference to the Patriarch of Constantinople. This was the start of separate 
Russian Orthodox tradition. 



MATRIMONIO 


Sigismund de zorzi and his wife, patricians of fifteenth-century Ragusa, 
had twelve children-six boys and six girls. In the order of their birth, 
c. 1427-49, the children were Johannes, Franciscus, Vecchia, Junius, 
Margarita, Maria, Marinus, Antonius, Helisabeth, Aloisius, Artulina, and 
Clara. 

Three boys and one of the girls did not marry. Even so, finding suitable 
marriage partners for the other eight must have kept their parents busy over 
at least two decades. Margarita (No. 5) was the first to be betrothed in 1453, 
closely followed by Maria (No. 6, 1455) and the eldest daughter, Vecchia 
(1455). The eldest son, Johannes, did not marry until 1459, when he must 
have been at least 32 years of age. He was followed the next year by his 
sister, Helizabeth (No. 9), who was about 16 years his junior. Franciscus 
(No. 2) waited until 1465, when he was about 36, whilst 1471 saw the 
betrothals both of Artulina (No. 11), aged about 24, and Junius (No. 4), aged 
about 38. 

The pattern of marriages in this one family was not unusual. They match 
not only those of other patrician families in Ragusa but also studies from 
Renaissance Italy. It conforms to what historical demographers have called 
the Mediterranean Marriage Pattern (MMP), characterized by high levels of 
celibacy and by a gross discrepancy in the age at marriage of sons and 
daughters. 1 

Ragusa was a city-republic living from Adriatic shipping and the 
overland Balkan trade. 2 (It gave its name to the English word 'argosy'.) Its 
population of c.20,000 was dominated by a score of closely intermarried 
patrician clans who held all the municipal offices. Marriage in medieval 
Ragusa was a serious business. Detailed pacta matrimonialia were drawn up 
between the bride's father and the prospective son-in-law. Dowries were 
fixed on average at 2,600 hyperi (866 gold ducats). The standard penalty for 
not proceeding within the agreed period from betrothal to wedding and 
consummation was 1,000 gold ducats. The average age at betrothal, usually 
two to three years before marriage, was 18 for girls, 33.2 for men. As the de 
Zorzi example shows, brothers usually had to wait until their sisters had 



been provided for. 

The underlying factors of Ragusa's 'marriage culture' were economic, 
biological, mathematical, and customary. Men held back from matrimony 
until they could support a family and could expect a share of their father's 
legacy to augment the wife's dowry. Many waited so long that they never 
married at all. Women entered matrimony much earlier, but not just to 
maximize their child-bearing capacity. They had to compete for the pool of 
reluctant grooms. Families preferred their sons-in-law, who would normally 
become business partners, to be mature, and to take early responsibility for 
their daughters' 'honour'. 

The ramifications of marriage strategy in history are so complex that 
macro-theorizing on the subject has proved less satisfactory than empirical 
local studies. The theory which divided the whole of Europe into two simple 
zones of a late-marrying 'European [sic] Marriage Pattern' and an early- 
marrying 'East European Marriage Pattern' 3 carries much less conviction 
than the micro-analysis of matrimony in medieval Florence 4 or Renaissance 
Ragusa. [zadruga] 

Ragusa retained its independence until 1805, when it was occupied by 
the French. After a century of Habsburg rule, it was joined in 1918, as 
Dubrovnik, to Yugoslavia, and to the Republic of Croatia in 1992. The 
medieval city in which the de Zorzi lived was twice devastated-by the 
earthquake of 1667 and by the Serbian naval bombardments of 1991-2. 
Among the many Renaissance buildings in the Stari Grad which took a 
direct hit was the Sponza Palace, home of the city archives and of the 
marriage registers. 5 


The Ottomans pressed on. At Varna on the Black Sea coast, in 1444, the 
Ottoman Sultan Murad II destroyed the last of the crusades which papal money 
could send against him. In 1448 he crushed the last of the Hungarian expeditions 
across the Danube. Only in Albania, under Skanderbeg, did resistance to the 
Sultan flourish. Feeble, friendless, but still defiant, Constantinople awaited its 
destiny, [vlad] 

The final siege of Constantinople began on 2 April 1453, Easter Monday, 
and lasted for eight weeks. The twenty-year-old Sultan, Mehmet II (r. 1451-81), 




handsome and secretive, was eager to attack, having been frustrated as a boy, 
when his plan for a campaign against the Walls had been rejected. The bachelor 
Emperor, Constantine XI Palaeologos (r. 1448-53), still optimistically searching 
for a bride, awaited him without illusions. Preparations had been thorough. The 
cities of Thrace and the Black Sea coast were ravaged to prevent assistance. A 
fleet of triremes and transport barges was assembled at Gallipoli. A castle was 
built at the narrowest point of the Bosporus at Rumeli Hisar. A 26-ft (7.9-m) 
bronze cannon, hurling stone shot of 12 hundredweight (609 kilos) each, had 
been specially cast by the Sultan's Hungarian engineer, and was pulled from 
Adrianople by 60 oxen. Inside the city, weapons were collected and money 
raised to pay the troops. Outside the walls, the ditches were deepened and the 
moat by the Blachernae Gate flooded. Embassies were duly sent to Venice, to the 
Vatican, to France and Aragon. A company of 700 men arrived under Giovanni 
Giustiniani Longo, a Genoese captain who was given command of the land 
walls. On the day that the first Turkish detachments came into view, a procession 
of migrating storks flew over the Straits. The city gates were closed. A great iron 
chain was stretched across the entrance to the Golden Horn. Only 7,000 
defenders stood to arms against the onslaught of 80,000. 


VLAD 

Vlad III, Prince of Wallachia (1431-76), otherwise known as 'Dracula' 
and 'Vlad the Impaler', quickly passed into legend as a byword for cruelty. 
In recent times, the sexual overtones of his perversion have attracted much 
notoriety. Yet he was an historical figure, whose birthplace at Sighi§oara, and 
castles at Poenari and Bran, can be visited in present-day Romania. His 
principality of Wallachia lay on the left bank of the lower Danube, squeezed 
between the great Kingdom of Hungary, which regarded him as its vassal, 
and the growing empire of the Ottoman Turks, to whom he paid tribute. 
During the Crusade of Varna in 1443-4, when he was an adolescent boy, he 
was sent as a hostage to the court of the Ottoman Sultan, Murad II; and the 
buggery to which he was subjected can be considered the likely psychiatric 
source of his later obsessions. 

The use of the pala or 'pointed stake' was well known to the Turks as a 




form of punishment. But in the hands of Vlad III it became an instrument of 
veritable mass terror. In the more refined variant, a needle-thin stake, 
specially sharpened and greased, was rammed in the victim's rectum and out 
through the mouth in such a way that the death throes could last for days. 
Vlad III came to power in 1456, only three years after the Turkish Conquest 
of Constantinople, and saw himself as champion of the Christian princes 
confronting the Infidel. One expedition across the Danube reputedly brought 
him 23,883 prisoners for impaling, not counting those mercifully beheaded 
or burned alive. At home, his reign began with the mass killing of the 
Wallachian nobility, perhaps twenty thousand men, women, and children 
impaled on a forest of stakes beneath the castle window. 1 

Dracula's arrest and imprisonment by Matthias Corvinus, King of 
Hungary, led in 1463 to the publication in Vienna of a German account of 
his misdeeds, Geschichte Dracole Wayde, which was the basis for all 
subsequent literature. A Russian version produced in 1488 was certainly 
known to Ivan the Terrible, who seems to have made use of it. Its pages 
serve to remind us of the strange connection between religious fanaticism 
and pathological cruelty which persisted in both East and West. The annals 
of the Spanish Inquisition, or of the Marian persecution in England as related 
in John Foxe's Book of Martyrs (1563), belong to the same sickening genre 
as the horrors of the Wallachian vampire-prince. 2 [ludi] [tormenta] 


The progress of the siege at first gave encouragement to the defenders, 
though the impaling of Christian prisoners in view of the Walls was calculated to 
cause panic. On 12 April a naval attack on the boom failed. The great cannon, 
firing once every seven minutes from sunrise to sunset, day after day, reduced 
large sections of the outer wall to rubble. But the gaps were filled at night with 
wooden stockades. On 20 April an imperial transport flotilla fought its way into 
the harbour. Turkish mining operations were betrayed. 

But then, in a masterstroke, the Sultan ordered his fleet of galleys to be 
dragged overland behind Pera and into the Golden Horn. The City lost its 
harbour. From then on, the defenders had only three options: victory, death, or 
conversion to Islam. On 27 April an ecumenical mass was celebrated in St 
Sophia, for Greeks and Italians, Orthodox and Catholics. 'At this moment, there 
was Union in the Church of Constantinople.'- 





The decisive assault was launched about half-past one in the morning of 
Tuesday, 29 May, the fifty-third day of the siege. First came the bashi-bazouk 
irregulars, then the Anatolians, then the Janissaries: 

The Janissaries advanced at the double, not rushing in wildly... but keeping their ranks in perfect order, 
unbroken by the missiles of the enemy. The martial music that urged them on was so loud that the sound 
could be heard between the roar of the guns from right across the Bosphorus. Mehmet himself led them as 
far as the fosse, and stood there shouting encouragement... Wave after wave of these fresh, magnificent and 
stoutly armoured men mshed up to the stockade, to tear at the barrels of earth that surmounted it, to hack at 
the beams that supported it, to place their ladders against it... each wave making way without panic for its 
successor.- 


Just before sunrise, Giustiniani took a culverin shot on his breastplate and 
retired, covered in blood. A giant janissary called Hasan was slain after 
mounting the stockade; but he showed it was possible. A small sally-port, the 
Kerkoporte, was left open by retreating Greeks, and the Turks swarmed in. The 
Emperor dismounted from his white Arabian mare, plunged into the fray, and 
disappeared. 

Constantinople was sacked. Gross slaughter and rapine ensued. St Sophia 
was turned into a mosque: 

The muezzin ascended the most lofty turret, and proclaimed the ezan or public invitation ... The imam 
preached; and Mohammed the Second performed the namaz of thanksgiving on the great altar, where the 
Christian mysteries had so lately been celebrated before the last of the Caesars. From St Sophia, he 
proceeded to the august but desolate mansion of a hundred successors of the great Constantine... A 
melancholy reflection on the vicissitudes of human greatness forced itself on his mind, and he repeated an 
elegant distich of Persian poetry. 'The spider has woven his web in the Imperial Palace, and the owl hath 
sung her watch-song on the towers of Afrasiab'.- 

The Roman Empire had ceased to exist. 

In the course of their conquest of the eastern Mediterranean, the Ottoman 
Turks gradually set the terms of trade in the region, controlling the routes which 
linked Europe with the Levant and India. In practice the Turks were tolerant to 
Christian traders, and the reluctance of Venice and Genoa to assist 
Constantinople can only be explained by the lucrative trade which they already 
operated in the Ottoman realms. But contemporaries further afield may have 
judged the situation differently; and the rise of the Ottomans is traditionally 
associated with the attempts by Christian leaders in the West, led by Portugal, to 
discover a new route to India. It may well be, of course, that the Portuguese were 
as unwelcome to the Venetians as to the Turks, or were pulled by the lure of 
African slaves and beautiful islands. 


At all events, for forty years Prince Henry of Portugal (1394-1460), known 
as 'the Navigator', sent expedition after expedition down the western coast of 
Africa in the wake of earlier Arab voyagers. His ships found Porto Santo (1419), 
Madeira (1420), the Canaries (1421), later ceded to Castile, the Azores (1431), 
Cabo Blanco (1441), and Cape Verde (1446). The fate of the Canaries, where the 
native Guanche population was annihilated under Spanish rule, gave a foretaste 
of the instincts of later European colonization. In 1437 the Colonial and Naval 
Institute at Sagres was founded, the first of its kind. By 1471 the Portuguese 
were strong enough to wrest Tangier from the Moors. In 1486, sailing from 
Portuguese settlements on the Gold Coast, Bartholomew Diaz rounded the Cabo 
Tormentoso, subsequently renamed the Cape of Good Hope. In 1497 Vasco da 
Gama completed an unbroken voyage from Lisbon to Calicut, thereby 
circumventing the Ottoman sphere, [goncalvez] 

In neighbouring Spain, that same era was crowned by a famous political 
union. The two rival kingdoms of Castile and Aragon had long tempered their 
rivalry with dynastic alliances and marriages. The marriage of Juan I of 
Trastamara, King of Castile (r. 1379-90), to Eleanora of Aragan produced the 
protoplasts of both the Castilian and the Aragonese houses of the following 
century. One son, Henry III (r. 1390-1406), reigned in Castile, whilst the second 
son, Ferdinand I, was unexpectedly chosen in 1412 for the throne of Aragon in 
Barcelona. The marriage between Henry Ill's granddaughter Isabella, Princess of 
Castile (1451-1504), 'La Catolica', and Ferdinand I's grandson, Ferdinand, 
Prince of Aragon (1452-1516), 'El Catolico', which was concluded in 1469 at 
Valladolid, was not without precedent; but its future implications were immense. 

Both bride and groom were heirs to the desperately troubled families, and to 
viciously disputed kingdoms. They were cousins, and knew well what to expect 
if their relatives or their nobles were allowed to gain control. Isabella, upright 
and devout, had been touted for marriage in Portugal, England, and France 
throughout her childhood, and had only been saved from the altar by the death of 
an unwanted suitor on his way to the wedding. Her claim to Castile only arose 
through the unlawful exclusion of her niece; and her accession in 1474 sparked 
off both a civil and an international war with France and Portugal. Ferdinand, 
devious and devout, sought her hand as a means of escape from his own 
miserable circumstances. His childhood was passed amidst the horrors of a 
protracted Catalan revolt. His claim to Aragon only arose through the exclusion 
of his bastard cousin, Ferrante of Naples, and the poisoning of his half-brother, 
Charles of Viana, Prince of Navarre. Isabella's brother, Henry IV (r. 1454-74), 



has been described as 'a miserable, abnormal cipher'. Ferdinand's father, John II 
(r. 1458-79), was the hated poisoner of a son and a daughter. It is not surprising, 
therefore, that Ferdinand and Isabella, 'the Catholic monarchs', were advocates 
of strong and orderly government. 


GONCALVEZ 

In 1441 Antam Goncalvez sailed his tiny ship out of Lisbon, edged 
southwards along the Atlantic coast of Morocco, passed the Canary Islands, 
and rounded Cape Bojador. Since the prevailing winds blow northerly off 
that part of the African coast, it was only seven years earlier that a similar 
Portuguese ship had succeeded in passing the fearful Cape and in returning 
safely to Europe. 

Goncalvez had set out to collect a cargo of blubber and sea-lion skins. 
But landing on the shore of the Rio de Oro, he was seized by the idea of 
taking a few of the local inhabitants as a prize for his master, Prince Henry. 
So the next evening a party of ten sailors marched inland. Returning empty- 
handed across the sand dunes at dawn, they spied a naked Berber walking 
behind a camel and carrying two spears. The man defended himself with 
spirit, but was soon wounded, overpowered, and captured. Together with a 
luckless black woman, probably a local slave girl, who also appeared on the 
scene, he was tied up and carried off. They were the first recorded victims of 
a European slave-raid south of the Sahara. 1 

Soon afterwards Goncalvez joined up with another ship commanded by 
Nuno Tristao. Their combined crews mounted a night attack on a native 
encampment. With wild cries of 'Portugal' and 'Santiago' they fell on the 
sleeping villagers, killing three and taking ten prisoner. In all, they returned 
to Lisbon with twelve captives. Their exploits were recorded by the 
chronicler Zurara, and Prince Henry sent an embassy to Rome to seek the 
Pope's blessing for this new sort of crusade. The Pope granted 'complete 
forgiveness of sins ... to all engaged in the said war'. 2 

Slave-raiding and slave-trading were an immemorial feature of African 
life, but this was the moment when Europeans broke into operations that had 




hitherto been handled by African and Muslim traders. It happened some fifty 
years before Europe's first contacts with the Americas, and it put European 
entrepreneurs into a good position for exploiting the new opportunities. In 
1501 Spain issued a decree to limit the export of Christian girls to garrison 
brothels across the Atlantic. In 1515 Spain sent the first consignment of 
black slaves directly from Africa to America, whilst receiving the first 
shipment of slave-grown American sugar. 

More than a century after Goncalvez, a fresh stage of the Atlantic slave 
trade was reached, when English sea captains broke into the Spanish and 
Portuguese monopoly. In October 1562 John Hawkins sailed from Plymouth 
for the coast of Guinea with three ships-the Salomon, the Swallow, and the 
Jonas. Variously described as a pirate and an admiral, Hawkins established 
the 'Great Circuit', with its threefold profits of English goods sold in Africa, 
African slaves sold in the Indies, and American products sold in England. 
On that first voyage he took a short cut by relieving a Portuguese slave ship 
of its human cargo at sea. On his second voyage, in 1564, he received 
financial backing from the Queen of England herself, who rewarded him 
with a knighthood and with a coat of arms bearing 'a demi-Moor, chained'. 
On a third voyage, in 1567, he obtained 470 slaves as booty after lending his 
crewmen as mercenaries to the kings of Sierra Leone and of Castros, who 
were fighting a war against their enemies, Zacina and Zatecama. 3 [uskok] 

In this way, European traders entered a lasting and lucrative partnership 
with their African suppliers. 'The Root of the Evil', writes one historian, lay 
in 'a demand for slaves on one side, and on the other a monopolist interest 
among African chiefs in obtaining European consumer goods, especially 
firearms.' 4 Before the trade was stopped in the nineteenth century, some 15 
million Africans had been seized for slavery in the Western hemisphere. Of 
those, perhaps 11 or 12 million were actually landed alive. 5 


For the time being, the union of Castile and Aragon remained a personal one. 
The two kingdoms retained their separate laws and governments. Isabella had 
little choice but to attack the nobility of Castile; Ferdinand had no choice but to 
work with the Cortes of Aragon. Even when he asked for a window to be closed 
in the debating chamber, he was wont to add: 'if the fueros permit'. The sense of 
common purpose was achieved partly by the introduction of a common currency 




and the removal of commercial barriers and partly by the enforcement of ultra- 
Catholic ideology. In 1476 Isabella set up a sinister but efficient law- 
enforcement agency, initially aimed at the noble brigands of Castile-the Santa 
Hermandad or Holy Brotherhood. In 1483, both Castile and Aragon were 
required to play host to the first institution of united Spain, a reorganized royal 
version of the Holy Inquisition under its president, the Queen's confessor, the 
Dominican Thomas Torquemada (1420-98). Henceforth, treason and heresy 
were virtually indistinguishable. Non-conformers, Jews, and dissidents were 
rigorously persecuted. The further existence of the emirate of Granada could not 
be tolerated, [deviatio] 

The final conquest of Granada began in 1481 and lasted for ten years. In 
wealth and population Granada was as superior among the provinces of Spain as 
Constantinople among the cities of the East. Seventy walled towns, supplied by 
the most fertile countryside, might have hoped to resist indefinitely. But the 
dissensions of the Moorish rulers gave entry to the united Spanish forces. When 
Granada itself was besieged, a wooden city called Santa Fe or 'Holy Faith' was 
built to house the besiegers. The capitulation came on 2 January 1492. In the 
eyes of Christian enthusiasts, Constantinople was avenged. 


DEVIATIO 

No medieval institution has attracted greater opprobrium from later ages 
than the Holy Inquisition. To many modern commentators, the ferocity 
aroused during the pursuit of heretics, Jews, or witches [hexen] is often 
incomprehensible. The inquisitors were simply deranged. Yet a little 
reflection suggests that the phenomenon is not exclusively medieval. The 
definition of 'normal' and 'deviant' is always subjective. People whose 
unconventional conduct threatens entrenched interests can easily be 
denounced as 'mad' or 'dangerous'. Comparisons have been made between 
the Inquisition and the contemporary medical establishment's opposition to 
the Mental Health Movement. 1 They can also be made with the treatment of 
dissidents to the Soviet regime, who in the 1980s were still regularly 
consigned to psychiatric clinics, diagnosed as 'schizophrenic', and forcibly 
disabled with drugs. 2 




The conquest of Granada was accompanied by an appalling breach of good 
faith. Promises of religious toleration were not kept. When Queen Isabella 
hesitated, the Grand Inquisitor, Torquemada, is said to have held out a cross with 
the words: 'Judas sold his master for thirty pieces of silver. How many will you 
take for this cross?' The Jews were then faced with a decree enforcing 
conversion or banishment. - Perhaps 20,000 Sephardic families chose exile- 
many, ironically, in Smyrna and Istanbul, whence the Sultan sent ships to collect 
them.- The class of conversos, many still secretly loyal to Judaism, was greatly 
enlarged. By a decree of 1502 the Muslims were given the same choice. Many 
migrated to North Africa; the remainder were left to form a second group of 
dubious converts, the moriscos. Only in Aragon did the Cortes prevent the King 
from compelling the Muslim serfs, the mudejares, to change religion. In a 
climate of religious hatred and suspicion, the Inquisitors could barely cope. The 
fires of the autos-da-fe, the 'acts of faith', burned all over Spain. Spaniards 
became obsessed with the limpieza de sangre, the 'purity of blood'. 

By coincidence, the fall of Granada in 1492 was witnessed by a Genoese 
sailor who had come to the camp at Santa Fe to seek the Catholic monarchs' 
patronage. Cristoforo Colombo (c.1446-1506), known as Cristobal Colon, had 
long been seeking their support for his scheme to sail across the Atlantic Ocean 
in search of Asia. There, after the fall of Granada, he struck the deal. On 3 
August, as 'Admiral of the Ocean', he set sail from the port of Palos in three tiny 
ships-the Santa Maria, the Pinta, and the Nina. Ten weeks later, at two in the 
morning on 12 (21) October, a crewman sighted land. Columbus landed at 
daybreak, kissed the ground, named it San Salvador, and laid claim to it for 
Castile and Leon. He returned to Palos, via the Azores and Lisbon, on 15 March 
1493, convinced that he had discovered a route to the (East) 'Indies'.- 

That same year, after vigorous petitioning by Spain and Portugal, Pope 
Alexander VI agreed to set a boundary between their respective spheres of 
overseas interest. All land discovered to the west of a line lying 100 leagues 
beyond the Azores was to belong to Spain; everything to the east was to be 
Portugal's. The world was neatly divided in two on the sole authority of a pope. 
In 1494, by the Treaty of Tordesillas, the line was moved 250 leagues further 
west. The event was nicely medieval. Yet it could hardly have taken place, still 
less been exploited, if the Iberian kingdoms had not been freed from their 




preoccupations with Islam. After all, Ferdinand and Isabella had stubbornly 

refused to negotiate with Columbus until the fall of Granada was accomplished, 
[STATE] 

Three thousand miles to the east, at the other extremity of Christendom, the shift 
of the Christian-Moslem frontier was having equally unsettling effects. By 1452, 
almost the whole of the Orthodox Christian world was subject to foreign rule. 
The Orthodox of the Greek Rite, with the exception of the tiny Byzantine 
Empire and its dependencies, had fallen under Ottoman rule. The Orthodox of 
the Slavonic Rite, with minor exceptions, had all fallen under Tartar, Polish- 
Lithuanian, or Hungarian rule. So, when Constantinople surrendered, it looked 
as if the Orthodox of Europe were set to endure the same unending captivity that 
the Orthodox of Asia and Africa had endured since the seventh century. In one 
place alone, in the city of Moscow, there were thoughts of a different destiny. 

Moscow in the mid-fifteenth century, though nominally subject to the Tartar 
khan, enjoyed a wide measure of autonomy. It was ruled by the Grand Prince 
Vassily II (r. 1425-62), who, having lost his sight, relied heavily on his son and 
heir. Ivan III (r. 1462-1505), therefore, was already an experienced politician 
when he mounted the throne. The once powerful Tartar Horde was greatly 
weakened, and Moscow had avoided payment of the annual tribute since 1452. 
As a result, Ivan had hopes of escaping The Tartar yoke' for good. In this, it was 
obvious that he should stress his role as the champion of the Orthodox Christians 
against the Muslims of the south and the Catholics of Poland-Lithuania to the 
west. If only he could gain recognition of his sovereignty, he would then become 
the one and only independent and Orthodox prince on earth. 

Oddly enough, Ivan's ambition was greatly assisted by the schemes of the 
Roman Pope. After the disaster of 1453 the Papacy had accepted the wardship of 
Zoe Palaeologos (b. 1445), niece of the last Byzantine Emperor. Zoe, daughter of 
Thomas, Despot of Morea, had been born in Greece, but had been well educated 
by tutors in Rome. In 1469 she was a bright young woman of 24, eager to escape 
her guardians. Pope Paul II, a Venetian, thought that he could revive the union of 
Florence and forge a Muscovite alliance against the Turks. So, when he heard 
that Ivan III was recently widowed, he produced the ideal candidate. Papal 
emissaries appeared in Moscow, and the match was made. Zoe travelled after 
them via the Baltic port of Reval. She was readmitted to the Orthodox faith, and 
married to Ivan on 12 November 1472. The prestige which attended Ivan's 
marriage to a Byzantine princess is hard to exaggerate. Up to then, Moscow had 



been the most peripheral province of the most downtrodden branch of 
Christendom. Its princes were barely on the map. But now they were touching 
the mantle of the Caesars. They were only one step removed from adopting the 
imperial mantle for themselves. 


STATE 

In 1493, the year in which Columbus returned to the Kingdom of Castile, 
the map of Europe from Portugal to the Khanate of Astrakhan contained at 
least thirty sovereign states. Five hundred years later, if one discounts 
Andorra and Monaco, the Union of Kalmar and the Swiss Federation, whose 
independence had been little more than de facto, no single one of those thirty 
states had maintained its separate sovereign existence. Of the sovereign 
states on the map of Europe in 1993, four had been formed in the sixteenth 
century, four in the seventeenth, two in the eighteenth, seven in the 
nineteenth, and no fewer than thirty-six in the twentieth. The rise and fall of 
states represents one of the most important phenomena of modern Europe 
(see Appendix III, p. 1268). 

State-formation in Europe has been analysed in many ways. The 
traditional approach was based on constitutional and international law. The 
aim was to describe the legal framework within which empires, monarchies, 
and republics organize their government, control their dependencies, and 
gain recognition. More recently, greater emphasis has fallen on long-term 
considerations-on statistical calculations of the longevity of states, 1 for 
example. Norbert Elias viewed state-formation as part of a civilizational 
process operating since the period of feudal fragmentation through the 
steady accretion of princely power. 2 

Others have looked more at the interplay of internal structures and 
external relations. In one view, three types of state have prevailed- tribute¬ 
raising empires, systems of fragmented sovereignty, and national states. 
Their internal life-force has been dominated either by the concentration of 
capital, as in Venice or the United Provinces, or by the concentration of 
coercion, as in Russia, or by varying concentrations of the two-as in 




Britain, France, or Prussia. Money and violence were the prime movers. The 
performance of states in the international arena depended on their 
participation in the elaborate multilateral power combinations that have 
constantly coalesced and recoalesced during more than 100 major wars in 
Europe since the Renaissance. The key questions were: 'How did states 
make war?' and 'How did wars make states?' 3 Many of the issues resemble 
those examined in a more empirical fashion by Paul Kennedy. 4 

The supposedly ultimate destination, the nation-state, has been achieved 
many times. But the paths leading to that destination have been extremely 
varied. In the last resort, everything turned on power. 'Qui a la force', wrote 
Richelieu, 'a souvent la raison en matiere d'Etat.' 5 In short, 'might is right'. 
Which only makes one wonder whether the nation-state should really be the 
ultimate destination. 


In 1477-8 Ivan moved against Novgorod the Great, whose five provinces far 
exceeded the territory of Moscow. Novgorod had recently conceded the secular 
overlordship of Lithuania and the ecclesiastical authority of the Metropolitan of 
Kiev. Ivan saw this as a personal affront, and his army soon forced the poorly 
defended city to capitulate and to switch allegiance. A second visitation was 
made to suppress sedition, and was followed by mass executions and 
deportations. Pskov and Vyatka received the same treatment. In the summer of 
1480 Ahmad, Khan of the Golden Horde, launched the third of his expeditions to 
enforce payment of Moscow's tribute. He had counted on the aid of Poland- 
Lithuania, but it did not materialize. When Ivan held firm, and Ahmad retired 
empty handed, Moscow's dependence on the Horde was taken to have finally 
lapsed. Moscow was free. By that time Ivan had started to refer to himself as 
'Tsar' and 'Samodyerzhets'-Russian equivalents of Caesar and Autokrator. 
Like Charlemagne almost 700 years before, a semi-barbarian prince was 
building his image not as the founder of a modern state, but rather as the 
reincarnator of the old, dead, and barely lamented empire of the Romans. 

The Feast of Epiphany, 6 January 1493, the Kremlin, Moscow. The 

celebration of the holy day was proceeding amidst the splendours of the Grand 
Duke's private chapel in the Blagoveshchensky Sobor, the Cathedral of the 
Annunciation. It was the twelfth day of Christmas, the final stage of the season 




of the Nativity, a remembrance of the time when Christ made himself manifest to 
the Three Kings. Sonorous voices intoned the Byzantine Rite in words of Old 
Church Slavonic, which echoed round every corner of the cathedral's domes and 
frescoed walls. The icon screen, which cut off the inner sanctuary, was far older 
than the church. It was covered by rows of icons painted by Moscow's greatest 
medieval artists- Theophanes the Greek, Andrei Rublev, Prokhor of Gorodets. 
Black-robed and bearded priests moved round the chancel, performing the 
preliminary ceremonies of vesting, censing, and veiling of the gifts. 

This being Epiphany, the alternate liturgy of St Basil the Great took the place 
of the more usual liturgy of St John Chrysostom.- In its Slavonic version, it was 
essentially the same as that which was used by the Orthodox of the Balkans. 
Though familiar, it was no more intelligible to the Russian congregation standing 
patiently before the screen than Latin was to Italians or Spaniards. The public 
service, the Synaxis or Assembly, began as the celebrants entered the nave, and a 
deacon recited the Litany of Peace: Tor peace from on high, and for the 
salvation of our souls, let us pray to the Lord. Lor the peace of the whole world 
...' There followed hymns, ferial anthems, psalms, the Beatitudes, lessons from 
the Apostles and from the Gospel, prayers, further litanies, and the Cherubic 
Hymn of the Thrice-Holy. The Gospel reading, introduced by the usual Preface, 
was taken from the first verses of Matthew 2:

(Now when Jesus was bom in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the 
Tsar, behold there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying: Where is 
he that is born Tsar of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are 
come to worship him... )- 

The second part of the service, the Anaphora or offering of the gifts, began 
with the Great Entrance, when priests and deacons processed round the nave 
with prayers, censers, and candles. There followed the recital of the Creed, the 
preparation of the bread and the wine, the Lord's Prayer, and the Communion. 
During Communion, the choir sang 'Receive ye the body of Christ, Taste ye of 
the fountain of immortal life'. The priest, in the Orthodox tradition, mentioned 
every communicant by name. 'The servant of God, Ivan, partaketh of the holy 
precious body and blood of... Our Saviour Jesus Christ, unto remission of his 
sins and unto everlasting life.' After the thanksgiving, the priest distributed the 
blessed bread, held up the Cross for the people to kiss, then re-entered the 
chancel before the gates were shut behind him. The closing words of the 
Dismissal-'Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace'-were 
accompanied by hymns ending with the Contakion of the Sixth Tone: 

Unshakeable foundation of the Church hast Thou shewn 
Thyself, 

Unto all mankind bequeathing an assured mastery 
Sealed by Thy ordinances, 

Basil by heaven proven most holy, 

Both now, and for ever and world without end. Amen. 



Far away, unbeknown to the people of Moscow, the Admiral of the Ocean was 
battling at that very time against midwinter gales on the final stage of his return 
voyage to Spain. He would land at Palos within the week. 

That year, the Christmas celebrations in Moscow were coloured by very 
special emotions. Learned monks had been predicting for some time that no one 
would live to see the year completed. According to Orthodox calculations, 
August 1492-the month when Columbus had set sail on his outward voyage- 
marked the end of the seventh millennium since the Creation; and it had been 
widely foretold to be the End of the World. Indeed, no steps had been taken to 
calculate the Church calendar for the following years. Although the Orthodox 
used the same Julian calendar that was current in the Latin Church, they had a 
different system for counting the anni mundi, the years of creation. Also, as in 
Byzantium, it was their custom to start the ecclesiastical year on 1 September. 
So, given their belief that the 'seven days' of creation were a metaphor for seven 
millennia, and their dating of the Creation to 5509 bc, ad 1492 was reckoned 
equivalent to 7000 am, and the likeliest date for Judgement Day. 31 August was 
the critical date. Failing that, the crack of doom might be delayed until 31 
December, the last day of the secular year-and the midpoint of the season of 
Nativity. When Epiphany was reached without incident, Moscow breathed a sigh 
of relief.- 

Moscow, in fact, stood on the brink of a new career. Its Grand Duke, Ivan III, 
had not been counting on the Day of Judgement. He was nearing completion of 
grandiose plans to remodel the Kreml or 'fortified city' of his capital. By 
symbolic and ideological means, he was preparing to launch the powerful 
Russian myth which was to be a fitting partner for Moscow's growing political 
might. 

Most of the cities of Rus' had their kremlins. But the Kremlin of Moscow, as 
redesigned by Ivan III, outshone anything that existed elsewhere. In January 
1493 the vast enclosure of its red-brick walls and tall round towers had been 
completed only a few months earlier. It covered an irregular triangle round a 
perimeter of 2.5 km, enough to envelop half the City of London. At its heart was 
the airy expanse of an open square, round which were ranged four cathedrals and 
the grand ducal residence. The Cathedral of the Annunciation was in pristine 
state, having received its finishing touches only three years earlier. Its neighbour, 
the Uspensky Sobor, the Cathedral of the Dormition, the seat of the 



Metropolitan, was now thirteen years old. It had been built by the Bolognese 
architect Aristotle Firavanti, whose brief was to adapt the ancient Vladimir style 
to modern uses. It became a standard for Muscovite church architecture. Its 
interior provided a large open space, without galleries, under matching domed 
and vaulted compartments. Its frescos were still being painted in the inimitable 
bright colours and elongated figures of Dionysius the Greek. On the other side 
the Church of the Razpolozhenie, 'of the Deposition of the Robe', was seven 
years old. The Archangelsky Sobor, with its Renaissance facade, was still on the 
drawing board. The Granovitaya Palata or 'Palace of the Facets' by Marco 
Rulto and Pietro Solano-so called from the diamond-cut stones of its facade- 
had just been occupied by Ivan's household. They moved in after several years 
sharing the house of his favourite minister. It replaced the former wooden hall 
which had served Ivan's predecessors for centuries. Few capitals in Christendom 
short of Rome or Constantinople could compare with such splendour. 

Within the Palace of Facets, Ivan's household was riven by the rivalry of two 
powerful women-Zoe Palaeologos, his second wife, and Elena Stepanovna, his 
daughter-in-law. Zoe, the niece of the last Byzantine Emperor, had married Ivan 
after the death of his first wife, Maria of Tver. Her preoccupation was to protect 
the interests of her seven children, headed by the thirteen-year-old Vasily. Elena 
was the daughter of Stephen IV, Hospodar of Moldavia, and widow of Ivan's 
first heir and successor, Ivan the Younger, who had recently died. Her concern 
was to preserve the interests of her nine-year-old son, Dmitri. In 1493 Ivan III 
had not yet decided whether he should name his son Vasily or his grandson 
Dmitri to succeed him: he was to favour each by turns. The tension beneath the 
surface in the Kremlin must have been electric.-

Ivan III is popularly remembered in Russia as the Tsar who threw off the 
Tartar yoke. He might be better considered as an exponent of Tartar financial, 
military, and political methods, who used the shifting alliances of khans and 
princes to replace the Tartar yoke with a Muscovite one. In his struggle with the 
Golden Horde, whose hegemony he definitively rejected after 1480, his closest 
ally was the Khan of the Crimea, who helped him to attack the autonomy of his 
fellow Christian principalities to a degree that the Tartars had never attempted. 
From the Muscovite point of view, which later enjoyed a monopoly, 'Ivan the 
Great' was the restorer of 'Russian' hegemony. From the viewpoint of the 
Novgorodians or the Pskovians he was the Antichrist, the destroyer of Russia's 
best traditions. When he came to write his will, he described himself, as his 
father had done, as 'the much-sinning slave of God'.- 

Ivan III had first called himself Tsar or 'Caesar' twenty years before. He did 
so in a treaty with the republic of Pskov, presumably to laud his superiority over 
other local princes; and he repeated the exercise on several occasions in the 
1480s. But Tsar, though a cut above Grand Duke, was not the equivalent of the 
Byzantine title of Basileus. It could not be construed as a full imperial dignity 
unless accompanied by all the other trappings of Empire. Caesar, after all, was 
the term that had been used to designate the co-emperors and deputy emperors of 
the supreme Augustus. 

In 1489 Ivan III had considered another proposition. In his dealings with the 
Habsburgs, he was told that a royal crown could be procured for him from the 
Pope. His standing in the West would certainly have been enhanced by regal 
status. But the title of rex or koro had connotations that offended Muscovite 
pride, [kral] To accept would be to repeat the alleged treason to the True Faith 
which the Greeks had committed at Florence. So Ivan refused. 'My ancestors', 
he explained, 'were friendly with the Emperors who had once given Rome to the 
Pope.'- What he did do, though, was to borrow the Habsburgs' imperial 
emblem. As from the 1490s, the double-headed eagle began to appear as the 
symbol of state in Moscow as in Vienna, as indeed in Constantinople, [aquila] 

Apart from its fears about the end of the world, the Muscovite Church was 
enduring a period of great uncertainty. It had broken with the Patriarch of 
Constantinople (see pp. 446-7) without yet finding a fully independent role. 
Unlike the Metropolitan of Kiev, who was a resident of Lithuania, the Moscow 
Metropolitan was elected by his bishops, and headed an ecclesiastical 
organization which admitted no superior. For forty years it had been impossible 


to reconcile this state of affairs with the absence of an emperor, and hence with 
the Byzantine tradition that Church and State were indivisible. Just as there 
could be no emperor without the true faith, there could be no true faith without 
an Emperor. Some had pinned their hopes on the reconquest of Constantinople 
for an Orthodox Christian emperor-the so-called 'Great Idea'. Others hoped 
that some arrangement might be reached with the German Emperor of the 
Latins. But that was rejected. The one remaining alternative was for Moscow to 
do what both Serbia and Bulgaria had done in the past-to find an Emperor of 
their own. 

The immediate problem, however, was to draw up a new paschal canon, with 
its calculations of the Easters for the eighth millennium. This is the task to which 
Metropolitan Zosimus had been putting his mind in the autumn of 1492. 'We 
await the Advent of our Lord,' he wrote in the Preface, 'but the hour of his 
coming cannot be established.' He then appended a brief historical summary. 
Constantine had founded the New Rome, and St Vladimir had baptized Rus'. 
Now Ivan III was to be 'the new Emperor Constantine of the new 
Constantinople-Moscow' .- This was the first indirect mention of the pedigree 
with which Moscow would now be clothed. 

Also in 1492, and also for the first time, the 'new Constantinople-Moscow' 
may have been given its more familiar label of 'the Third Rome'. In that year 
Archbishop Gennadius of Novgorod supposedly received a translation of the 
Roman Legend of the White Klobuck, and with it a preface explaining how a 
manuscript of the legend had been found in Rome. Scholars disagree about the 
age of this text, parts of which may have been interpolated at a later date. But it 
is not irrelevant that the Preface contains a clear reference to Moscow as the 
'Third Rome'. The author of the Preface is sometimes equated with a known 
translator who was working on the Apocalypse of Ezra. This work was part of 
Archbishop Gennadius' project to endow the Muscovite Church with a complete 
version of the Bible equivalent to the Latin Vulgate.- 

Once the Russian principalities were brought to heel, Moscow's imperial 
ambitions would obviously be directed against the Grand Duchy of Lithuania- 
Muscovy's western neighbour. Lithuania had benefited from the Mongol 
invasions, using its base on the northern periphery to expand its annexations 
among the fragments of the former Rus', just as Moscow had done. By the end 
of the fifteenth century Lithuania, like Muscovy, controlled a huge swathe of 
territory- essentially the Dnieper basin-which stretched from the shore of the 


Baltic to the confines of the Black Sea. 

Unlike Muscovy, however, Lithuania was open to Western influences. For 
more than a century the Grand Duchy had flourished under the personal union 
with Poland (see pp. 429-30). By the 1490s the Lithuanian court at Wilno and 
the Catholic ruling elite were to a large extent polonized in language and 
political culture. The Lithuanian dynasty was in possession not only of Poland 
and Lithuania but of Bohemia and Hungary as well. Unlike Muscovy, Lithuania 
permitted a wide measure of religious diversity. The Roman Catholic 
establishment did not impede either the numerical predominance of Orthodox 
Christianity or the steady influx of a strong Jewish element. Unlike Muscovy, the 
Orthodox Church in Lithuania had not broken with Constantinople nor with its 
ancient Byzantine loyalties. The Metropolitan of Kiev had every reason to resist 
Moscow's separatist line, which was dividing Slavic Orthodoxy and moving 
inexorably towards the formation of a breakaway Russian Orthodox Church. 

In January 1493 Moscow's relations with Lithuania were about to take a new 
turn. Six months earlier Casimir Jagiellonczyk, King of Poland and Grand Duke 
of Lithuania, had died, dividing his realm between his second and third sons. 
The Polish kingdom passed to Jan Olbracht, Lithuania to the unmarried 
Alexander. (The eldest son was already King of Bohemia and Hungary.) Ivan III 
had seen the possibilities. On the one hand, he was preparing an embassy which 
would travel to Wilno, and would launch negotiations leading to a political 
marriage between Grand Duke Alexander and Ivan's daughter Elena. At the 
same time, he was setting conditions which would undermine the previous 
modus vivendi of the two states. For the first time in Moscow's history, he armed 
his ambassador with instructions demanding recognition of the hitherto unknown 
title of gosudar' vseya Rust -'lord of all-Rus".- It was a classic diplomatic 
double hold-one part apparently friendly, the other potentially hostile. Ivan was 
deliberately pulling Lithuania into an engagement that called into question the 
future of all the eastern Slavs. 

To make his point, Ivan staged a sensational demonstration. Some time 
before Christmas he had arrested two Lithuanians employed in the Moscow 
Kremlin. He charged them with plotting to poison him. The accusations against 
Jan Lukhomski and Maciej the Pole did not sound very credible; but their guilt 
or innocence was hardly relevant. They were held in an open cage on the frozen 
Moskva River for all the world to see; and on the eve of the departure of Ivan's 
envoy to Lithuania, they were burned alive in their cage.- As the ice melted 


under the fierce heat of the fire and the heavy iron cage sank beneath the water, 
taking its carbonized occupants down in a great hiss of steam, one could have 
well imagined that something was being said about Lithuania's political future. 

The title 'Lord of All-Rus" did not possess much basis either in history or in 
current reality. It came into the same category as that whereby the kings of 
England laid claim to France. In the 1490s, two-and-a-half centuries after all 
traces of a united Kievan Rus' had been destroyed, it had the same degree of 
credibility that the king of France might have enjoyed if, in his struggle with the 
German Empire, he had proclaimed himself 'Lord of all the Franks'. By that 
time, it conflicted with the separate identity that the 'Ruthenes' of Lithuania had 
assumed from the 'Russians' of Moscow. Indeed, it all seemed sufficiently 
unreal for the Lithuanians to accept it as a small price to pay for Ivan's good 
humour. They were not to know it, but they were conceding the ideological 
cornerstone of territorial ambitions that would be pursued for 500 years. 

By 1493, therefore, all the main elements of the ideology of the 'Third 
Rome' were in existence. There was an autonomous branch of the Orthodox 
Church looking for an emperor; there was a prince, related to the last Byzantine 
Emperor, who had already called himself Tsar; and there was a claim to the 
lordship of all-Rus'. All that was lacking was a suitably ingenious ideologue, 
who could weld these elements into the sort of mystical theory that was 
demanded by an intensely theocratic state. Such a man was at hand. 

Philotheus of Pskov (c. 1450-1525) was a learned monk of Pskov's Eleazar 
monastery. He was familiar with the biblical prophecies of Ezra and Daniel, with 
historical precedents from Serbia and the second Bulgarian Empire, with the 
Pseudo-Methodius and the Chronicle of Manasses, and with the Legend of the 
White Klobuck. Such knowledge was not unique. Philotheus was unusual only 
in his willingness to use these things for the benefit of the Muscovite princes. 
Pskov, like Novgorod, lived in fear and trembling of Moscow. Most of its monks 
were fiercely anti-Muscovite. When they made references in their Chronicle to 
Nebuchadnezzar's Dream, or to the four beasts of Daniel's Vision, they were apt 
to do so in a manner that identified Nebuchadnezzar with Moscow. For whatever 
reason, Philotheus was prepared to turn the material round to Moscow's 
advantage. In 1493, in his early forties, he held no office of authority in the 
monastery where he would later rule as hegumen or abbot; and he had not yet 
written any of the public Epistles which were to make him famous. But the 
ferment in the Church which was to shape his views, was already in progress. In 



due course he was to be the advocate of the total submission of all Christians to 
the Tsar, and of total opposition to the Latin Church. In his Epistle to Ivan's 
successor, he enjoins the new Tsar to rule justly, because the world was now 
entering the terminal phase of history: 

And now I say unto Thee, take care and take heed, pious Tsar: all the empires of Christendom are united in 
thine. For two Romes have fallen, and the Third exists; and there will not be a fourth. Thy Christian Empire, 
according to the great theologian, will not pass away. And, for the Church, the word of the blessed David 
will be fulfilled: 'she is my place of eternal rest'...- 

Later, in his Epistle to Munexin, Philotheus would fulminate 'Against the 
Astrologers and the Latins': 

And now, alone, the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church of the East shines more brightly than the sun in 
the universe; and only the great Orthodox Tsar of Rome, like Noah saved from the flood in the ark, directs 

the Church ...- 


Here, twenty years after Ivan Ill's death, but clearly inspired by his policies, was 
the definitive formulation of an ideology of Church and State that left no inch for 
compromise. 

Later Russian tradition was to hold that Moscow had simply inherited the 
Byzantine mantie. In reality, whilst Byzantine forms were retained, the essence 
of the Byzantine ethos was lost. Muscovite ideologues had little interest in the 
universal and ecumenical ideals of East Roman Christianity. The most 
distinguished historian of these matters has described the ideology of'Third 
Rome' as 'a meretricious substitute'. 'The Christian universalism of Byzantium 
was being transformed and distorted within the more narrow framework of 
Muscovite nationalism.'- 

Muscovite theology was disturbed in Ivan Ill's later years by a couple of 
related controversies that would both be settled in favour of the most 
uncompromising elements. One controversy centred on the views of a sect or 
tendency known as the zhidovstvuyushchie or 'Judaizers'. The other centred on 
the supposed scandal of Christian monasteries growing rich through the 
possession of land. Joseph, Abbot of Volokhamsk, was the organizer both of the 
'anti-Judaizers' and of 'the possessors'. 

Landed property was inseparable from the power of the Muscovite Church. 
But it was opposed by a company of puritanical monks led by the 'Elders 
beyond the Volga' who cherished Orthodox monasticism's older, eremitical 


tradition. Ivan III seems to have prepared a scheme for secularizing monastic 
wealth, but was persuaded to desist. Matters only came to a head after his death, 
when his former favourite Patrikeev, now turned monk, published a new edition 
of the Nomocanon the Orthodox manual of canon law. One of Patrikeev's 
associates, Maxim the Greek, who offered a 'non-possessorial' interpretation of 
the Church's landed property, was lucky to escape with his life. 

The Judaizers provoked still greater passions. They had emerged in the 
1470s in Novgorod, where they were said to have formed an anti-Muscovite 
faction. Their views were allegedly inspired by Jews from Poland and Lithuania, 
and their members were said to be clandestine adherents of Judaism. Their 
activities do not seem to have worried the Tsar, who appointed a suspect 
Novgorodian to be archpriest of the Uspensky Cathedral; and they may have 
enjoyed the support of Elena Stepanovna. Despite a Council convened in 1490 to 
examine charges of anti-trinitarianism and iconoclasm, they continued to 
circulate in the highest circles. But Abbot Joseph did not give up. In 1497, in his 
ProsvetiteV or 'Enlightener', he named none other than Metropolitan Zosima as 
the chief 'Judaizer and Sodomizer', 'a foul evil wolf'.- Abbot Joseph and his 
partner, Archbishop Gennadius, were both admirers of the Spanish Inquisition, 
and their zeal was eventually rewarded by a grand auto-da-fe. They had 
succeeded in persuading their compatriots to believe what would prove a 
recurrent theme in Russian history-that evil came from the West. In their day, 
the West meant in the first instance Novgorod, and beyond Novgorod, Poland- 
Lithuania. 

Ivan Ill's diplomacy was taking the same direction.- Diplomacy in those 
days moved extremely slowly. Muscovite embassies took anything between six 
months and four years to return and report from foreign countries; and 
ambassadors often found on arrival that the situation no longer matched their 
instructions. Even so, it was clear by the 1490s that the encirclement of 
Lithuania was becoming Moscow's top priority. Ivan's father had kept the peace 
with Lithuania for decades; and on his death Ivan and his mother had been 
entrusted to the care of 'my Brother, the King of Poland and Grand Duke of 
Lithuania, Casimir'.- All this was being revised. 

By 1493, Ivan III was coming to the end of twenty years of intensive 
diplomatic activity. The common thread was to check and to encircle the 
Jagiellons. His treaty with Stephen IV, Hospodar of Moldavia, sealed by the 
marriage of his son, had tried in vain to prevent Moldavia paying homage to the 


Polish king. His scheme for an anti-Jagiellonian pact with Hungary was mined 
by the sudden death of Matthias Corvinus, and by the subsequent election of 
Wladyslaw Jagiellon as King of Hungary. He even made contact with the 
independent dukes of Mazovia. As from 1486, Ivan III repeatedly exchanged 
embassies with the Habsburgs, who until then had wrongly thought that 
Muscovy was a fief of Lithuania. In 1491 an Austrian envoy, Jorg von Thurn, 
outlined plans for a grand anti-Jagiellonian coalition made up of the Empire, the 
Teutonic Knights, Moldavia, and the Tartars. In January 1493 Ivan's envoy, Yuri 
Trakhaniot, tracked Maximilian down to Colmar only to find that the Emperor 
had already made his peace with the Jagiellons and was now more interested in a 
Crusade. Ivan Ill's relations with the Crimea included an important anti- 
Lithuanian component. His main use for them was as allies against the Golden 
Horde; and in June 1491 he sent three armies to help disperse the camp which 
the Golden Horde had established at the mouth of the Dnieper. At the same time, 
he could not fail to notice that the Tartars, when sweetened by Moscow, spent 
most of their energies raiding Poland and Lithuania. 

In the winter of 1492-3 Muscovy was engaged in a desultory frontier war 
with Lithuania. Several of the border princelings had changed sides. The Prince 
of Ryazan' was preparing to challenge a punitive incursion mounted by the 
Lithuanian Voivode of Smolensk. The Muscovite army, which had orders to 
capture the city of Vyazma on the headwaters of the Dnieper, moved off within a 
few days of the Muscovite peace mission to Wilno. Whether peace or war was 
uppermost in Ivan's mind was anyone's guess. 

In this age of discovery, therefore, Moscow, though remote, was not totally 
isolated. Each of the Muscovite embassies returned with foreign engineers, 
architects, and gunners in tow; and German and Polish merchants came every 
year to buy large stocks of furs. It is true that there was no direct contact with 
Tudor England, with Valois France, or with the Spain of Ferdinand and Isabella. 
The Baltic trade with the Netherlands stopped in Livonia, and the route round 
the North Cape had not yet been opened. Even so, Moscow had well-established 
lines of communication with the rest of Europe. In the north, the 'German Road' 
led through Novgorod to Reval or to Riga, and thence by sea to Liibeck. 
Overland, the forest trails stretched westwards to the frontier before Smolensk, 
and thence to Wilno and Warsaw. Ivan III had inaugurated a system of posts and 
post-horses, whose upkeep he commended in his will.- To the south, the ancient 
rivers carried travellers rapidly to the Caspian or the Black Sea, and thence by 
ship to all points of the Mediterranean. Despite the Ottoman advance, Moscow 


was still in close touch with the old Byzantine world-that is, with the Balkans, 
with Greece, especially Athos, and via Greece with Italy. 

Moscow, in any case, was making discoveries of its own. In 1466-72 a 
merchant of Tver, Afanasii Nikitin (d. 1472), made a six-year journey to Persia 
and India. He travelled out via Baku and Hormuz, and returned via Trebizond 
and Caifa. His adventures were written down in an early travel book, Khozenie 
za tri moria (A Journey Beyond the Three Seas). Ten years later the military 
expedition of Saltyk and Kurbskii crossed the Urals and reached the headwaters 
of the Irtysk and the Ob (a feat equivalent in scale to that of Lewis and Clark in 
America 300 years later). In 1491 two Hungarian prospectors had penetrated the 
Arctic tributaries of the Pechora, where silver and copper had been discovered. 
This discovery probably explains the arrival in Moscow in January 1493 of an 
Austrian prospector called Snups, who carried letters from the Emperor 
Maximilian asking him to be allowed to explore the Ob. Since Ivan's link with 
the Habsburgs was no longer convenient, Snups was refused. 

As for the Admiral of the Ocean, news of his exploits were brought to 
Moscow with a quarter of a century's delay in the company of Maxim the Greek. 
Maxim Grek (Michael Trivolis, c. 1470-1560) belonged to the dying Byzantine 
world whose parts still formed one cultural region. He was born at Arta in Epirus 
under Ottoman rule, whence his family moved to Venetian Corfu. In 1493 he 
was in Florence, studying with the Platonists and listening with approval to 
Savonarola's sermons. After further studies at Venice and at Mirandola, where 
he specialized in the exegesis of Greek texts, he took the vows of the Dominican 
order in Savonarola's own monastery of San Marco. Later, as the monk 
Maximos, he worked for a decade as a translator in the Vatopedi monastery on 
Mount Athos, in a pan-Orthodox and graeco-Slav environment, where the 
schism between the Orthodox and Catholic traditions did not apply. He was then 
invited to Moscow to organize the Tsar's collection of Greek and Byzantine 
manuscripts, which Muscovite scholars were no longer trained to decipher. He 
soon fell foul of the hard-line faction of the Muscovite Church, which accused 
him of sorcery, espionage, and respect for the Patriarch of Constantinople. Yet he 
survived his lengthy imprisonment, met Ivan IV in person, and enjoyed his 
patronage. He was 'one of the last of his kind'.- 

Maxim's writings, which appeared in the 1550s, make mention of'a large 
island called Cuba'.- There is no doubt that by then he had a firm knowledge of 
Columbus's landings in the Caribbean. But the chronology of his career is 


important. Since Maxim spent three decades incarcerated in a Muscovite gaol, it 
is reasonable to suppose that he brought the information with him when he first 
travelled to Moscow in 1518, twenty-five years after Columbus's first voyage. 

It is one of the wonderful coincidences of history that modern 'Russia' and 
modern 'America' both took flight in the same year of ad 1493. Europeans 
learned of the 'New World', as they saw it, at the self-same moment that 
Muscovites learned that their 'Old World' was not yet coming to an end. 

* The arrangement stayed intact until 1623, when the Palatinate was replaced 
by Bavaria. In 1648 the Palatinate was reinstated alongside Bavaria, and in 1708 
Hanover was raised to the ninth Electorate. Napoleon's extensive amendments 
were never put into practice. 


VII 


RENATIO 

Renaissances and Reformations, c.1450-1670 


There is a strong sense of unreality about the Renaissance. The mode of 
thinking which is supposed to distinguish modern European civilization both 
from medieval Christendom and from other non-European civilizations such as 
Islam had no clear beginning and no end. For a very long time it remained the 
preserve of a small intellectual elite, and had to compete with rival trends of 
thought, old and new. In the so-called 'Age of the Renaissance and Reformation' 
which conventionally begins c.1450, it can only be described as a minority 
interest. There were large sectors of European society, and huge areas of 
European territory, where as yet it wielded no influence whatsoever. It somehow 
contrived to be the most remarkable feature of the age and yet to be divorced 
from the main aspects of everyday political, social, and cultural life. It was 
untypical and unrepresentative, yet immensely significant. Like the wonderful 
figures of Sandro Botticelli, which are among its most powerful manifestations, 
whether the exquisite Primavera (1478) or the ethereal Venus Rising from the 
Waves (c.1485), its feet somehow did not touch the ground. It floated over the 
surface of the world from which it arose, a disembodied abstraction, a new 
energizing spirit. 

Faced with the problem, many historians of the period have abandoned their 
earlier concerns. It is no longer the fashion to write so much about those 
minority interests. Humanist thought, reformation theology, scientific discovery, 







and overseas exploration have had to give way to studies of material conditions, 
of the medieval continuities, and of popular belief (and unbelief) as opposed to 
high culture. The professionals now like to spotlight magic, vagrancy, disease, or 
the decimation of colonial populations. This may be a very proper corrective; but 
it is as odd to forget Leonardo or Luther as it once was to ignore a Nostradamus 
or the Miller of Friuli. No one who wishes to know why Europe was so different 
in the mid-seventeenth century from what it had been in the fifteenth can afford 
to bypass the traditional subjects. 

Even so, the incautious reader needs to be reminded. The world of 
Renaissance and Reformation was also the world of divination, astrology, 
miracles, conjuration, witchcraft, necromancy, folk cures, ghosts, omens, and 
fairies. Magic continued to compete, and to interact with religion and science. 
Indeed, the dominion of magic among the common people held sway through a 
long period of cohabitation with the new ideas over two centuries or more.- One 
implication is that this 'Early Modern Period' may not be quite so modern after 
all. Despite the fresh seeds that were sown, it could well have had more in 
common with the medievalism that preceded it than with the Enlightenment 
which followed. 





Europe, 1519 

The Renaissance, therefore, cannot be easily defined. It is easiest to say what it 
was not. Tver since the Renaissance invented itself some six hundred years 
ago,' complained one American historian, 'there has been no agreement as to 
what it is.'- The Renaissance, for example, did not merely refer to the 
burgeoning interest in classical art and learning, for such a revival had been 
gathering pace ever since the twelfth century. Nor did it involve either a total 
rejection of medieval values or a sudden return to the world-view of Greece and 
Rome. Least of all did it involve the conscious abandonment of Christian belief. 
The term renatio or 'rebirth' was a Latin caique for a Greek theological term, 
palingenesis, used in the sense of'spiritual rebirth' or 'resurrection from the 
dead'. The essence of the Renaissance lay not in any sudden rediscovery of 












classical civilization but rather in the use which was made of classical models to 
test the authority underlying conventional taste and wisdom. It is 
incomprehensible without reference to the depths of disrepute into which the 
medieval Church, the previous fount of all authority, had fallen. In this the 
Renaissance was part and parcel of the same movement which resulted in 
religious reforms. In the longer term, it was the first stage in the evolution which 
led via the Reformation and the Scientific Revolution to the Enlightenment. It 
was the spiritual force which cracked the mould of medieval civilization, setting 
in motion the long process of disintegration which gradually gave birth to 
'modern Europe', [balletto] 

In that process, the Christian religion was not abandoned. But the power of 
the Church was gradually corralled within the religious sphere: the influence of 
religion increasingly limited to the realm of private conscience. As a result the 
speculations of theologians, scientists, and philosophers, the work of artists and 
writers, and the policies of princes were freed from the control of a Church with 
monopoly powers and 'totalitarian' pretensions. The prime quality of the 
Renaissance has been defined as 'independence of mind'. Its ideal was a person 
who, by mastering all branches of art and thought, need depend on no outside 
authority for the formation of knowledge, tastes, and beliefs. Such a person was 
l'uomo universale, the 'complete man'.- 

The principal product of the new thinking lay in a growing conviction that 
humanity was capable of mastering the world in which it lived. The great 
Renaissance figures were filled with self-confidence. They felt that God-given 
ingenuity could, and should, be used to unravel the secrets of God's universe; 
and that, by extension, man's fate on earth could be controlled and improved. 
Here was the decisive break with the mentality of the Middle Ages, whose 
religiosity and mysticism were reinforced by exactly the opposite conviction- 
that men and women were the helpless pawns of Providence, overwhelmed by 
the incomprehensible workings of their environment and of their own nature. 
Medieval attitudes were dominated by a paralysing anxiety about human 
inadequacy, ignorance, impotence-in short, by the concept of universal sin. 
Renaissance attitudes, in contrast, were bred by a sense of liberation and 
refreshment, deriving from the growing awareness of human potential. 
Speculation, initiative, experiment, and exploration could surely be rewarded 
with success. Intellectual historians examine the Renaissance in terms of new 
ideas and new forms; psychologists would look more to the conquests of fears 
and inhibitions which had prevented the new ideas from flourishing for so long 


(see Appendix III, p. 1269). 


BALLETTO 

Dance, having played a central role in pagan religious rites, was largely 
ignored during the Middle Ages, except for rustic entertainment. It is 
generally agreed that the secular dance spectacle performed by Bergonzio di 
Botta at the Duke of Milan's wedding, at Tortona in 1489, is the earliest 
example of the modern genre on record. From Italy, the baletto was exported 
in the time of Catherine de' Medici to the French court, where, under Louis 
XIV, it became a major art form. Lully's Triomphe de I'Amour (1681) fixed 
the long-lasting genre of opera-ballet. 

The modern theory and practice of ballet were largely developed in mid- 
eighteenth-century Paris, especially by the royal ballet master Jean Georges 
Noverre (1727-1810). Leading dancers such as Marie Camargo or Gaetano 
Vestris, who modestly called himself le dieu de la danse, based their training 
and performances on the grammar of the five classical positions. At a later 
stage, the combination of classical technique with Romantic music, such as 
the Coppelia (1870) of Leo Delibes or the Roy Douglas fantasia on Chopin 
tunes, LesSylphides (1909), proved immensely attractive. 

Russia first imported French and Italian ballet under Peter the Great, but 
in the nineteenth century moved rapidly from imitation to creative 
excellence. Tchaikovsky's music for Swan Lake (1876), Sleeping Beauty 
(1890), and The Nutcracker (1892) laid the foundations for Russia's 
supremacy. In the last years of peace, the Ballets Russes launched by Sergei 
Diaghilev (1872-1929) enjoyed a series of unsurpassed triumphs. The 
choreography of Fokine, the dancing of Nizinski and Karsavina, and, above 
all, the scores of Stravinsky, brought ballet to its zenith with The Firebird 
(1910), Petrushka (1911), and The Rite of Spring (1913). After the 
Revolutions of 1917, the Ballets Russes stayed abroad, whilst the Soviet 
Bolshoi and Kirov Ballets combined stunning technical mastery with rigid 
artistic conservatism. 




Modem dance, as opposed to ballet, is older than might be supposed. Its 
basic principles, of translating musical rhythm into corresponding bodily 
movements, were put forward by the music teacher Francois Delsarte (1811- 
71). Delsarte inspired the two principal practitioners of the art, the Swiss 
Jacques Dalcroze (1865-1950), the pioneer of rhythmic gymnastics, and the 
Hungarian Rodolf Laban (1879-1958). After modern dance in central 
Europe felHoul of the Nazis, the centre of gravity moved to North 


No simple chronological framework can be imposed on the Renaissance. 
Literary historians look for its origins in the fourteenth-century songs and 
sonnets of Petrarch, who observed human emotions for their own sake (see 
Chapter VI). Art historians look back to the painters Giotto and Masaccio 
(1401-28), to the architect Filippo Brunelleschi (1379-1446), who measured the 
dome of the Pantheon in Rome in order to build a still more daring dome for the 
cathedral in Florence, or to the sculptors Ghiberti (1378-1455) and Donatello 
(c. 1386-1466). Political historians look back to Niccolo Machiavelli (1469- 
1527), who first explained the mechanics of politics as power for power's sake. 
Every one of these pioneers was a Florentine. As the first home of the 

Renaissance, Florence can fairly lay claim to be 'the mother of modern Europe', 
[FLAGELLATIO] 

In those unmatched generations of versatile Florentines, no one ever 
outshone Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519). The painter of perhaps the most 
celebrated picture in the world, La Gioconda (1506), he possessed seemingly 
limitless talents to pursue his equally limitless curiosity. His notebooks contain 
everything from anatomical drawings to designs for a helicopter, a submarine, a 
machine-gun. (Such mechanical inventions had been the rage in Germany at an 
even earlier period.'-) His fame is surrounded by the mystery which derives 
from lost works, from the reputation of wizardry. It is said that, as a young boy 
in the street market in Florence, he bought cage-birds just to set them free. He 
did the same for the secrets of art and nature. He lived his last years in France, in 
the service of Francis I. He died in the Chateau de Cloux near Amboise on the 
Loire-in a part of the world which has been called 'an Italy more Italian than 
Italy itself'.- [Leonardo] 

The Renaissance was never confined to Italy or to Italian fashions, and its 
effects were steadily disseminated throughout Latin Christendom. Modern 






scholars sometimes overlook this fact. Such was the impact of the work of the 
Swiss historian Jakob Burckhardt, Die Kultur der Renaissance in Italien (Basle, 
1860) that many people have been left unaware of the wider dimensions. In fact, 
the intellectual ferment of the period was observable from an early date in 
northern Europe, especially in the cities of Burgundy and Germany. In France it 
displayed many native strands in addition to imported Italian fashions. Nor was 
it confined to Italy's immediate neighbours: it affected Hungary and Poland, for 
example, more deeply than Spain; and it met no insurmountable barrier until it 
reached the borders of the Orthodox world. Traces of the Renaissance were 
slight in countries absorbed by the Ottoman Empire; and in Muscovy they were 
limited to a few artistic imitations. Indeed, by giving a new lease of life to the 
Latin West, the Renaissance only deepened the gulf between East and West. 


FLAGELLATIO 

Piero della francesca (c.1415-92) painted the small study generally 
known as The Flagellation some time between 1447 and 1460. The picture, 
now in the Galleria Nazionale at Urbino, is remarkable for its diptych 
structure, for its architectural detail, for its stunning use of perspective, and, 
above all, for its enigmatic allegory (see Plate 39). 1 The picture is divided 
into two distinct zones. On the left, a nocturnal flagellation scene takes place 
in the pearly interior of an antique courtyard. On the right, three large male 
figures converse in an open garden. The pale moonlight on the left is 
diffused by the daylight flooding in from the right. 

The architectural elements are strangely ambiguous. The praetorium 
courtyard is severely classical. The heavy roof panels are supported by two 
rows of fluted Corinthian columns rising from a marble pavement. In the 
centre, a prisoner is tied to the column of the Helia Capitolina, symbol of 
Jerusalem, surmounted by a golden statue. Yet two medieval houses with an 
overhanging belvedere appear alongside. Beyond is a patch of greenery and 
of blue sky. One section of the picture, therefore, was set in the past, the 
other in the present. 

The two groups of figures do not betray any obvious connection. The 
flogging in the courtyard is watched by a seated official who wears a pointed 




'Palaeologi' hat, by a turbaned Arab or Turk, and by an attendant in a short 
Roman toga. The foreground group in the garden consists of a bearded 
Greek dressed in round hat, maroon robe, and soft boots, a barefoot youth in 
red smock and laurel wreath, and a rich merchant dressed in a Flemish-style 
fur-hemmed brocade. 

Piero uses perspective drawing to ensure that the small figure of the 
prisoner remains the central focus. The convergent lines of the beams, the 
roof panels and the columns, and the foreshortened marble squares of the 
pavement constitute a textbook exposition of an architectural setting which 
emphasizes the action within it. 2 

As for the allegory, a prominent exponent of Piero's art has stated that 
the conflicting interpretations are too numerous to mention. 3 The 
conventional view holds that The Flagellation portrays the scourging of 
Christ before Pilate. Many commentators have identified the barefoot youth 
as Oddantonio di Montefeltro. Yet the Byzantine accents are strong; and they 
suggest a number of interpretations connected to the Ottoman siege and 
conquest of Constantinople which dominated the news in the period. In 
which case, the prisoner may not be Christ, but St Martin, the seventh- 
century Roman Pope who met martyrdom at Byzantine hands. The presiding 
official may not be Pilate, but the Byzantine Emperor. The three foreground 
figures could be participants in the Council of Mantua (1459), where a 
Greek emissary begs the Western princes to mount a crusade to rescue the 
Eastern Empire. 

A leading British authority, however, is adamant that the picture 
represents The Dream of St Jerome. Jerome once dreamed that he was being 
flogged for reading the pagan Cicero. This would explain the discordance 
between the two sections. The three foreground figures-two men and 'a 
barefoot angel'-'are discussing the relation between classical and patristic 
literature embodied in the story of St Jerome's dream'. 4 

Linear perspective was the artistic sensation of the era. 5 It so excited Piero's 
contemporary, Paolo Uccello, that he would wake his wife in bed to discuss 
it. It was a pictorial system for creating a realistic image of the three- 
dimensional world on a flat, two-dimensional surface. It set out to present 
the world as seen by the human eye, and as such marked a fundamental 
rejection of the hieratical proportions of medieval art. It was first discovered 



by Brunelleschi in his explorations of classical architecture, and expounded 
in many theoretical treatises headed by Alberti's De Pictura (1435), by 
Piero's own De Prospettiva Pingendi (pre-1475), and by Diirer's Treatise on 
Measurement (1525). Its rules included the pictorial convergence of parallel 
lines towards an illusory 'vanishing-point' and 'horizon line', the decreasing 
size of objects in relation to their distance from the 'viewing point', and the 
foreshortening of features lying along the central line of vision.- The 
pioneering examples of the system are to be found in the bronze panels of 
Ghiberti's 'Gates of Paradise' (1401-24) in the Baptistery at Florence, and in 
Masaccio's fresco of the Trinity (c.1427) in the nave of St Maria Novella. 
Other standard items include Uccello's Battle/e of San Romagno (c.1450), 
Mantegna's Lamentation over the Dead Christ (c.1480), and Leonardo's 
Last Supper (1497). 

Perspective was to dominate representational art for the next 400 years. 
Leonardo called it 'the rein and rudder of painting'. A modern critic was to 
call it 'a uniquely European way of seeing'.- Naturally, when modern artists 
eventually began to deconstruct traditional methods, linear perspective 
became one of their targets. Giorgio de Chirico (1888-1978) and his Scuola 
Metafisica explored the effects of dislocated perspective in paintings such as 
The Disquieting Muses (1917), as did Paul Klee in his Phantom Perspective 
(1920). It was left to the Dutchman M. C. Escher (1898-1970) to invent the 
visual riddles which show that in the last resort all lines on paper deal in 
illusions, [impression] 


LEONARDO 

Leonardo da vinci (1452-1519) was a left-handed, homosexual engineer, 
best known for his sideline in painting. He was the love-child of a Florentine 
lawyer and a peasant girl from the village of Vinci. He is widely rated the 
most versatile of all Europe's 'geniuses'. Only a dozen or so of his paintings 
have survived, some of them unfinished. But they include a number of 
supreme masterpieces, including the Mona Lisa in Paris, the Last Supper in 
Milan, and the Lady with Otter in Cracow. His left-handedness caused him 








to write backwards, in a script that can only be read with a mirror. His sexual 
proclivity led him to support a parasitic companion, called Salai, and to live 
in constant fear of prosecution. His most valuable legacy may well lie in his 
voluminous scientific notebooks, containing sketches and explanations of 
thousands of devices and inventions which never saw the light of day. 1 Not 
surprisingly, he has constantly attracted the attentions of all who try to 
measure the ingredients of genius. His name features on all sorts of lists of 
prominent Europeans who have allegedly shared his characteristics:

youthful paintings were good enough to be misattributed to Michelangelo. 
But he died before his genius matured. 3

The causes of the Renaissance were as deep as they were broad. They can be 
related to the growth of cities and of late medieval trade, to the rise of rich and 
powerful capitalist patrons, to technical progress which affected both economic 




and artistic life. But the source of spiritual developments must be sought above 
all in the spiritual sphere. Here, the malaise of the Church, and the despondency 
surrounding the Church's traditional teaching, becomes the major factor. It is no 
accident that the roots of Renaissance and Reformation alike are found in the 
realm of ideas. 

The New Learning of the fifteenth century possessed three novel features. 
One was the cultivation of long-neglected classical authors, especially those 
such as Cicero or Homer who had not attracted the medieval schoolmen. The 
second was the cultivation of ancient Greek as an essential partner to Latin. The 
third was the rise of biblical scholarship based on the critical study of the 
original Hebrew and Greek texts. This last activity provided an important bond 
between the secular Renaissance and the religious Reformation which was to 
place special emphasis on the authority of the Scriptures. Scholarly criticism of 
classical texts was growing rapidly long before the advent of printing. The lead, 
here again, had been given by Petrarch. He was emulated by Boccaccio, by 
Guarino, Filelfo, Bruni, Aurispa, and by that indefatigable collector and papal 
secretary G. F. Poggio Bracciolini (1380-1459). Poggio's rival Lorenzo Valla 
(c. 1406-57), was responsible both for the treatise De Elegantiis Latinae 
Linguae, which established the superiority of Ciceronian Latin, and for the 
exposure of the false Donation of Constantine. The Greek tradition, fostered by 
the Byzantine Manuel Chrysoloras (1355-1415) , sometime Professor of Greek 
at Florence, and by Angelo Poliziano (1454-94) poet and translator of Homer, 
was boosted by the wave of Greek refugees and their manuscripts after 1453. A 
later generation of scholars was dominated in Italy by the hellenist and 
orientalist G. Pico della Mirandola (1463-94), who explored the cabala, and by 
Marsilio Ficino (1433-99); in France by Jacques Lefevre d'Etaples (1455-1537) 
and Guillaume Bude (1467-1540); in Germany by the Hebraist Johann Reuchlin 
(1455-1522), by the wandering knight Ulrich von Hutten (1488-1523), and by 
Philip Melanchthon (1497-1560). Particularly relevant for the future of science 
was Ficino's translation of the Alexandrian Hermes Trismegistus. The printing- 

machine made its entree when the movement was well advanced, [cabala] 
[PRESS] 

Enthusiastic circles of such 'humanists' sprang up at all points, from Oxford 
and Salamanca to Cracow and Lwow. Their patrons, from Cardinal Beaufort to 
Cardinal Olesnicki, were often prominent churchmen. All, in their devotion to 
the ancients, would have echoed the cri de coeur of one of their lesser brethren, 
Cyriac of Ancona: 'I go to wake the dead.' All paid homage to the greatest of 



their number-Erasmus of Rotterdam. 

Gerhard Gerhards (c. 1466-1536), a Dutchman from Rotterdam better known 
by his Latin and Greek pen-names of 'Desiderius' and 'Erasmus', was the 
principal practitioner of Christian humanism. Scholar at Deventer, chorister at 
Utrecht, secretary to the Bishop of Cambrai, frequent visitor to London and 
Cambridge, and long-term resident of Basle, Erasmus 'made himself the centre 
of the scientific study of Divinity... the touchstone of classical erudition and 
literary taste'. 6 One of the first truly popular authors of the age of printing-his 
Moriae Encomium (Folly's Praise of Folly, 1511) ran into 43 editions in his 
lifetime-he did more than anyone else to marry the new humanism with the 
Catholic tradition. His Enchiridion Militis Christiani (Handbook of a Christian 
Soldier, 1503) was another winner. Like his close friend Thomas More, he was 
no less a Pauline than a Platonist. His publication of the Greek New Testament 
(1516) was a landmark event. Its Preface contained the famous words: 


I wish that every woman might read the Gospel and the Epistles of St Paul. Would that these were translated 
into every language ... and understood not only by Scots and Irishmen but by Turks and Saracens. Would 
that the farmer might sing snatches of Scripture at his plough, that the weaver might hum phrases of 
Scripture to the tune of his shuttle ... 7 

Most attractive, perhaps, was his beautifully paradoxical temperament. He was a 
priest with a strong streak of anticlericalism; a scholar with a deep loathing of 
pedantry; a royal and imperial pensioner who lacerated kings and princes; a true 
protestant against the abuses of the Church who took no part in the Reformation; 
a devoted humanist and a devoted Christian. His books remained on the 
Church's Index for centuries but were freely printed in England, Switzerland, 
and the Netherlands. He sported both a gentle spirit of moderation and a savage 
wit. 'What disasters would befall', he asked of the Rome of Julius II, 'if ever the 
supreme pontiffs, the Vicars of Christ, should make the attempt to imitate His 
life of poverty and toil?' The answer was that 'thousands of scribes, sycophants 
... muleteers ... and pimps' would become unemployed. 8 'Christ too', he wrote 
to the outrage of the Inquisition, 'was made something of a fool himself, in order 
to help the folly of mankind. '- 

Erasmus greatly influenced the language of the age. His collection of 
annotated Adagia (1508) was the world's first bestseller, bringing over 3,000 
classical proverbs and phrases into popular circulation: 


oleum camino 
ululas Athenas 
iugulare mortuos 
mortuum flagellas 
asinus ad lyram 
arare litus 
surdo oppedere 
mulgere hircum 
barba tenus sapientes 


(to pour) oil on the fire 
(to send) owls to Athens 
to cut the throat of corpses 
you are flogging a dead (horse) 
(to put) an ass to the lyre 
to plough the seashore 
to belch before the deaf 
to milk a billy goat 
wise as far as the beard.- 


Humanism is a label given to the wider intellectual movement of which the 
New Learning was both precursor and catalyst. It was marked by a fundamental 
shift from the theocratic or God-centred world-view of the Middle Ages to the 
anthropocentric or man-centred view of the Renaissance. Its manifesto may be 
seen to have been written by Pico's treatise On the Dignity of Man; and, in time, 
it diffused all branches of knowledge and art. It is credited with the concept of 
human personality, created by the new emphasis on the uniqueness and worth of 
individuals. It is credited with the birth of history, as the study of the processes 
of change, and hence of the notion of progress; and it is connected with the 
stirrings of science-that is, the principle that nothing should be taken as true 
unless it can be tried and demonstrated. In religious thought, it was a necessary 
precondition for Protestant emphasis on the individual conscience. In art it was 
accompanied by renewed interest in the human body and in the uniqueness of 
human faces. In politics it gave emphasis to the idea of the sovereign state as 
opposed to the community of Christendom, and hence to the beginnings of 
modern nationality. The sovereign nation-state is the collective counterpart of the 
autonomous human person, [state] 

Both in its fondness for pagan antiquity and in its insistence on the exercise 
of man's critical faculties, Renaissance humanism contradicted the prevailing 
modes and assumptions of Christian practice. Notwithstanding its intentions, 
traditionalists believed that it was destructive of religion, and ought to have been 
restrained. Five hundred years later, when the disintegration of Christendom was 
far more advanced, it has been seen by many Christian theologians as the source 
of all the rot. According to one Catholic philosopher: 


The difference between the Renaissance and the Middle Ages was not a difference by addition but by 
subtraction. The Renaissance ... was not the Middle Ages plus Man, but the Middle Ages minus God. 


An American Protestant was no less forgiving: The Renaissance is the real 
cradle of that very un-Christian concept: the autonomous individual.' A Russian 


Orthodox was the most uncompromising of all: 

Renaissance humanism affirmed the autonomy of man, and his freedom in the spheres of cultural creation, 
science and art. Herein lay its truth, for it was essential that the creative force of humanity should surmount 
the obstacles and prohibitions that mediaeval Christianity put in its way. Unfortunately, however, the 
Renaissance also began to assert man's self-sufficiency, and to make a rift between him and the eternal 
truths of Christianity ... Here we have the fountain-head of the tragedy of modern history.... God became 
the enemy of Man, and man the enemy of God.- 

By the same token, many people in recent times who do not hide their 
contempt for Christianity-Marxists, scientific sociologists, and atheists among 
them-have welcomed the Renaissance as the beginning of Europe's liberation. 
Nothing would have horrified the Renaissance masters more. Few of them saw 
any contradiction between their humanism and their religion; and most modern 
Christians would agree. All the developments deriving from the Renaissance, 
from Cartesian rationalism to Darwinian science, have been judged by 
fundamentalists to be contrary to religion; yet Christianity has adapted, and has 
accommodated them. Left to itself, humanism will always find its logical 
destination in atheism. But mainstream European civilization did not follow that 
extreme road. Through all the conflicts which ensued, a new and ever-changing 
synthesis was found between faith and reason, tradition and innovation, 
convention and conviction. Despite the growing prominence of secular subjects, 
the overwhelming bulk of European art continued to be devoted to religious 
themes; and all the great masters were religious believers. Suitably enough, at 
the end of a long life, Michelangelo Buonarroti (1474-1564)-sculptor of the 
Florentine David (1504), painter of the Sistine Chapel, and architect of St Peter's 
dome-turned for consolation to devotional poetry: 

Giunto e gia '1 corso della vita mia, 
con tempestoso mar per fragil barca, 
al commun porto, ov'a render si varea 
conto e ragion d'ogni' opra trista e pia. 

Onde l'affettuosa fantasia, 
che l'arte me fece idol' e monarca, 
conosco or ben, com'era d'error carca, 
e quel c'a mal suo grado ogn'uom desia. 

Gli amorosi pensier, gia vani e lieti, 
che fien'or, s'a due morti m'awicino? 

D'una so '1 certo, e 1' altra mi minaccia. 

Ne pinger ne scolpir fia piu che quieti 


l'anima volta a quell' Amor divino 
c'aperse, a prender noi, 'n croce le braccia. 


(The course of my life has come, | by fragile ship through stormy seas, | to the common port, where one 
calls | to give account of all our evil and pious deeds. | Whence the fond fantasy, | which made Art my idol 
and monarch, | I now know to have been a cargo of error, | and see what every man desires to his own harm. 
| Those thoughts of love, once light and gay, | what of them if now two deaths beset me? | I know the 
certainty of one, whilst the other oppresses. | Nor painting nor sculpture brings real repose; | my soul turns 
to that love divine | which, to enfold us, opens its arms on the cross.)- 


Education played a capital role in Renaissance thinking. The humanists knew 
that to create a New Man one had to start from schoolboys and students. 
Educational treatises and experiments proliferated-from Vittorino da Feltre to 
Erasmus's Instruction of a Prince. Their ideal, whilst conserving the bedrock of 
Christian instruction, was to develop both the mental and the physical talents of 
youth. To this end, gymnastics were taught alongside Greek and Latin. 
Vittorino's academy in Mantua is often taken to be the first school of the new 
type. Later examples included the refounded St Paul's School (1512) in London. 

Renaissance music was marked by the appearance of secular choral music 
alongside polyphonic settings for the Mass. The supreme masters, Josquin des 
Pres (c. 1445-1521) and Clement Jannequin (c. 1485-1558), whose work was 
much prized in Italy as well as France, painted panoramas in sound. Pieces such 
as Jannequin's Les Oiseaux, Les Cris de Paris, or La Bataille de Marignan 
abound with joy and energy. The art of the madrigal was widely disseminated, 
plied by an international school of lutenists. 

Textbooks of Renaissance art tend to divide the subject into three neat 
periods. The Early Renaissance of fifteenth-century 'innovation' is followed by 
the High Renaissance of'harmony attained' in the mid-sixteenth century, and by 
imitative Mannerism thereafter. The great innovative figures include Paolo 
Uccello (1397-1475), conqueror of perspective, Andrea Mantegna (1431-1506), 
master of realistic action, and Sandro Botticelli (1446-1510), the magical 
blender of landscape and human form. The three supreme giants are generally 
acknowledged to be Leonardo, Raphael Santi (1483-1520), and the mighty 
Michelangelo. The imitators, of course, were legion. But imitation is a form of 
flattery, and the treatment of the human face and body, of landscape and fight, 
was transformed. Raphael's Madonnas are a world apart in spirit from medieval 
icons. 

Yet over-neat classifications must be resisted. For one thing, innovation 


continued. Nothing could be more innovative in the use of form and colour than 
the daring canvases of Antonio Allegri (Correggio, 1489-1534), of the Venetians 
Tiziano Vercelli (Titian, 1477-1576) and Jacopo Robusti (Tintoretto, 1518-94), 
or of the Cretan Domenico Theotocopuli (El Greco, c.1541-1614), who found 
his way via Venice to Toledo. For another, the art of northern Europe, first 
prominent in Burgundy, developed strongly and independently. The German 
school forming around Albrecht Diirer (1471-1528), Lucas Cranach of 
Nuremberg (1472-1553), the landscapist Albrecht Altdorfer of Regensburg 
(1480-1538), and the portraitist Hans Holbein of Augsburg (1497-1543), was in 
contact with the South, but was anything but derivative. Finally, one has to take 
account of powerful and original artists who were more closely connected with 
continuing medieval traditions. Such would include the extraordinary altar- 
carver Veit Stoss or Wit Stwosz (c. 1447-1533), who worked in Germany and 
Poland, the mysterious Master of Griinewald (C. 1460-1528), the fantastic 
Dutchman Hieronymus Bosch (d. 1516), with his visions of Hell, or the Flemish 
'peasant genre' painter Pieter Bruegel the Elder (c. 1525-69). 

Renaissance architecture is usually characterized by reactions against the 
Gothic style. The Florentine 'classical style', whose earliest example is to be 
found in the Pazzi Chapel (1430), had many admirers. The classical villas of 
Andrea Palladio (1518-80) became an obsession with the European nobility. His 
finely illustrated Quattro Libri della Architectura (1570), published in Venice, 
was placed in all respectable libraries. When gunpowder rendered castles 
obsolete, building funds were spent on magnificent palaces, notably in the 
aristocratic residences of the Loire; on the monuments to municipal pride in the 
burgher houses and arcaded squares of Germany and Holland; and on Italianate 
city halls from Amsterdam to Augsburg, Leipzig, and Zamosc 

Renaissance literature was characterized by an explosion of the vernacular 
languages, which saw the world afresh in every way. The tentative work of the 
humanists gave way in the sixteenth century to the launch of full-blown national 
literatures. Indeed, the possession of a popular literary tradition in the vernacular 
was to become one of the key attributes of modern national identity. This 
tradition was established in French by the poets of the Pleiade, in Portuguese by 
Luiz de Camoens (1524-80), in Spanish by Miguel Cervantes (1547-1616), in 
Dutch by Anna Bijns (c.1494-1575) and Joost van den Vondel (b. 1587), in 
Polish by Jan Kochanowski (1530-84), in English by the Elizabethan poets and 
dramatists Spenser, Marlowe, and Shakespeare. In Italian, where the tradition 
was older and stronger, it was consolidated by Ludovico Ariosto (1474-1533) 



and Torquato Tasso (1544-95). [singularis] 

Not all of Europe's linguistic communities produced serious literature. Those 
who lagged behind, principally in Germany, Russia, and the Balkans, were still 
preoccupied with religious pursuits. Apart from Luther and the Narrenschiff or 
'Ship of Fools' (1494) of Sebastian Brant (1457-1527), the poetry of the 
Silesians, Andreas Gryphius (1616-69) and Martin Opitz (1597-1639), 
historiographer to the King of Poland, and the picaresque novel Simplicissimus 
of H.J.C. von Grimmelshausen (c. 1625-76), little of note was published in 
Germany beyond religious tracts and popular Volksbiicher such as the story of 
Doktor Faustus (1657) [faustus], In Central Europe, an important branch of 
literature continued to be wirtten in Latin. The chief exponents of neo-Latin 
poetry included the German Conrad Pickel, alias 'Celtis' (1459-1508), first poet 
laureate of the Holy Roman Empire; Ianus Pannonius (1434-72), the Hungarian; 
the Italians Fracastorius (1483-1553) and Alciati (1492-1550); and the Poles 
Dantiscus (1485-1548) and Ianicius (1516-43). 

Clearly, the Renaissance had something in common with the older movement 
for Church reform. Humanists and would-be reformers both fretted against 
fossilized clerical attitudes, and both suffered from the suspicions of the ruling 
hierarchy. What is more, by encouraging the critical study of the New Testament, 
both led the rising generation to dream about the lost virtues of primitive 
Christianity, much as others had dreamt about the lost age of classical Antiquity. 
In this connection, but not in the happiest of metaphors, it used to be said that 
'Erasmus laid the egg and Luther hatched it'. 

The Reformation. None the less, it is not possible to view the Reformation 
simply as an extension of the Renaissance. Unlike humanism, it appealed to the 
deepest devotional traditions of the Middle Ages, and it rode on a wave of a 
religious revival which affected not just the scholars but the masses. It was 
launched by men who had every intention of keeping the Catholic Church intact, 
and who only redoubled their campaign for a cleansed and unified religion when 
one branch of the reforming movement began to break away. It had nothing at all 
to do with the humanist spirit of tolerance. The common well springs of 
Renaissance and Reformation, therefore, should not be allowed to conceal the 
fact that they grew into streams flowing in very different directions. A similar 
split developed within the movement for Church reform. What started as a broad 
religious revival gradually divided into two separate and hostile movements, 



later known as the Catholic Reformation and the Protestant Reformation. 


SINGULARIS 

I ndividualism is widely billed as one of the inherent qualities of 'Western I 
civilization', and Michel de Montaigne could claim to be one of the pioneer 
individualists: 

The greatest thing on earth is to know how to belong to oneself. Everyone 
looks in front of them. But I look inside myself. I have no concerns but my 
own. I constantly reflect on myself; I control myself; I taste myself... We 
owe some things in part to society, but the greater part to ourselves. It is 
necessary to lend oneself to others, but to give oneself only to oneself. 1 

The roots of individualism have been identified in Platonism, in Christian 
theology of the soul, in the nominalism of medieval philosophy. 2 But the 
main surge came with the Renaissance, which Burckhardt characterized by 
its brilliant individuals. The cultural interest in human beings, the religious 
interest in private conscience, and the economic interest in capitalist 
enterprise all put the individual centre stage. Starting with Locke and 
Spinoza, the Enlightenment elaborated the theme until the 'liberty of the 
individual' and 'human rights' joined the common stock of European 
discourse. 

In the nineteenth century individualist theory developed along several 
divergent tracks. Kant had remarked that the unrestrained pursuit of self- 
interest was immoral; and it was left to John Stuart Mill On Liberty (1850) to 
reconcile the conflicting interests of individuals and of society. In Socialisme 
et liberte (1898) Jean Jaures undertook a similar exercise in socialist terms. 
Yet there were always people ready to pursue the extremes. In The 
Individual and His Property (1844) Max Stirner condemned all forms of 
collective, whether 'nation', 'state', or 'society'. In The Soul of Man under 
Socialism (1891) Oscar Wilde defended the absolute rights of the creative 
artist: 'Art is the most intense mode of individualism that the world has 
known.' 




In the twentieth century, both communism and fascism treated the 
individual with contempt. Even in democratic states, bloated government 
bureaucracies often oppressed those whom they were created to serve. The 
neo-liberal response gathered pace in the 'Vienna School' of the 1920s. Its 
leaders-Karl Popper (b. 1902), Ludwig von Mises (1881-1973), and 
Friedrich von Hayek (b. 1899)-all emigrated. Hayek's Road to Serfdom 
(1944) and Individualism and the Economic Order (1949) educated the 
postwar neo-conservatives. A fervent disciple once indignantly proclaimed: 
There is no such thing as society.' 3 

Such excesses tended to present the citizen as a mere consumer of goods, 
services, and rights. Politics threatened to degenerate into a 'culture of 
complaint'. At some point, the counter-tendency was due to reassert itself in 
the equally venerable tradition of Duty. 4 


The religious revival, clearly visible at the end of the fifteenth century, was 
largely driven by popular disgust at the decadence of the clergy. Despite the 
declared intention of calling a General Council every ten years, the Church had 
not called one since the 1430s. The canonization of a long line of saints, from St 
Vincent Ferrer OP (cd. 1455) and St Bernardino of Siena (cd. 1450) to St 
Casimir of Poland (1458-84), could not detract from the blatant lack of 
saintliness in the Church as a whole. Europe was full of tales about simoniac 
bishops, nepotistic popes, promiscuous priests, idle monks, and, above all, the 
sheer worldly wealth of the Church. 

Once again, the harbinger of things to come appeared in Florence. The 
ferocious hellfire sermons of a fanatical friar, Fra Girolamo Savonarola (1452- 
98), raised a revolt in the 1490s which temporarily drove out the Medici and 
which only ended with the friar's own burning. In Spain, under Cardinal 
Cisneros, religious discipline was combined with energetic scholarship. The new 
school of theology at the University of Alcala, founded in 1498, gave birth to the 
Polyglot Bible (1510-20). In Italy, under Cardinal Giampietro Carafa (1476- 
1559), the future Paul IV and co-founder c.1511 of the Oratory of Divine Love, 
an influential circle of Roman churchmen bound themselves to a regime of 
intense devotional exercises and practical charity. From them there arose a series 
of new Catholic congregations of clerks regular, neither monks nor friars- 
among them the Theatines (1523), the Barnabites (1528), the Jesuits (1540), and 




the Oratorians (1575). 

The stirrings of religious revival coincided with the nadir of the Church's 
reputation, reached during the papacies of Rodrigo de Borgia (Alexander VI, 
1492-1503) and Giuliano della Rovere (Julius II, 1503-13). Alexander's 
passions were for gold, women, and the careers of his bastard children. Julius 
gratified 'an innate love of war and conquest': he is remembered as the pope 
who rode into battle in full armour, the rebuilder of St Peter's, the refounder of 
the Papal States. In 1509, when he was planning to pay for his wars and for St 
Peter's through the sale in Germany of 'indulgences'-paper certificates 
guaranteeing relief from punishment in Purgatory-Rome was visited by a 
young Augustinian monk from Wittenberg in Saxony. Martin Luther was 
shocked to the bones by what he saw. 'Even depravity', wrote Ranke, 'may have 
its perfection.'- 

Within ten years Luther (1483-1546) found himself at the head of the first 
'Protestant' revolt. His lectures as Professor of Theology at Wittenberg show that 
his doctrine of'justification by faith alone' had been brewing for some years; and 
as a man wresding with his inner convictions, he had little patience with the 
gentle humanists of the day. He was inordinately rude and bad-tempered. His 
language was often unrepeatable. Rome, to him, was the seat of sodomy and the 
Beast of the Apocalypse. 

Luther's fury was brought to the boil by the appearance in Germany of a 
friar, Johann Tetzel, who was selling indulgences. Tetzel had been banned from 
the territory of the Elector of Saxony, who had no desire to see his subjects 
pouring large sums into papal coffers. So by challenging Tetzel's theological 
credentials, Luther was reinforcing the policy of his Prince. On 31 October 1517, 
All Saints' Eve, he took the fateful step of nailing a sheet of 95 Theses, or 
arguments against indulgences, to the door of Wittenberg's castle church. Or 
tradition so insists. 

From that famous act of defiance several consequences flowed. First, Luther 
was embroiled in a series of public disputations, notably the one staged at 
Leipzig with Dr von Eck which preceded his formal excommunication (June 
1520). In the course of his preparations he penned the primary treatises of 
Lutheranism-the Resolutions, Liberty of a Christian Man, Address to the 
Christian Nobility of German Nation, On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church 
of God; and he publicly burned the papal Bull of Excommunication, Exsurge 
Domine. Secondly, German politics was split between the advocates and the 


opponents of Luther's punishment. In 1521 the Emperor Charles V summoned 
Luther to appear under safe conduct before the Imperial Diet at Worms. Luther, 
like Hus at Constance, defended himself with fortitude: 


I am overcome by the Scriptures I have quoted; my conscience is captive to God's Word. I cannot and will 
not revoke anything, for to act against conscience is neither safe nor honest ... Hier stehe ich. Ich kann 
nicht anders. [Here I stand. I cannot do otherwise.] 


After that, he was spirited away by the Saxon Elector's men and hidden in the 
Wartburg Castle. The ban pronounced by the Diet against Luther could not be 
enforced. Religious protest was turning into political revolt. 

Germany in 1522-5 was convulsed by two major outbursts of unrest: the 
feud of the Imperial Knights (1522-3) at Trier and the violent social disturbances 
of the Peasants' War (1524-5), which began at Waldshut in Bavaria. Luther's 
defiance of the Church may have been a factor in the defiance of political 
authority; but he had no sympathy for the peasants' Twelve articles' drawn up in 
Swabia by Christoph Schappeler and Sebastian Lotzer of Memmingen. When 
fresh rebel bands appeared in Thuringia, Luther published his appeal Against the 
Murderous and Thieving Hordes of Peasants, trenchantly defending the social 
order and the princes' rights. The peasant rebels were crushed in a sea of blood. 

The Lutheran revolt took definite shape during three later sessions of the 
Imperial Diet. The Emperor's opponents took their chance to consolidate their 
position whilst he was distracted by the wars against France and the Turks. At 
Speyer in 1526, in the Recess Declaration of the Diet, they managed to insert a 
clause for princely liberty in religion anticipating the famous formula: Cuius 
regio, eius religio (whoever rules has the right to determine religion). At the 
second Diet of Speyer in 1529, they formally lodged the Protest which gave 
them their name, bemoaning the annulment of the Recess. At Augsburg in 1530, 
they presented a measured summary of their beliefs. This Confession of 
Augsburg, composed by Melanchthon, was the Protestant manifesto-after 
which an adamant Emperor set April 1531 as the deadline for their submission. 
In response, the Protestant princes formed the armed League of Schmalkalden. 

From then on, the Catholic and the Protestant camps were clearly defined, 
[GESANG] 


GESANG 




Martin Luther's paraphrase of Psalm 46-'God is our refuge and 
strength'-was first set to music in J. Klug's Gesangbuch of 1529. It showed 
that 'the nightingale of Wittenberg' was a poet and composer as well as 
church reformer and theologian. It turned out to be perhaps the greatest 
hymn in the Christian repertoire: 


F.IN- FF.STF. UURG H78766667 



Ein' feste Burg ist unser Gott, A safe stronghold our God is still, 
ein gute Wehr und Waffen. A trusty shield and weapon; 

Er hilft uns frei aus aller Not, He'll help us clear from all the ill 
die uns jetzt hat betroffen. That hath us now o'ertaken 

Der alt bose Feind The ancient prince of Hell 

mit Ernst er's jetzt meint. Hath risen with purpose fell; 

gross Macht und viel List, Strong mail of craft and power 
sein grausam Rtistung ist He weareth in this hour; 

auf Erd ist nich seins gleichen . 1 On earth is not his fellow . 2 

Luther, as a monk, was familiar with church music. He had a good tenor 
voice, and wanted all people to share his enjoyment of singing in church. 
Musical participation was to be the liturgical counterpart to his theological 
doctrine of the communion of all believers. He gave high priority to 
congregational music-making. His Formula Missae (1523) reformed the 
Latin Mass, providing a basis for the later Swedish liturgy. The Geystliche 
Gesangk Buchlein (1524), published by his disciple J. Walter, provided an 
anthology of polyphonic choral settings. In 1525 he brought the world's first 
musical press to Wittenberg. His Deutsche Messe und Ordnung Gottesdienst 
(1526) supplied a form of the vernacular sung Mass. It concluded with a 
version of the Hussite hymn 'Jesus Christus, unser Heiland'. Heinrich 
Lufft's Enchiridion (also 1526) constituted the first ever congregational 
hymn-book. Within five years of the Diet of Worms, Luther's followers were 
musically fully equipped. 

The Lutheran musical tradition had far-reaching consequences. It 















required every parish to keep its cantor, its organist, its choir school, and its 
body of trained singers and instrumentalists. As a result, it played a 
prominent role in turning Germany into the most musically educated nation 
in Europe-the richest resource for Europe's secular music-making. The 
genius of J. S. Bach could have found no more fertile soil than in 
Lutheranism. 

A hypothesis exists which maintains that it was the German language 
and its rhythms which lay at the root of Germany's musical pre-eminence. 
This may or may not be true. But one can find Luther saying in 1525 that 
'both text and notes, accent, melody and performance ought to grow from 
the true mother tongue and its reflections'. Luther's emphasis on the use of 
the vernacular deeply affected German education. There is a direct link 
between the hymns and masses of Luther, Walter. Rhaw, and Heinrich 
Schutz (1585-1672), and the later glories of Bach, Haydn, Mozart, 
Beethoven, Schubert, and Brahms. 3 

To celebrate the Lutheran tradition in isolation no doubt does a disservice 
to Catholic music, and to the fruitful interactions of various Christian 
traditions. But one only has to compare the sterile music of Calvinism, 
whose ban on 'Popish polyphony' reduced the Geneva Psalter (1562) to a 
collection of metrical unisons, to see the felicity of Luther's music-making. 

In many ways the Church of England shares Luther's musicality, 
developing a wonderful tradition launched by Tallis, Gibbons, and Byrd. In 
its stunning simplicity, Tallis's Canon, composed by a monk of Waltham 
Abbey who became a gentleman of the Chapel Royal, is the Anglican 
equivalent of Ein'feste Burg, and an eight-part round to boot: 


TALLIS'S CANON 8 8 8 8 (LM) 

























Glory to thee, my God, this night 
For all the blessings of the light. 

Keep me, oh keep me, King of Kings 
Beneath thine own almighty wings. 4 

Nor should one neglect the magnificent musical tradition of the 
Orthodox Church, which adopted polyphony as readily as Luther did. In this 
case the ban on musical instruments inspired a very special expertise in 
choral part-singing. The Catholic Church always permitted instrumental 
accompaniment. The earliest surviving church organ, dating from 1320, is 
still operational at Sion in the Valais. But in Russia and Ukraine the 
polyphony had to be generated by human voices alone, thereby fostering a 
culture which is as ready to make music as to appreciate it. In this context, 
Tchaikovsky was no more of an accident than Bach was. 


Meanwhile, the Lutheran protest movement was swelled by a series of 
parallel events, each of which widened the nature of Protestantism. In 1522 in 
Switzerland, Huldrych Zwingli (1484-1531), hellenist, correspondent of 
Erasmus, and 'people's priest' at Zurich, challenged the Roman Church both on 
ecclesiastical organization and on doctrine. Like Luther, he started by 
denouncing indulgences; and he shared Luther's concept of justification by faith. 
But he also rejected the authority of bishops; and he taught that the Eucharist 
was no more than a simple, symbolic ceremony. He was killed at Kappel in 
1531, carrying the Protestant banner in a war against the five Catholic forest 
cantons that had split the Swiss Confederation. He launched an important 
Protestant trend, in which local congregations or communities claimed the right 
to control their affairs, [holism] 

In the 1520s radical preachers and sects proliferated in Germany. Andreas 
Karlstadt (1480-1541), who quarrelled with Luther, went off to Basel. The 
'Prophets of Zwickau'-Storch, Stuebner and Thomae-were old-fashioned mil- 
lenarians. The mystic Thomas Muentzer (1490-1525), possessed both 
communist and anarchist traits, modelling his group on the Czech Taborites. 
After many wanderings, he was caught at the head of a band of expropriators 
during the Peasants' War in Thuringia, and executed at Muhlhausen. The 
Anabaptists or 'Rebaptisers' emerged among some disgruntled Swiss 
Zwinglians. Rejecting all established authority, they declared all previous 




baptisms invalid. They also sought to found an ideal Christian republic on 
evangelical principles, renouncing oaths, property, and (in theory) all violence. 
In 1534-5 at Munster in Westphalia under two Dutchmen-Jan Matthijs of 
Haarlem and Jan Beukelz of Leiden-they briefly created a 'Kingdom of the 
Elect' that was crushed with great cruelty. The cages which once held the 
remains of their leaders, still hang from the spire of St. Lambert's Church. The 
Anabaptists were Christendom's first fundamentalists, persecuted by Protestants 
and Catholics alike. They recovered as 'Mennonites' under the Frieslander, 
Menno Simons (1496-1561), sowing a spiritual legacy for later Baptists, 
Unitarians and Quakers. Christian Spiritualism, in contrast, drew support from 
Bavarian Denckians, Swabian Franckians and Silesian Schwenkfeldians. 


HOLISM 

In February 1528 the wonderful 'Dr Paracelsus' lost his brief appointment 
as Basle's city physician. He had been barred from the university, had 
offended the guild of apothecaries, and had sued a prelate for refusing to pay 
him a full professional fee. When he publicly accused the magistrates of 
bias, he risked arrest and fled. His ideas were no more acceptable to the 
scholastic medicine of his day than to the supposedly scientific medicine of a 
later age. 

Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim (1493- 
1541), known as Paracelsus, was born at Einsiedeln in the canton of Schwyz. 
He was the contemporary of Luther, Erasmus, and Michelangelo. He 
graduated from the medical faculty at Ferrara in 1524. But he dropped 
higher study and spent seven years travelling, learning the lore of herbalists, 
gypsies, and magicians, and earning his keep at the artisan grade of barber- 
surgeon. He visited Spain and Portugal, Russia and Poland, Scandinavia and 
Constantinople, Crimea and possibly Egypt. Formerly a Catholic, he often 
associated with the radical sects such as the Anabaptists and the Brethren of 
the Free Spirit. Arrested in Salzburg in 1525 for supporting rebellious 
peasants, he narrowly escaped execution. Apart from Basle, his longer 
sojourns were at Strasbourg, Nuremberg, St Gallen, Meran in Tyrol, St 
Moritz, Bad Pfeifers, Augsburg, Kromau in Moravia, Bratislava, Vienna and 




Villach. He was a prolific author on everything from theology to magic-the 
centrepiece being Opus Paramirium (1531), his 'Work Beyond Wonders'. 

Paracelsus rejected the reigning notion that medical knowledge was to be 
garnered from ancient texts. At Basle, he had joined some students who were 
burning the works of Avicenna. Instead, he proposed to learn on the one 
hand from practical observations and on the other from 'the four pillars'- 
natural philosophy, astrology, alchemy, and 'Virtue' (by which he meant the 
innate powers of people, plants, and minerals). His empirical bent led to a 
series of brilliant treatments and techniques in amputations, antisepsis, 
homeopathy, and balneology. His other lines led him to an alternative system 
of biochemistry based on sulphur, salt, and mercury, and gave him a lasting 
reputation for wizardry. Not for 400 years was even part of Europe's medical 
profession prepared to consider his holistic precept-that the good doctor 
seeks the harmony of all factors affecting the patient's well-being, including 
the environmental, the psychosomatic and the supernatural. 

Paracelsus lived at a time when no one understood the workings of the 
digestive, circulatory, neural, or reproductive systems, let alone genes or 
chromosomes. Yet many of his insights resonate across the centuries: 

Both the man and the woman each have half a seed, and the two together 
make a whole seed ... There is in the matrix [womb] an attractive force (like 
amber or a magnet)... Once the will has been determined, the matrix draws 
unto itself the seed of the woman and the man from the humours of the heart, 
the liver, the spleen, the bone, the blood ... and all that is in the body. For 
every part of the body has its own particular seed. But when all these seeds 
come together, they are only one seed. 1 


In 1529 King Henry VIII of England initiated the policy which was to 
separate the English Church from Rome. The initial cause lay in Henry's 
obsessive desire for a male heir and in the Pope's refusal to grant him a divorce. 
Henry, who had earlier earned the title of Fidei Defensor for denouncing Luther, 
had little religious motivation; but he gained great support in Parliament, and 
immense material advantage, by attacking the Church's privileges and property. 
The Act of Annates (1532) cut financial payments to Rome. The Act of Appeals 
(1533) curtailed Rome's ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The Act of Supremacy 




(1534) abolished papal authority completely, raising the King to be Supreme 
Head of the Church of England. Subjects such as Thomas More or Cardinal John 
Fisher, who declined to accede, were executed for treason. The Ten Articles 
(1536) and Six Articles (1539) asserted the inviolability of the Roman Mass and 
of traditional doctrine. The direct association of Church and State-later called 
Erastianism-brought Anglicanism closer to Orthodox than to Catholic practice, 

[UTOPIA] 

In 1541, at the second attempt, Jean Calvin (1509-64) was persuaded to take 
control of the church in Geneva. A fugitive Frenchman, more radical than 
Luther, Calvin founded the most widely influential branch of Protestantism. A 
scholar raised in the spirit of Lefevre d'Etaples and a sometime Catholic lawyer, 
he had been protected by the circle of Marguerite d'Angouleme. He was 
converted to the new thinking after hearing a homily on the sovereignty of the 
Scriptures by the Rector of the Sorbonne, Nicholas Cop. Fearing repressions, he 
resigned his benefice in his native Noyon and fled to Basle. There, in 1535, he 
published his seminal Institution de la religion chretienne. 

Calvin expressed original ideas on theology, on the relations of Church and 
State, and especially on private morality. He was nearer to Luther than to 
Zwingli on the Eucharist; but his revival of the doctrine of predestination proved 
shocking. He saw humanity to be divided into the Damned and the Elect. By 
this, he taught his disciples to think of themselves as an embattled minority, a 
band of righteous brothers surrounded by a hostile world, 'Strangers among 
Sinners': 

Ainsi les Bourgeois du Ciel n'aiment point le Monde, ni les choses qui sont au Monde ... il s'ecrient avec le 
Sage: 'Vanite des Vanites; tout n'est que vanite et rongement d'Esprit'. (The inhabitants of the city of 
Heaven do not love the World, nor the things of the World ... They cry with the Prophet, 'Vanity of 
vanities; everything is nothing but vanity and the devouring of the spirit.')- 

On Church organization, too, Calvin's innovations far exceeded those of 
Zwingli. He insisted not only on the separation of Church and State but also on 
the competence of local congregations. On the other hand, he also expected that 
the temporal power would be inspired by religious precepts, and by a desire to 
enforce all judgements of the Church organs. In matters of toleration, therefore, 
he was no more flexible than the Inquisition or Henry VIII. [syrop] 


UTOPIA 


Utopia, meaning 'No Place', was the name coined in 1516 by Sir Thomas 
More for his book describing his search for an ideal form of government. 
Translated into English in 1551, after the author's martyrdom, as A Frutefull, 
pleasant and wittie worke of the beste state of a publique weale, and of the 
new yle called Utopia, and also into French, German, Spanish, and Italian, it 
became a bestseller. In it More described a land where property was held in 
common, both men and women benefited from universal education, and all 
religions were tolerated. 1 

Utopian thinking supplies a deep human need for an ideal vision of a better 
world. The genre has attracted many practitioners, from Plato's Republic to 
Bacon's New Atlantis and Harrington's Oceana. Similar effects may be 
gained by imagining the horrors of Dystopia or 'Bad Place'. Such was the 
intent of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World (1932) or of George Orwell's 
Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949). In the twentieth century, utopianism has 
generally been associated with left-wing thinking. Soviet Russia was widely 
thought by its admirers to have been a modern utopia, free of the evils of 
capitalist democracy. 'I have seen the future,' said an American visitor in 
1919, 'and it works.' Such opinions have since been disgraced by knowledge 
of the mass murders committed in the name of 'socialism' and 'progress'. 
Modern liberals have moved on to the more humdrum task of bettering the 
lot of individuals. 2 [harvest] [Vorkuta] 

What is not so readily accepted is that Fascism too had its utopias. After 
the initial phase of brutal conquest, many Nazis, like many Communists, 
dreamed of a beautiful, harmonious future. The French writer 'Vercors', for 
example, recounts the musings of a German officer in occupied France, who 
looks forward to the glorious future of Franco-German union. 'It will be a 
replay of Beauty and the Beast'. 3 After the war, in Eastern Europe's 
Communist prisons, many democrats imprisoned for opposition to 
Communism had to listen to the broken dreams of their convicted Nazi cell¬ 
mates. 4 The Fascist utopia, like that of the Communists, was false, and 
generated immense suffering. But there were those who dreamed it sincerely, 



[LETTLAND] 


In ethical matters, Calvin established a new and inimitable code which made 
his followers instantly recognizable. The good Calvinist family was to abhor all 
forms of pleasure and frivolity-dancing, songs, drinking, gaming, flirtation, 
bright clothes, entertaining books, loud language, even vivacious gestures. Their 
life was to be marked by sobriety, self-restraint, hard work, thrift, and, above all, 
godliness. Their membership of the Elect was to be manifest in their appearance, 
in their conduct, in their church-going, and in their worldly success. To the old 
Catholic burden of sin they added the new burden of keeping up appearances. In 
art, they were to avoid all direct portrayal of the Deity, all mystical symbols and 
allegories. They were to find the sole source of joy and guidance in the daily 
reading of the Bible. Here was what the English-speaking world would come to 
know as the Puritan. 

The full formation of Calvinist principles had to await the definitive 
publication of the Institution in 1559 and the second Helvetic Confession, drawn 
up by H. Bullinger (1504-75), Zwingli's successor at Zurich, in 1566. 

Calvin's successor at Geneva, Theodore Beza (1519-1605), a Greek scholar 
and theologian, introduced a rigid, determinist view of predestination that was 
vigorously opposed by the followers of Jakub Hermans (Arminius, 1560-1609), 
Professor at Leyden in Holland. The Arminians emphasized the doctrine of free 
will, and the efficacy of Christ's death for all believers, not just for the Elect. 

The spread of Protestantism has to be described both in socio-political as 
well as in geographical terms. 

Lutheranism appealed directly to independent-minded princes. It confirmed 
the legitimacy of their rule whilst maintaining the existing social order. It was 
quickly adopted in several states-notably in Wurtemberg, Hesse, Anhalt, 
electoral and ducal Saxony, Neumark, and Pomerania-and in most north 
German cities from Bremen to Riga. It entered a prolonged crisis in 1540, when 
Luther condoned the bigamous marriage of Philip of Hesse by advising the new 
faith's leading patron To tell a good strong lie'. Until the Formula of Concord 
(1580), it survived several decades of schism between the strict 'Gnesio- 
Lutherans' and the more liberal 'Melanchthonians'. In Denmark and Norway, 
through the preaching of'the Danish Luther', Hans Tausen, it became the state 
religion in 1537. It helped perpetuate Denmark's loss of Sweden, where it was 




not fully established until 1593; and it accelerated the collapse of the Teutonic 
States in Prussia (1525) and in Livonia (1561). 

Calvinism, in contrast, coincided less with state politics than with the 
inclinations of particular social groups. In Western Europe it often appealed to 
the rising urban bourgeoisie, and in France to an impressive cross-section of the 
nobility. In Eastern Europe, also, it appealed both to the landed gentry and to the 
magnates. In the kingdom of England, Calvinism began to make an impact after 
the death of Henry VIII in 1547. The reign of the boy king Edward VI produced 
much confusion, and the interval of the ultra-Catholic Queen Mary, a crop of 
Protestant martyrs, notably at Oxford. Thereafter, under Elizabeth I, the Church 
Settlement enshrined in the Act of Uniformity (1559) and the Thirty-Nine 
Articles (1571) reached a judicious synthesis of Erastian, Lutheran, Zwinglian, 
Calvinist, and traditional Catholic influences. From then on, Anglicanism has 
always provided an umbrella for two main political and theological tendencies- 
the 'High Church' of Anglo-Catholicism and the 'Low Church' of the Calvinistic 
evangelicals. Despite merciless persecution under Elizabeth, both recusant 
Catholics and non-conformist puritans survived underground. The latter re- 
emerged in force in the seventeenth century and, under Cromwell's 
Commonwealth (1649-58), briefly controlled the state. 


SYROP 

On Saturday, 12 August 1553 a fugitive from the Holy Inquisition rode into 
the village of Louyset on the French side of Geneva. Four months earlier he 
had been arrested in Lyons on charges of heresy and, after interrogation by 
the Inquisitor General, condemned to death. He had escaped from prison, 
and had been wandering ever since. His aim was to take a boat across the 
lake from Geneva, and to make for Zurich. Geneva was the stronghold of 
Calvin, Zurich of the Zwinglians. 

Prior to his arrest, the fugitive had been employed as physician to the 
Archbishop of Vienne. A native of Navarre, he had studied at Toulouse, 
Paris, Louvain, and Montpellier. He was the author of several medical 
treatises, of a study of Ptolemy's Geography, and of two anti-trinitarian 
theological works -De Trinitatis Erroribus (1521) and the anonymous 




Christianismi restitutio (1553). For the past eight years he had corresponded 
with some animosity with Calvin, whom he had once met. 1 

On the Sunday, having sold his horse, he walked into Geneva, found a 
room at La Rose, and went to an afternoon service. In church, he was 
recognized by someone and denounced to the city authorities. By the next 
morning he was facing the same questions from a Calvinist interrogator that 
he had faced from the Catholic Inquisitor. He was Fr. Miguel Serveto de 
Villanova, otherwise 'Servetus' (1511-53). 

Calvin's conduct towards Servetus was, to put it mildly, unchristian. He 
had once warned him against coming to Geneva. He had even supplied the 
Inquisition at Lyons with a specimen of his correspondent's handwriting. He 
now set aside Geneva's laws concerning religious toleration, and 
recommended that Servetus be beheaded. Instead, by order of the court, he 
was burned alive at Champel on 27 October. 

Nowhere in Europe could radical thinkers feel really safe. The Russian 
Orthodox Church had burned its 'Judaizers'. Byzantium, too, had its 
Inquisition. Giordano Bruno (1548-1600), philosopher and renegade 
Dominican, who was burned at the stake in Rome, was also, it seems, an 
English spy. 2 Poland-Lithuania was an isolated haven, where from 1565 
episcopal courts could not enforce their verdicts. The anti-trinitarians tarried 
in Transylvania before moving on to Poland. Their leader, the Siennese 
Fausto Sozzini (1539-1604) to whom Servetus is sometimes compared, had 
also lived in Lyons and Geneva, where, enrolled in the Italian Church, he 
had kept quiet. 

Long after his death, Servetus was remembered as a symbol of the 
interdependence of Protestant and Catholic bigotry. Monuments to his 
memory would be erected in Madrid (1876), Paris (1907), and Vienne 
(1910). Had he lived longer, he would have enjoyed the success of the four 
editions of his work on medicinal syrops, Syroporum universa ratio (1537). 


Thanks to the efforts of John Knox (1513-72), Calvinism became the sole 
established religion in Scotland in 1560, in a form known as Presbyterianism. 
Though subject to Anglican influences, the Scottish Kirk stayed apart. 

In France the Calvinists were dubbed Huguenots. They spread rapidly in the 




former Albigensian lands in the south and west, and in the urban populations of 
all provinces. They formed the backbone of the Bourbon Party during the Wars 
of Religion, and an essential feature of the French religious scene until their 
ultimate expulsion in 1685. 

In the Netherlands the rise of Calvinism, especially among the burghers of 
Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Leyden, provided a basic factor in the split between 
the Catholic provinces to the west and the United Provinces to the east. The 
Dutch Reformed Church has played a central role in the country since its 
establishment as the state religion in 1622. 

In Germany Calvinism was long opposed both by Lutherans and Catholics. It 
received its major support from the adherence in 1563 of the Elector-Palatine, 
Frederick III, who imposed the Heidelberg Catechism on all his subjects; from 
Christian I of Saxony (d. 1591), and in 1613 from the conversion of the 
Hohenzollerns of Brandenburg. Brandenburg-Prussia was unusual in tolerating 
both Calvinism and Lutheranism, [faustus] 

In Poland-Lithuania, Bohemia, and Hungary Calvinism appealed to a wide 
section of the landed gentry. In some parts, such as Transylvania or the Duchy of 
Cieszyn, its presence proved durable. The Hungarian city of Debrecen has been 
'the Calvinist Rome' ever since. In Lithuania it claimed the allegiance of many 
magnates, including Europe's largest landowners-the Radziwills. 

The effects of Protestantism can be observed in every sphere of European 
life. By emphasizing the necessity of Bible-reading, it made a major impact on 
education in the Protestant countries, and hence on popular literacy. In the 
economic sphere it made a major contribution to enterprise culture, and hence to 
the rise of capitalism. In politics it proved a major bone of contention both 
between states and between rival groupings within states. By dividing the 
Catholic world in two, it spurred the Roman Church into the Reform which it 
had repeatedly postponed. Above all, it dealt a fatal blow to the ideal of a united 
Christendom. Until the 1530s, Christendom had been split into two halves- 
Orthodox and Catholic. From the 1530s onwards it was split into three: 
Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant. And the Protestants themselves were split 
into ever more rival factions. The scandal was so great, and the fragmentation 
was so widespread, that people stopped talking about Christendom, and began to 
talk instead about 'Europe'. 



FAUSTUS 


The real-life 'Dr Faustus' was a vagabond mountebank and fairground 
conjurer, who died at Staufen in Breisgau in 1541. Supposedly a graduate of 
Cracow like Copernicus, he frequented numerous German universities, 
presenting himself as Magister Georgius Sabellicus Faustus Junior. He 
became notorious for his blasphemies, for his 'miracles' such as changing 
water into wine, and for his claim to be in league with the Devil. His exploits 
inspired a stream of so-called Faustbuchs. The first of them, compiled at 
Frankfurt in 1587, was translated into Danish in 1588, into French and Dutch 
in 1592, into English before 1594, and into Czech in 1602. 

As a fictional figure, Faust made his debut in 1594 in the play by 
Christopher Marlowe, where he appears as a man of overweening ambition, 
striving to become 'great Emperor of the world'. He enjoys a season of 
power before the Devil reclaims his own. In Germany he featured in a lost 
drama by Lessing, and in a novel by F. M. Klinger (1791), before being 
adopted as the central protagonist of Goethe's two-part verse tragedy (1808, 
1832). Ferruccio Busoni's opera, Doktor Faust (1916) remained unfinished. 

Goethe's Faust defies easy summary. Faust's pact with Mephisto 
promises him rejuvenation, and he lives to be a hundred. Gib meine Jugend 
mir zuriick! In Part I, which deals with the 'smaller world' of private 
emotion, Faust wrestles with the conflict between his duty to the Devil and 
his love for Gretchen. In Part II, which treats the grosse Welt of society and 
politics, he is the minister of a wastrel Emperor. When he dies, Gretchen 
intervenes, and the Devil is cheated; Heavenly choirs greet the progress of a 
redeemed soul, as Love triumphs: 

Der friih Geliebte, 

Nicht mehrGetrubt, 

Er kommt zuriick! 

(The beloved of long ago, no more befogged, is coming back!) 1 

Goethe's masterpiece inspired two operas, by Gounod and Berlioz, and 
the Faust Symphony (1857) by Liszt. In more recent times, Thomas Mann's 
novel Doktor Faustus (1947) revived the legend for a grim judgement on 
contemporary Germany. A musician, Adrian Leverkiihn, seduced by the 



works of Wagner and Nietzsche, contracts the diabolical curse of syphilis 
from a femme fatale, and expires after composing a nihilistic cantata, D. 
Fausti Weheklag. At its close, a sustained diminuendo from a solo cello 
recalls 'the light in the night', hinting that German civilization may not, after 
all, engender total despair. 2 


The Counter-Reformation was given its name by Protestant historians who 
assumed that it was born to oppose the Protestant Reformation. Catholic 
historians see it differently, as the second stage of a movement for Church 
reform which had a continuous history from the conciliarists of the late 
fourteenth century to the Council of Trent. One must stress, however, that the 
Counter-Reformation was not some sort of autarkic historical engine operating 
in isolation. Like the Renaissance and the Reformation, it interacted with all the 
other great phenomena of the age. 

The paralysis reigning at the centre of the Catholic Church eased during the 
pontificate of Paul III (Alessandro Farnese, 1534-49). Known as 'Cardinal 
Petticoat', Paul III was a flagrant nepotist, brother of a papal concubine, and the 
lavish patron of Michelangelo and Titian. At the same time he saw the urgency 
of change. He revitalized the Sacred College, commissioned the key inquiry into 
Church reform, Consilium de emendanda ecclesia (1537), patronized the Jesuits, 
established the Holy Office, and launched the Council of Trent. Until the 1530s 
the Sacred College of Cardinals, which elected the Popes, was one of the 
Church's weaker pillars. But with its budget cut, and its numbers increased by 
several brilliant appointments, it became the Vatican's power-house for change. 
Its outstanding names included Cardinals Caraffa (later Paul IV, 1555-9), 
Cervini (later Marcellus II, 1555), and the Englishman Reginald Pole, who 
missed election in 1550 by one vote. The next run of popes was of a different 
stamp. Pius IV (1559-65) did not hesitate to condemn to death the criminal 
nephews of his predecessor. The austere and fanatical Pius V (1566-72), 
sometime Inquisitor-General who walked barefoot in Rome, was later canonized. 
Gregory XIII (1572-85), who rejoiced at the massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve, 
was wholly political. 

The Society of Jesus has been called the corps d'elite of Catholic Reform. It 
combined the fierce piety and military lifestyle of its Basque founder, Inigo 
Lopez de Recalde (St Ignatius Loyola, 1491-1556), author of the Spiritual 




Exercises (1523). Approved in 1540 by Paul Ill's Bull Regimini Militantis 
Ecclesiae, it operated under direct papal command. Its members were organized 
in ranks under their General, and were trained to think of themselves as 
'companions of Jesus'. Their aims were to convert the heathen, to reconvert the 
lapsed, and, above all, to educate. Within a few decades of their formation, their 
missionaries appeared all over the world from Mexico to Japan. Their colleges 
sprang up in every corner of Catholic Europe, from Braganza to Kiev. 'I have 
never left the Army,' said St Ignatius; 'I have only been seconded to the service 
of God.' And elsewhere: 'Give me a boy at the age of seven, and he will be mine 
for ever.' At his canonization it was said, 'Ignatius had a heart large enough to 
hold the universe.'- 

Despite their successes, the Jesuits aroused immense fear and resentment, 
among Catholics as well as Protestants. They were famed for their casuistry in 
dispute, and were widely thought to hold that 'the end justifies the means'. They 
came to be seen as the Church's secret thought police, accountable to no one. 
Already in 1612 the forged Monita Secreta, published in Cracow, purported to 
reveal the instructions of their worldwide conspiracy under the formidable 
General Acquaviva, 'the Black Pope'. The Society was suppressed in 1773 but 
restored in 1814. 

The Holy Office was established in 1542 as the supreme court of appeal in 
matters of heresy. Staffed by leading cardinals, it assumed supervision of the 
Inquisition and in 1557 issued the first Index, the list of prohibited books. In 
1588 it became one of the nine reorganized Congregations, or executive 
departments of the Roman Curia. It worked alongside the Office for the 
Propagation of the Faith, which was charged with converting the heathen and 
heretics, [index] [inquisitio] [propaganda] 

The Council of Trent, which met in three sessions, 1545-7,1551-2, and 
1562-3, was the General Council for which Church reformers had been praying 
for decades. It provided the doctrinal definitions and the institutional structures 
which enabled the Roman Church to revive and to meet the Protestant challenge. 
Its decrees on doctrine were largely conservative. It confirmed that the Church 
alone could interpret the Scriptures, and that religious truth derived from 
Catholic tradition as well as from the Bible. It upheld traditional views of 
original sin, justification, and merit, and rejected the various Protestant 
alternatives to transubstantiation during the Eucharist. Its decrees on 
organization reformed the Church orders, regularized the appointment of 


bishops, and established seminaries in every diocese. Its decrees on the form of 
the Mass, contained in a new Catechism and a revised Breviary, affected the 
lives of ordinary Catholics most directly. After 1563 the same Latin Tridentine 
Mass could be heard in most Roman Catholic churches throughout the world. 

Critics of the Council of Trent point to its neglect of practical ethics, its 
failure to give Catholics a moral code to match that of the Protestants. Tt 
impressed on the Church the stamp of an intolerant age/ wrote an English 
Catholic, 'and perpetuated ... the spirit of an austere immorality/- The 
Protestant historian Ranke stressed the paradox of a Council which had intended 
to trim the Papacy. Instead, by oaths of loyalty, detailed regulations, and 
punishments, the entire Catholic hierarchy was subordinated to the Pope. 
'Discipline was restored, but all the faculties of directing it were centred in 
Rome/- Several Catholic monarchs, including Philip II of Spain, so feared the 
Tridentine decrees that they curtailed their publication. 

The particular religious ethos promoted by the Counter-Reformation 
emphasized the discipline and collective life of the faithful. It reflected the wide 
powers of enforcement given to the hierarchy, and the outward show of 
conformity which believers were now required to display. It insisted on regular 
confession as a sign of submission. It was supported by a wide range of 
communal practices-pilgrimages, ceremonies, and processions-and by the 
calculated theatricality of the accompanying art, architecture, and music. 
Catholic propaganda of this vintage was strong both on rational argument, and 
on devices for impressing the senses. The Baroque churches of the era, crammed 
with altars, columns, statues, cherubs, gold leaf, icons, monstrances, candelabra, 
and incense, were designed to leave nothing to the private thoughts of the 
congregation. Unlike the Protestant preachers, who stressed individual 
conscience and individual probity, ah too often the Catholic clergy seemed to 
urge their flock to blind obedience. 


INQUISITIO 


Sixteenth-century Seville. Jesus Christ has returned to earth, and has 
been caught performing miracles. He is promptly arrested. The Grand 





Inquisitor conducts the prisoner's interrogation in person. 'Why have you 
come to meddle with us?' he asks. And answer received he none. 

Among many recriminations, the Inquisitor accuses Christ of misleading 
people with the gift of Free Will. Man is by nature a rebel and given the 
choice will always choose the path to damnation. For their own good, he 
implies, people must be denied their freedom in order to save their souls. 
'Did you forget that a tranquil mind, and a tranquil death, is dearer to Man 
than freedom in the knowledge of Good and Evil?' 

Moreover, the Inquisitor claims, the facts of History support his case. 
People are too weak to resist temptation. For 1,500 years, they have 
wallowed in sin and suffering, incapable of heeding Christ's behests. 'You 
promised them bread from Heaven, but can it compare with earthly bread in 
the eyes of the weak, vicious, and always ignoble race of men? We are more 
humane than you.' 

The Inquisitor charges that Christ did not rebut the Devil's challenge, 
and did not give proof of his Divinity. He failed the threefold test on 
Mystery, Miracle, and Authority. The Papacy, in fact, is secretly on the 
Devil's side. 'We have been with him, and not with you,' the Inquisitor 
reveals, referring to the Catholic-Orthodox Schism, 'for eight centuries'. 

The Inquisitor bitterly foretells the victory of faithless materialism. 'Do 
you know that centuries will pass, and mankind will proclaim ... that there is 
no crime, and therefore no sin, and only starving people? "Feed them first, 
and then demand virtue!" That's what will be written on the banners with 
which they will destroy your temple.' 

In the Inquisitor's dungeon, the conclusion seems inevitable.'You have 
been disgorged from Hell', he tells Christ; 'You are a heretic. Tomorrow I 
shall burn you!' 

At the last moment, Christian forgiveness triumphs. Christ kisses the 
Inquisitor on the cheek. Overcome by the power of love, the Inquisitor 
relents, and the prison gate is opened.... 

Such a summary might serve as introductory student notes on 'The 
Legend of the Grand Inquisitor'. The creator of 'The Legend' was a young 
Russian author, Ivan Karamazov, who lived with his father and brothers in 
the 1860s. The Karamazovs' own saga, like the 'Legend', which forms one 
of its central episodes, poses the eternal questions of Good and Evil. Father 



Karamazov is a nasty debauchee, against whom the elder son, Dmitri, has 
already rebelled. Ivan and Aloysha, Dmitri's half-brothers, are respectively 
the sceptical atheist and the trusting optimist. But it is the fourth, bastard 
son, Smyerdyakov or 'Stinker', who kills the Father before killing himself. 
At the trial, Ivan is racked by guilt for inciting the deed, and tries to take the 
blame. But in an atrocious miscarriage of justice, the innocent Dmitri is 
condemned. In a final scene, the family's children show their elders how to 
live in harmony. 1 

The creator of The Brothers Karamazov (1880) was Feodor 
Dostoyevsky. 2 In it, he re-worked many of the themes and insights of a 
lifetime's writing. In the view of Sigmund Freud, it is 'the most magnificent 
novel ever written.' About the Creator of Dostoyevsky, Dostoyevsky had no 
doubts. 

Dostoyevsky invented the Grand Inquisitor's Legend as the vehicle for 
European literature's most penetrating critique of the Christian Church. In it, 
he presages the moral objections to totalitarianism. He imagines a fictional 
event. It well illustrates the author's prejudices against Catholicism, but also 
his belief in the essential unity of Christendom. 

On the surface, Dostoyevsky was a Russian chauvinist. He disliked 
'merciless' Jews; he despised Catholics, especially Poles, whom he often 
portrayed as criminals; and he hated socialists. He took the Russian 
Orthodox Church to be what its name proclaimed-the only True Faith. 'In 
the West there is no longer any Christianity', he ranted; 'Catholicism is 
transforming itself into idolatry, whilst Protestantism is rapidly changing into 
atheism and to variable ethics.' 3 Allegedly, his formula was: 'Catholicism = 
Unity without Freedom. Protestantism = Freedom without Unity; Orthodoxy 
= Freedom in Unity, Unity in Freedom.' 

Many critics consider that Dostoyevsky put the Inquisitor's arguments 
more forcefully than Christ's. In the confrontation between Church and 
Faith, the Faith appears to lose. This was probably his intention, since he 
rated logic far lower than belief. 'Even if it were proved to me that Christ 
were outside the Truth', he once wrote, 'I would still stay with Christ.' 4 

Dostoyevsky's critique of the West was unremitting (which may explain 
his star rating among Western intellectuals). Yet he saw the division of 
Christendom as an instance of the Evil which would ultimately be overcome. 
He believed fervently that evil could be conquered. Sin and suffering 



precede redemption. The scandals of the Church were a necessary prelude to 
Christian harmony. By this reasoning, the horrors of the Spanish Inquisition 
were an indication of Christianity's ultimate triumph. In his heart of hearts, 
the old reactionary was a universal Christian, and, in the spiritual sense, a 
devout European. 

Above all, Dostoyevsky believed in the healing power of faith. On the 
title-page of The Brothers Karamazov, he added the verse 'Verily, verily, I 
say unto you, except a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth 
alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.' 5 Those same words were 
carved on his tombstone. 


PROPAGANDA 

Propaganda is the child of conflicting belief, and of people's determination 
to spread their own doctrines against all others. Its origins undoubtedly lay 
in the religious sphere. It is in essence biased, being most successful when it 
appeals to hatred and prejudice. It is the antithesis of all honest education 
and information. 

To be most effective, propaganda needs the help of censorship. Within a 
sealed informational arena, it can mobilize all means of communication- 
printed, spoken, artistic, and visual-and press its claims to maximum 
advantage. To this end, the Roman Officium de Propaganda Fidei, from 
which the term derives, worked alongside the Inquisition. It became one of 
the Vatican's permanent congregations in 1622. 

Propaganda was no less prevalent in Protestant and Orthodox countries, 
where the Churches were subordinated to state power. Political propaganda, 
too, had always existed, though without the name. It was boosted by 
printing, and later by newspapers and broadsheets. It was most in evidence 
in wartime, especially during civil and religious wars. During the 1790s, 
French soldiers were given to appearing in the enemy camp armed only with 
leaflets. 




In the twentieth century, the scope for propaganda was dramatically 
expanded by the advent of new media, such as film, radio, and TV; by the 
techniques of marketing, mass persuasion, commercial advertising, and 
'PR'; by the appearance of Utopian ideologies; and by the ruthlessness of the 
totalitarian state. 'Total propaganda' and the art of 'the Big Lie' was 
pioneered by the Bolsheviks. Lenin, after Plekhanov, distinguished between 
the high-powered propagandist, who devised the strategy, and the low-level 
agitator, who put it into practice. Where Soviet agitprop led, the Fascists 
were quick to follow. 

Theorists of propaganda have identified five basic rules: 

1. The mle of simplification: reducing all data to a simple confrontation 
between 'Good and Bad', 'Friend and Foe'. 

2. The rule of disfiguration: discrediting the opposition by crude smears and 
parodies. 

3. The rule of transfusion: manipulating the consensus values of the target 
audience for one's own ends. 

4. The rule of unanimity: presenting one's viewpoint as if it were the 
unanimous opinion of all right-thinking people: drawing the doubting 
individual into agreement by the appeal of star-performers, by social 
pressure, and by 'psychological contagion'. 

5. The rule of orchestration: endlessly repeating the same messages in 
different variations and combinations. 

In this regard, one of the supreme masters acknowledged his antecedents. 
'The Catholic Church keeps going', said Dr Goebbels, 'because it has been 
repeating the same thing for two thousand years. The National Socialist 
Party must do likewise.' 1 

One of the more insidious forms of propaganda, however, is that where 
the true sources of information are hidden from recipients and propagators 
alike. This genre of so-called 'covertly directed propaganda' aims to 
mobilize a network of unsuspecting 'agents of influence' who pass on the 
desired message as if they were acting spontaneously. By feigning a 
coincidence of views with those of the target society, which it seeks to 
subvert, and by pandering to the proclivities of key individuals, it can suborn 
a dominant elite of opinion-makers by stealth. 



Such, it seems, was the chosen method of Stalin's propaganda chiefs 
who spun their webs among the cultural circles of leading Western countries 
from the 1920s onwards. The chief controller in the field was an apparently 
harmless German Communist, an erstwhile colleague of Lenin in 
Switzerland and sometime acquaintance of Dr Goebbels in the Reichstag, 
Willi Munzenberg (1889-1940). Working alongside Soviet spies, he 
perfected the art of doing secret business in the open. He set the agenda of a 
series of campaigns against 'Anti-militarism', 'Anti-imperialism', and above 
all 'Anti-fascism', homing in on a handful of receptive milieux in Berlin, 
Paris, and London. His principal dupes and recruits, dubbed 'fellow- 
travellers' by the sceptics, rarely joined the Communist Party and would 
indignantly deny being manipulated. They included writers, artists, editors, 
left-wing publishers, and carefully selected celebrities-hence Romain 
Rolland, Louis Aragon, Andre Malraux, Heinrich Mann, Berthold Brecht, 
Anthony Blunt, Harold Laski, Claud Cockburn, Sidney and Beatrice Webb, 
and half the Bloomsbury Set. Since all attracted strings of acolytes, dubbed 
'Innocents' Clubs', they achieved a ripple effect that was aptly called 'rabbit 
breeding'. The ultimate goal has been nicely defined; 'to create for the right- 
thinking, non-communist West the dominating political prejudice of the era: 
the belief that any opinion that happened to serve ... the Soviet Union was 
derived from the most essential elements of human decency.' 2 

Such cynicism has few parallels. It can be judged by the fate which the 
Great Leader reserved for all his most devoted propagandists such as Karol 
Radek, and probably Munzenberg himself, who was found mysteriously 
hanged in the French mountains. Brecht's comment on Stalin's victims was 
less of a joke than he thought. 'The more innocent they are', he wrote, 'the 
more they deserve to be shot'. 3 


The Counter-Reformation saw a plentiful harvest of Catholic saints. There 
were the Spanish mystics: St Teresa of Avila (1515-82) and St John of the Cross 
(1542-91); there was a long line of servants of the sick and the poor: St Philip 
Neri (1515-95), St Camillo de Lellis (1550-1614), St Vincent de Paul (1576- 
1660), St Louise de Marillac (1591-1660); and there were the Jesuit saints and 
martyrs: St Francis Xavier (1506-52), St Stanislaw Kostka (1550-68), St 
Aloysius Gonzaga (1568-91), St Peter Canisius (1521-97), St John Berchmans 




(1599-1621), and St Robert Bellarmine (1542-1621). They won back much lost 
ground. 

The impact of the Counter-Reformation was felt right across Europe. 
Traditional support for the Church was strongest in Italy and Spain, but pockets 
of nonconformity had to be smoked out even there. The Spanish Netherlands, 
trapped between France and the United Provinces, were turned into a hotbed of 
Catholic militancy in which the University of Louvain (Leuven) and the Jesuit 
College at Douai took the lead. Yet an important reaction against the prevailing 
zeal was provoked by Cornelius Jansen (1585-1638), Bishop of Ypres and a 
fervent critic of the Jesuits. In his digest of the works of St Augustine, the 
Augustinus (1640), Jansen attacked what he took to be the theological casuistry 
and superficial morality of his day, placing special emphasis on the believer's 
need for Divine Grace and for spiritual rebirth. Though he never wavered in his 
loyalty to Rome, and rejected the Protestant doctrine of justification by faith, 
several of his propositions on the issue of Divine Grace approached the 
Protestant standpoint, and were duly condemned as such. (See Chapter VIII.) 

Switzerland was rent by the hostility of the Catholic and the Protestant 
cantons. The doctrines of Zurich and Geneva penetrated many of the alpine 
villages of the surrounding regions. They were eradicated by violent means on 
the Italian border by St Charles Borromeo, Cardinal-Archbishop of Milan 
(1538-84), and contested in Savoy by the more gentle persuasion of St Francis 
de Sales (1567-1622), author of the bestselling Introduction to the Devout Life 
(1609). [MENOCCHI] 

In France, many Catholics stood aloof from the new militancy, partly in line 
with the Gallican tradition and the Concordat of 1516, and partly from France's 
hostility to the Habsburgs. But a pro-Roman 'ultramontane' party grew in 
prominence round the faction of the Guises. Their darkest deed was committed 
at the massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve on 23 August 1572, when 2,000 
Huguenots were butchered in Paris-after which the Pope celebrated a Te Deum 
and the King of Spain 'began to laugh'. In the seventeenth century Jansenism 
offered a middle way, an antidote to the partisanship of contending ultras and 
Huguenots. 


MENOCCHI 




in 1599 a simple miller from Montereale in Friuli, Comenico Scandella, I 
was burned at the stake for heresy, just two years before Giordano Bruno 
suffered the same penalty in Rome. The papers of his case, which have 
survived at Udine, open the world of unconventional belief which historians 
penetrate with difficulty. After two trials, long interrogation, imprisonment, 
and torture, the Holy Inquisition insisted that he had denied 'the virginity of 
the Blessed Virgin, the divinity of Christ, and the Providence of God'. 

Known as 'Menocchio', the miller of Montereale, sometime village 
mayor, was father of eleven children, a rampant gossip, an outspoken 
anticleric, and a voracious reader. When he was arrested, his house 
contained: 

a vernacular Italian Bible; 

// Fioretto della Bibbia (a Catalan biblical anthology in translation); 

// Rosario della Madonna by Alberto da Castello, OP; 

A translation of the Legenda Aurea, 'the Golden Legend'; 

Historia del Giudicio, in fifteenth-century rhyme; 

// Cavalier Zuanne de Mandavilla (a translation of Sir John 
Mandeville's Travels); 

II Sogno di Caravia (Venice, 1541); 

// Supplemento delle Cronache (a version of Foesti's chronicle); 

Lunario al Modo di Italia (an almanac); 

an unexpurgated edition of Boccaccio's Decameron; 

an unnamed book, identified by a witness as the Koran. 

Menocchio had talked at length with one Simon the Jew, was interested in 
Lutheranism, and would not admit the biblical Creation story. Echoing 
Dante 1 and numerous ancient myths, he insisted that the angels were 
produced by nature 'just as worms are produced from cheese'. 2 


The Kingdom of England was targeted for reconversion in a campaign that 
spawned the Forty Catholic martyrs led by St Edmund Campion SJ (1540-81) 




and many other victims. Ireland was confirmed in its Catholicism, especially 
after the brutal Elizabethan expedition of 1598. But religious unity in Ireland 
was shattered by the planting of a Scottish Presbyterian colony in Ulster in 1611, 
and by the Anglican inclinations of the Anglo-Irish gentry. 

In the lands of the Austrian Habsburgs, the Counter-Reformation became 
inextricably confused with the dynasty and its politics. Indeed, that special brand 
of Catholicism, the pietas austriaca, which emerged at the turn of the 
seventeenth century became the prime ingredient of a wide cultural community 
that has outlived Habsburg rule. It was once called 'Confessional Absolutism'. 
The Collegium Germanicum in Rome played a strategic role. The Jesuits took an 
unrivalled hold over education in Vienna and Prague through the efforts of the 
Dutchman, Canisius. Western Hungary, Slovakia, Croatia, Silesia, Bohemia, and, 
at a later date, western Galicia all belonged to this same sphere. Baroque culture, 
it has been argued, represented the ivy which not only covered the ramshackle 
Habsburg edifice but helped to hold it together (see p. 529). 

Elsewhere in Germany, an uneasy modus vivendi between Catholics and 
Protestants had been reached in 1555 at the Peace of Augsburg: each prince was 
to decide on the religion of his subjects; Lutheranism was to be the only 
Protestant denomination allowed; Lutherans living in Catholic states were to be 
tolerated. Germany was turned into a religious patchwork where, however, the 
Catholic princes and emperors, feared a further Protestant advance. As from the 
1550s, 'Spanish priests' set up Jesuit centres at Cologne, Mainz, Ingolstadt, and 
Munich, creating durable Catholic bastions in the Rhineland and Bavaria. 
Calvinist enclaves, in the Palatinate and Saxony and elsewhere, were not secured 
until the second half of the century. In December 1607 the Duke of Bavaria 
provocatively seized the city of Donauworth in Swabia in order to stop 
Protestant interference with Catholic processions. Ten Protestant princes thereon 
convened an Evangelical Union to defend their interests, only to be confronted 
by the rival activities of a Catholic League. It is difficult to say, therefore, 
whether the outbreak of the Thirty Years War occurred in 1618 or beforehand. 

In this world of growing religious intolerance, Poland-Lithuania occupied a 
place apart. A vast territory with a very varied population, it had contained a 
mosaic of the Catholic, Orthodox, Judaic, and Muslim faiths even before 
Lutheranism claimed the cities of Polish Prussia or Calvinism a sizeable section 
of the nobility. Such was the position of the ruling szlachta that every manor 
could run its religious affairs with the same liberty as German princedoms. Prom 



1565 the verdicts of ecclesiastical courts could not be enforced on the private 
estates of noblemen. At the very time that Cardinal Hozjusz, President of the 
Council of Trent and Bishop of Warmia, was introducing the Jesuits, Poland was 
receiving all manner of heretics and religious refugees-English and Scottish 
Catholics, Czech Brethren, Anabaptists from Holland, or, like Faustus Sozzini 
(Socinius), Italian Unitarians. In 1573, with Calvinists commanding a majority 
in the Senate, the Polish parliament passed a statute of permanent and universal 
toleration, from which only the Socinians were excepted. Under Sigismund III 
Vasa (r. 1587-1632), a fervent pupil of the Jesuits, the ultramontane party 
gradually reasserted the Catholic supremacy. But progress was slow; and non¬ 
violent methods alone were available. In this period Poland could rightly boast 
of its role both as the bulwark of Christendom against Turk and Tartar and as 
Europe's prime haven of toleration. 

Elsewhere in Eastern Europe the Counter-Reformation reverberated far and 
wide. The Vatican, under Gregory XIII (1572-85), entertained hopes of netting 
not only Sweden and Poland but even Muscovy. In Sweden those hopes 
remained high until the victory of the Protestants in the civil war of the 1590s 
dashed Jesuit plans for good. In Moscow the papal nuncio Possevino was 
received by Ivan the Terrible, only to find that the Tsar's main interest in 
Catholicism lay in the workings of the papal litter. Clumsy pressure from the 
Catholic side probably pushed Ivan's son, Fedor, into creating the Moscow 
Patriarchate in 1589, thereby finalizing the emergence of the separate Russian 
Orthodox Church. 

Moscow's demarche provoked a crisis among the Orthodox in neighbouring 
Poland-Lithuania, who till then had always looked to the Patriarch of 
Constantinople. With the new Muscovite Patriarch claiming jurisdiction over 
them from across the frontier, many of those Orthodox now sought the 
protection of Rome. In 1596, at the Union of Brest, the majority of their bishops 
chose to found a new Uniate communion-the Greek Catholic Church of Slavic 
Rite. They retained their ritual, and their married clergy, whilst admitting the 
supremacy of the Pope. Most of the Orthodox churches in Byelorussia and 
Ukraine, including the ancient cathedral of St Sophia in Kiev, passed into the 
hands of the Uniates. For a time the old 'disuniate' remnant was officially 
banned by the state. 

Moscow, however, was never reconciled to these developments. The furious 
determination of the Russian Orthodox Church to punish and forcibly to 



reconvert the Uniates remained constant throughout modern history. Nowhere 
has the stereotype of the dastardly, scheming Jesuit remained stronger. The 
Russo-Polish wars, when in 1610-12 the Poles briefly occupied the Kremlin, 
only served to cement the religious hatreds. On the great Russian monastery at 
Zagorsk near Moscow, a commemorative tablet underlines the popular Russian 
view of the Counter-Reformation: 'Typhus-Tartars-Poles: Three Plagues'. 

In Hungary, a similar Uniate communion emerged from the Union of 
Uzhgorod (1646). In this case, the Orthodox Ruthenes of the sub-Carpathian 
region chose to seek union with Rome along the lines adopted in neighbouring 
Ukraine. (Their decision was still causing ructions between Roman Catholic and 
Uniate Ruthenes in the USA in the 1920s.) 

All over Europe, religious fervour profoundly affected the progress of the 
arts. The more severe forms of Protestantism questioned the very propriety of 
artistic endeavour. The plastic arts were often channelled into secular subjects, 
since religious subjects had become suspect. In some countries, such as Holland 
or Scotland, music was reduced to hymn-singing and metrical psalms. In 
England, in contrast, Thomas Tallis (c. 1505-85) and others launched the 
wonderful tradition of Anglican cathedral music. In the Catholic countries, all 
branches of the arts were exposed to demands for sumptuous and theatrical 
displays of the Church's glory and power. The trend is known as 'Baroque'. In 
music, it was associated with the names of Jan Peterzoon Sweelinck (1562- 
1621), of Heinrich Schutz (1585-1672), and above all of Giovanni Palestrina 
(1526-94), magister capellae at St Peter's, whose ninety-four extant masses 
reveal huge variety and inventiveness. Claudio Monteverdi (1567-1643), 
pioneer of monody as opposed to polyphony, rediscoverer of dissonance, and 
proponent of Italy's 'New Music', occupies a special place in the evolution of 
Europe's secular music. He was largely employed in Venice, as always a 
counterpoint to the arts of Rome. Baroque painting was dominated by 
Michelangelo Caravaggio (1573-1610), a pardoned murderer; by the Fleming 
Paul Rubens (1577-1640), and by the Spaniard Diego Velazquez (1599-1660). 
In architecture, the ubiquitous Baroque churches were often modelled on the 
Jesuit GesU Church (1575) in Rome. 

Religious fervour came to the fore in the wars of the sixteenth and 
seventeenth centuries. Passions and hatreds once reserved for the campaigns 
against Islam now fired the conflicts between Christians. Protestant fears of 
Catholic domination surfaced in the Wars of the Schmalkaldic League in 



Germany, 1531-48, which ended with the Peace of Augsburg; in the French 
Wars of Religion, 1562-98; in the Swedish civil war, 1598-1604; in the Thirty 
Years War, 1618-48. Catholic fears of Protestant domination inspired many 
episodes such as the Pilgrimage of Grace (1536) in England, Irish resistance to 
Mountjoy and Cromwell, Polish resistance to the Swedes in 1655-60. In the 
East, the extended campaigns between Russians and Poles-1561-5,1578- 
82,1610-19,1632-4,1654-67-took on all the trappings of a Holy War between 
Catholic and Orthodox. Religious fanaticism could be made to inspire armies. In 
the sixteenth century the invincible Spaniards were taught to believe that they 
were fighting for the only true faith. In the seventeenth century the psalm¬ 
singing troopers of Gustavus Adolphus, or of Cromwell's marvellous New 
Model Army, were taught exactly the same. 

The French Wars of Religion were spectacularly un-Christian. Persecution of 
the Huguenots had begun with the chambre ardente under Henri II. But the 
King's sudden death in 1559, and that of the Duke of Anjou, provoked 
prolonged uncertainty about the succession, [Nostradamus] This in turn 
enflamed the ambitions of the Catholic faction led by the Guises, and of the 
Bourbon-Huguenot faction led by the Kings of Navarre. A vain attempt at 
religious reconciliation at the Colloquy of Passy (1561) was bracketed by two 
violent provocations-one by the Protestants at Amboise in 1560 and the second 
by the Catholics at Vassy in 1562. Thereafter the rival factions set at each other's 
throats with a will, fanned by the schemes of the Queen Mother, Catherine de' 
Medici. The massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve was but the largest of the series. 
Vicious skirmishing reminiscent of the earlier English wars produced few set 
battles, but plenty of opportunity for the dashing adventurers such as the 
Protestant Baron d'Adrets or the Catholic Blaise de Montluc. Eight wars in thirty 
years were peppered with broken truces and foul murders. In the 1580s, such 
was the power of the Guises' Holy League, intent alike on suppressing toleration 
and on reining in the homosexual king, that the latter ordered the assassination of 
the Duke and Cardinal de Guise (1588). (Their father, Francois de Guise, the 
famous general, had been murdered at Orleans in 1563.) In response, on 1 
August 1589 at St Cloud, the King himself was assassinated by a furious monk, 
Jacques Clement. This left Henri of Navarre as sole contender for the throne. 
When the Catholic clergy refused to anoint a lapsed heretic, he cynically 
undertook to reconvert; he was crowned at Chartres in 1594 and entered Paris in 
triumph. Paris vaut bien une messe (Paris is well worth a Mass) sums up the 
moral tone. The resultant Edict of Nantes (1598) was no better. Having fought 



all his life in the name of religious liberty, Henri IV now undertook to limit 
toleration of the Huguenots to aristo-cratic houses, to two churches per district, 
and to 120 named strongholds. Intense fears and suspicions remained. 

Given the persistence of religious pluralism in Britain, France, the 
Netherlands, and Poland-Lithuania, it is erroneous to view Europe in this period 
in terms of a simple division between the 'Protestant North' and the 'Catholic 
South'. The Irish, the Belgians, and the Poles, among others, have every right to 
insist that the North was not uniformly Protestant. Both Orthodox Christians and 
Muslims have good reason to object to the South being classified as uniformly 
Catholic. The Protestant-Catholic divide was an important feature of Central 
Europe, and of Germany in particular. But it cannot be applied with any 
precision to the Continent as a whole. Attempts by Marx or Weber to correlate it 
with later divisions based on social or economic criteria would seem to be 
Germanocentric to a fault. One might as well ask why the Protestant God was so 
successful in endowing his followers with coalfields. 

One thing was clear. Senseless bloodletting in the name of religion inevitably 
sparked off a reaction in the minds of intelligent people. The Wars of Religion 
offered fertile soil for the fragile seeds of reason and science. 

The Scientific Revolution, which is generally held to have taken place between 
the mid-sixteenth and the mid-seventeenth centuries, has been called 'the most 
important event in European History since the rise of Christianity' .- It followed 
a natural progression from Renaissance humanism, and was assisted to some 
extent by Protestant attitudes. Its forte lay in astronomy, and in those sciences 
such as mathematics, optics, and physics which were needed to collect and to 
interpret astronomical data. But it changed mankind's view both of human nature 
and the human predicament. It began with observations made on the tower of the 
capitular church of Frombork (Frauenburg) in Polish Prussia in the second 
decade of the sixteenth century; and it culminated at a meeting of the Royal 
Society at Gresham College in London on 28 April 1686. 

The difficulty with the Scientific Revolution, as with any fundamental shift 
in human thought, lies in the fact that its precepts did not accord with prevailing 
ideas and practices. The so-called 'age of Copernicus, Bacon and Galileo' is a 
misnomer: in most respects this was still the age of the alchemists, the 
astrologers, and the magicians. Nor should modern historians mock the 
achievements of those whose theories were eventually proved mistaken. It is fair 


to say that the alchemists misunderstood the nature of matter. It is not fair to say 
that researchers who have seen the constructive aspects of alchemy are 'tinctured 
by the lunacy which they try to describe'. It would be hard to find a more 
'whiggish interpretation' of scientific history.- 

Mikolaj Kopernik (Copernicus, 1473-1543), who had studied both at 
Cracow and at Padua, established that the Sun, not the Earth, lay at the centre of 
the solar system. His heliocentric ideas coincided with the common astrological 
habit of using the sun as the symbol of unity. But the point is: he proved the 
hypothesis by detailed experiments and measurements. Son of a German 
merchant family from Thorn (Torn) and a loyal subject of the King of Poland, 
whom he had actively defended against the Teutonic Knights, he lived for thirty 
years in Frombork as a canon of the province of Warmia (Ermeland). He was 
employed by the King in the pursuit of monetary reform; and his treatise 
Monetae cudendae ratio (1526), about 'bad money driving out good', 
expounded Gresham's Law thirty years before Gresham. His theory of 
heliocentrism, first advanced in 1510, was fully supported with statistical data in 
De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Celestial 
Spheres, 1543). It was published on the initiative of a mathematical colleague 
from Lutheran Wittenberg, G. J. von Lauchen (Rheticus), dedicated to Pope Paul 
III, and delivered to its author on his deathbed. At a stroke it overturned reigning 
conceptions of the universe, dashing the Aristotelian ideas about a central, 
immobile, and unplanetlike Earth. Its immediate impact was much reduced 
because a fearful editor replaced Copernicus's introduction with a misleading 
preface of his own. 

The Copernican theory gestated for almost a century. The Dane Tycho Brahe 
(1546-1601) rejected heliocentrism; but through observing the pathways of 
comets he destroyed another ancient misconception, namely that the cosmos 
consists of onion-like crystalline spheres. Brahe's colleague in Prague, Johann 
Kepler (1571-1630), established the elliptical shape of planetary orbits, and 
enunciated the laws of motion underlying Copernicus. But it was the Florentine, 
Galileo Galilei (1564-1642), one of the first to avail himself of the newly 
invented telescope, who really brought Copernicus to the wider public. 
Fortunately for posterity, Galileo was as rash as he was perceptive. Having 
discovered that 'the moon is not smooth or uniform, but rough and full of 
cavities, like the earth', he exploded the prevailing theory of 'perfect spheres'. 
Moreover, he defended his findings with scathing comments on his opponents' 
biblical references. 'The astronomical language of the Bible', he suggested to the 


dowager Duchess of Tuscany, was 'designed for the comprehension of the 
ignorant'. This, in 1616, earned him a summons to Rome, and a papal 
admonition. And Galileo's praise for Copernicus put Copernicus onto the Index. 
When Galileo persisted, however, and published his Dialogo dei due massimi 
Sistemi del mondo (Dialogue on the two main world systems, 1632), which 
expounded the superiority of Copernicus over Ptolemy, he was formally tried by 
the Inquisition, and forced to recant. His supposed parting comment to the 
inquisitors, Eppur si muove (Yet it does move), is apocryphal, [lesbia] 

Practical science remained in its infancy during the era when the Copernican 
theory was in dispute. Some important assertions were made, however, by the 
sometime Chancellor of England, Francis Bacon (1561-1626), the father of 
scientific method. In his Advancement of Learning (1605), the Novum Organum 
(1620), and the New Atlantis (1627), Bacon stated the proposition that 
knowledge should proceed by orderly and systematic experimentation, and by 
inductions based on experimental data. In this he boldly opposed the traditional 
deductive method, where knowledge could only be established by reference to 
certain accepted axioms sanctioned by the Church. Significantly, Bacon held that 
scientific research must be complementary to the study of the Bible. Science was 
to be kept compatible with Christian theology. 'The scientist became the priest of 
God's Book of Nature.' One of Bacon's ardent followers, John Wilkins (1614- 
72), sometime Bishop of Chester and a founder member of the Royal Society, 
wrote the curious Discovery of a World on the Moon (1638) containing the idea 
of lunar travel: 'The inhabitants of other worlds are redeemed by the same 
means as we are, by the blood of Christ.'- 


LESBIA 

In 1622, in a little-publicized ecclesiastical trial, a Florentine abbess called 
Benedetta Carlini was accused of irregular practices. She had boasted of 
mystical visions; she had claimed to possess the sacred stigmata; and she had 
raised suspicions through some form of sexual offence. She was 
subsequently demoted, and spent forty-five years incarcerated. 

In 1985, amidst much greater publicity, a leading American publisher 
launched an account of the trial under the guise of 'a Lesbian Nun in 





Renaissance Italy'. 1 Unfortunately, the materials of the trial did not quite 
coincide with the implications of the title. The post-Renaissance inquisitors 
had focused on the defendant's religious beliefs. They not only failed to 
emphasize the lurid details of a lesbian 'lifestyle'; they simply were not 
interested. One disappointed reviewer commented that at no time before the 
present century were men capable of comprehending the notion of 
lesbianism. At the same time, 'the apparently oxymoronic term "lesbian 
nun" easily tickles the curiosity ... and guarantees the sale of a certain 
number of books.' 2 

It is indeed the duty of historians to stress the contrast between the 
standards of the past and the standards of the present. Some fulfil that duty 
on purpose, others by accident. 


Important advances, too, were made by philosophers with a mathematical 
bent, notably by the two dazzling Frenchmen, Rene Descartes (1596-1650) and 
Blaise Pascal (1623-62), and their successor, Benedictus Spinoza (1632-77). 
Descartes, a soldier-adventurer who witnessed the Battle of the White Mountain 
(see p. 564), lived much of his life in exile in Holland. He is most associated 
with the uncompromising rationalist system named after him (Cartesianism) and 
elaborated in his Discours sur la methode (1637). Having rejected every piece of 
information which came to him through his senses, or on the authority of others, 
he concluded that he must at least exist if he was capable of thinking: Cogito, 
ergo sum, 'I think, therefore I am', is the launch-pad of modern epistemology. At 
the same time, in a philosophy which divided matter from spirit and which 
delved into everything from medicine to morals, Descartes emphasized the 
mechanistic view of the world which even then was taking hold. Animals, for 
example, were viewed as complex machines, as were human beings. 

Pascal, a native of Clermont-Ferrand and an inmate of the Jansenist Port- 
Royal in Paris, took the mechanical ideal to the point where he was able to 
produce the first 'computer'. His Lettres provinciales (1656) are still quoted in 
Jesuit literature as a cup of poison. Yet his collected Pensees (1670) are a 
delectable blend of the fashionable rationalism and of sound common sense. 'Le 
coeur a ses raisons', he wrote, 'que la Raison ne connalt point' (the heart has its 
reasons which Reason cannot know). Or again: 'People are neither angels nor 
beasts. Yet bad luck would have it that anyone who tries to create an angel 




creates a beast.' Amidst growing hints about the conflict between science and 
religion, he proposed his famous gamble in favour of Faith. If the Christian God 
exists, he argued, believers will inherit everlasting life. If not, they will be no 
worse off than unbelievers. In which case, Christian belief is worth the risk. 

Spinoza, a Sephardic Jew and a lens-grinder by profession, had been 
expelled from Amsterdam's Jewish community for heresy. He shared Descartes's 
intensely mathematical and logical view of a universe formed by first principles, 
and Hobbes's concept of a social contract. He was a pantheist, seeing God and 
nature as indistinguishable. The highest virtue lay in restraint guided by a full 
understanding of the world and of self. Evil derived from a lack of 
understanding. Blind faith was despicable. The Will of God' was the refuge of 
ignorance. 

In England, the advocates of 'experimental philosophy' began to organize 
themselves in the 1640s. An inner circle, led by Dr Wilkins and Dr Robert Boyle 
(1627-91), formed an 'Invisible College' in Oxford during the Civil War. They 
joined together in 1660 to found the Royal Society for the Improvement of 
Natural Knowledge. Their first meeting was addressed by the architect 
Christopher Wren. Their early membership included a number of magicians, 
whose influence was not overtaken by the new school of scientists, such as Isaac 
Newton, for another twenty years. With Newton, modern science came of age 
(see Chapter VIII); and the example of the Royal Society radiated across Europe. 

As always, old ideas mingled with the new. By the second half of the 
seventeenth century, Europe's leading thinkers were largely agreed on a 
mechanical view of the universe operating on principles analogous to clockwork. 
Galileo had divined the principle of force-the basic element of mechanics; and 
force, as applied to everything from Boyle's Law of Gases to Newton's Laws of 
Motion, could be precisely calculated. At last, it seemed, the universe and all it 
contained could be explained and measured. What is more, the laws of nature, 
which were now yielding their secrets to the scientists, could be accepted as 
examples of God's will. The Christian God, whom Aquinas had equated with 
Aristotle's 'first Cause', was now equated with 'the Great Clockmaker'. There 
was to be no more conflict between science and religion for nearly two hundred 
years, [magic] [monkey] 

Europe overseas is not a subject that starts with Columbus or the Caribbean. 
One experiment, in the crusader kingdoms of the Holy Land, was already ancient 



history. Another, in the Canaries, had been in progress for seventy years. But 
once contact had been made with distant islands, Europeans sailed overseas in 
ever-increasing numbers. They sailed for reasons of trade, of loot, of conquest, 
and increasingly of religion. For many, it provided the first meeting with people 
of different races. To validate their claim over the inhabitants of the conquered 
lands, the Spanish monarchs had first to establish that non-Europeans were 
human. According to the Requirement of 1512, which the conquistadors were 
ordered to read out to all native peoples: 'The Lord Our God, Living and Eternal, 
created Heaven and Earth, and one man and woman, of whom you and I, and all 
the men of the world, were and are descendants ...'-To confirm the point, Pope 
Paul III decreed in 1537 that 'all Indians are truly men, not only capable of 

understanding the Catholic faith, but... exceedingly desirous to receive it'.- 
[GONCALVEZ] 

The earlier voyages of exploration were continued and extended. The 
existence of a vast fourth continent in the West was gradually established by trial 
and error, some time in the twenty years after Columbus's first return to Palos. 
Responsibility for the achievement was hotly disputed. Columbus himself made 
three more voyages without ever knowing where he had really been. Another 
Genoese, Giovanni Caboto (John Cabot, 1450-98), sailed from Bristol aboard 
the Matthew in May 1497 under licence from Henry VII; he landed on Cape 
Breton Island, which he took to be part of China. The Florentine Amerigo 
Vespucci (1451-1512), once the Medicis' agent in Seville, made three or four 
transatlantic voyages between 1497 and 1504. He then obtained the post of 
piloto mayor or 'Chief Pilot' of Spain. It was this fact which determined, rightly 
or wrongly, that the fourth continent should be named after him. In 1513 a 
stowaway, Vasco NUnez de Balboa (d. 1519), walked across the isthmus of 
Panama and sighted the Pacific. In 1519-22 a Spanish expedition led by the 
Portuguese captain Ferdinand Magellan (c.1480-1521) circumnavigated the 
world. It proved beyond doubt that the earth was round, that the Pacific and 
Atlantic were separate oceans, and that the Americas lay between them, 

[SYPHILUS] 

The presence of a fifth continent in the antipodes was not suspected for 
another century. In 1605 a Spanish ship out of Peru and a Dutch ship out of Java 
both sailed to the Gulf of Carpentaria. The main outlines of the great Zuidland or 
'Southland' (Australia and New Zealand) were charted by the Dutch navigator 
Abel Tasman (1603-59) in 1642-3. 

The Portuguese were quickest to exploit the commercial opportunities of the 


new lands. They claimed Brazil in 1500, Mauritius in 1505, Sumatra in 1509, 
Malacca and the 'Spice Islands' (Indonesia) in 1511. To protect their trade, they 
established a chain of fortified stations stretching from Goa in India to Macao in 
China. The Spaniards, in contrast, did not hesitate to apply their military might. 
Lured by the dream of El Dorado the conquistadores, who had so recently 
subdued Iberia, now turned their energies to the conquest of America. They 
settled Cuba in 1511 and used it as a base for further campaigns. In 1519-20 
Hernando Cortez (1485-1547) seized the Aztec empire in Mexico in a sea of 
blood. In the 1520s and 1530s permanent settlements were established in Costa 
Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, and New Granada (Colombia and Venezuela). From 
1532 Francisco Pizarro (c.1476-1541) seized the empire of the Incas in Peru. 


SYPHILUS 

For many years it had no official name. Italians, Germans, Poles, and 
English all called it 'the French disease'. The French called it 'the 
Neapolitan disease'. The Neapolitans called it 'the Spanish disease'. The 
Portuguese called it 'the Castilian disease' and the Turks 'the Christian 
disease'. The Spanish doctor who was one of the first to treat it, Dr Ruy Diaz 
de Isla, called it 'the Serpent of Hispaniola'. 1 

Syphilis supposedly made its European debut in Barcelona in 1493. Diaz 
de Isla later claimed to have treated the master of the Nina, Vicente Pinzon; 
and it was assumed to have crossed the Atlantic with Columbus's crew. At 
all events, whether carried by sailors or slaves, or both, it reached Naples in 
1494 in time to welcome the invading French army. When the French king's 
mercenaries dispersed in the following year, they took it with them to almost 
every European country. In 1495 the Emperor Maximilian issued a decree 
against 'the Evil Pox', taken to be God's punishment for blasphemy. In 1496 
the city of Geneva tried to clean out its syphilitic brothels. In 1497, in distant 
Edinburgh, a statute ordered sufferers to the island of Inchkeith on pain of 
branding. Of Charles Vlll's campaign in Italy, Voltaire would later write: 
'France did not lose all she had won. She kept the pox.' 2 

For reasons that are unclear, the spirochete microbe, Treponema 




pallidum, which causes syphilis, assumed a specially virulent form when it 
reached Europe. It bored into the human genitals, exploiting the scabrous 
fissures that were common in the unwashed crotches of the day, forming 
highly contagious chancres. Within weeks it covered the body in suppurating 
pustules, attacked the central nervous system, and destroyed all hair. It killed 
within months, painfully. Physicians chose to apply mercury to the pustules, 
unwittingly poisoning their patients. Over six or seven decades, the 
spirochete created its own resistance and calmed down. Henceforth, it would 
be the cause of a common three-stage venereal disease that left its deformed 
and sterile hosts a longer span. By then, amongst millions, its victims had 
included Pope Julius II, Cardinal Wolsey, Henry VIII, and Ivan the Terrible. 
It was not tamed until the advent of penicillin. The impact of syphilis was 
necessarily far-reaching. It has been linked to the sexual puritanism which 
took hold on all classes short of the aristocracy; to the banishment of hitherto 
popular, and licentious, bathhouses; to the institution of hand-shaking in 
place of public kissing; and, from 1570 onwards, to the growing fashion for 
wigs. 

In 1530 the Italian poet, Girolamo Fracastoro, composed a poem about a 
shepherd struck down by the French disease. In due course, this was used by 
learned men to give the disease its learned name. The shepherd's name was 
Syphilus. 3 


European colonization in North America began in 1536 with the founding of 
Montreal in Canada by the Breton sailor Jacques Cartier (1491-1557) and in 
1565 of St Augustine in Florida by Pedro Menendez. Menendez had just 
destroyed a nearby Huguenot settlement (in the future South Carolina), where he 
hanged America's first religious exiles 'as Futherans'. Three years later the 
Huguenots' compatriot, Dominique de Gourgues, arrived on the same spot and 
hanged the Spanish garrison 'as robbers and murderers'. Western civilization 
was on the move. 

The Dutch and the English were relative latecomers to colonization, but in 
the late sixteenth century they both began to reap its benefits. Having founded 
Batavia in Java in 1597, the Dutch set out to wrest the East Indies from the 
Portuguese. The English colony of Virginia, discovered in 1598, received its first 
successful settlement at Jamestown in 1607. 'The Mayflower, carrying 120 




puritan 'Pilgrim Fathers' and their families, landed in their Plymouth Colony on 
11 (21) December 1620. The Massachusetts Bay Colony followed ten years later. 
Although religious refugees from England, they did not prove tolerant. The 
colony of Rhode Island (1636) was founded by dissenters expelled from 
Massachusetts. By that time the existence of a worldwide network of European 
colonies, and their seaborne lines of communication, was an established fact. 

The international sea trade multiplied by leaps and bounds. To the west, the 
transatlantic route was long dominated by Spain. By 1600, 200 ships a year 
entered Seville from the New World. In the peak decade of 1591-1600,19 
million grams of gold and nearly 3 billion grams of silver came with them. The 
southerly route via the Cape of Good Hope was worked first by the Portuguese 
and then by the Dutch, who also provided the main commercial link between the 
North Sea and the Mediterranean. To the east, the Dutch also pioneered a huge 
trade in Baltic grain. The growing demand for food in West European cities was 
met by the growing capacity of the Polish producers to supply. This Baltic grain 
trade reached its peak in 1618, when 118,000 lasts or 'boatloads' left Danzig for 
Amsterdam. The English trade in cloth to the Low Countries had reached record 
levels somewhat earlier, in 1550. English adventurers launched a Muscovy 
Company (1565), a Levant Company (1581), and the East India Company 
(1600). 

The nexus of all these activities was located in the Low Countries. Antwerp, 
which was the main entrepot of both the Spanish and the English trade, reigned 
supreme until the crash of 1557-60; thereafter the focus moved to Amsterdam. 
The year 1602, which saw the foundation both of the Dutch East India Company 
and of the world's first stock exchange in Amsterdam, can be taken to mark a 
new era in commercial history, [infanta] 

As overseas trade expanded, Europe received a wide range of new staple 
foods, as well as exotic 'colonial' products including pepper, coffee, cocoa, 
sugar, and tobacco. Europe's diet, cuisine, and palate were never the same again. 
The haricot bean, which was first recorded in France in 1542, the tomato, which 
spread far and wide via Italy in the same period, and the capsicum pepper, which 
was grown throughout the Balkans, were all American in origin. 


INFANTA 




In 1572 Martin de Voos painted a family portrait for Antoon Anselme, an I 
Antwerp magistrate. He portrayed the husband and wife seated at a table, 
one holding their son and the other their daughter. The picture is surmounted 
by a scrolled inscription which announces that the master of the house was 
born on 9 February 1536, his wife, Johanna Hooftmans, on 16 December 
1545, their son, Aegidius, on 21 August 1565, and their daughter, Johanna, 
on 26 September 1566. It illustrates the emergence of the modern concept of 
the family made up of distinct individuals, both children and adults. 1 

In 1579 Sanchez Coello painted a portrait of the Infanta Isabella, 
daughter of Philip II of Spain, aged thirteen. She was the complete little lady, 
resplendent in jewelled headdress, curled hair, high ruff, formal gown, and 
ringed fingers. The tradition would last in the Spanish court until the 1650s, 
and the famous series by Velazquez of another Infanta, Margharita of 
Austria, daughter of Philip IV. Once again, the exquisite seven- or eight-year 
old is shown as a lady in miniature, dressed in corset and crinoline, and 
topped by the ringlets of a lady's coiffure. Children were still thought of as 
persons of lesser stature, not fully grown, but not qualitatively different from 
their parents. 2 (See Plate 51.) 

In earlier times, neither the nuclear family nor the age of childhood had been 
recognized as distinct entities. All generations lived together in large 
households. Children passed straight from swaddling clothes into adult 
dress. They participated in all the household's games and activities. In all but 
the richest classes, they had little or no schooling; if they were taught at all, 
they were taught together. They were usually put out to work as domestics or 
apprentices at the age of seven or eight. They died in such numbers that 
everyone had the greatest incentive for them to grow up fast. Families 
existed, but they 'existed in silence'. Childhood, too, existed; but it was 
granted no special status, and it was ended as soon as possible. 

The 'discovery of childhood' was a process which took shape between 
the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries. It can be traced in the dress and 
iconography of the times, in the invention of toys, games, and pastimes 
specifically for children, in changing morals and manners; above all, in a 
radical new approach to education. 

Medieval children had largely learned by living, eating, and sleeping 



with their elders, all of whose activities they observed at first hand. They 
were not isolated or protected from the adult world. Only boys from higher 
society attended school, and they did so in all-purpose, all-age groups. One 
of the earliest instances of a school being divided into classes was recorded 
at St Paul's School in London in 1519. With age-grouping, and the extension 
of schooling, came a great increase in imposed discipline. Christian morality, 
codes of conduct, and humiliating punishments were imposed from above. 
Schoolboys were the first to be introduced to a prolonged and graduated 
progression towards adulthood. Girls, sometimes married as early as 
thirteen, were much more likely to miss out. 

Childhood implies innocence. Yet immodesty in children, and in 
relationships with them, had long been taken as natural. The boyhood 
conduct of Louis XIII (b. 1601) was observed in every detail by the court 
physician, Dr Heroard. The Dauphin was not reprimanded for groping his 
governess in bed, for instance, nor for showing off his first erections, which 
went up and down 'like a drawbridge'. Married at fourteen, he was placed in 
the nuptial bed by his mother, to whom he returned 'after about an hour and 
performing twice', 'with his cock all red'. 3 

The 'ages of Man', as summarized by the soliloquy in As You Like It, clearly 
constituted a well-formed scheme by Shakespeare's time. But every century 
has made its contribution to generational concepts. If childhood was 
discovered in early modern Europe, adolescence was discovered by the 
Romantics, after Goethe's Werther, and 'senior citizens' by the post¬ 
industrial era. 


Europe's intercourse with America, heretofore a largely hermetic ecological 
zone, led to a vast Exchange of people, diseases, plants, and animals. This 
'Columbian Exchange' worked decidedly in Europe's favour. European colonists 
braved hardship and deprivation, and in some places faced hostile 'Indians'. But 
their losses were minuscule compared to the genocidal casualties which they and 
their firearms inflicted. They brought some benefits, but with them depopulation 
and despoliation on a grand scale. Europe received syphilis; but its ravages were 
not to be compared to the pandemics of smallpox, pleurisy, and typhus which 
literally decimated the native Americans. The Europeans re-introduced horses; in 




return they received two foods of capital importance, potatoes and maize, as well 
as the turkey, the most substantial and nutritious of domestic poultry. Potatoes 
were adopted in Ireland at an early date, and moved steadily across northern 
Europe, becoming the staple of Germany, Poland, and Russia. Maize, which was 
variously known as 'American corn' and 'American fallow', enriched exhausted 
soil and greatly facilitated both crop rotation and livestock farming. It was well 
established in the Po valley in the sixteenth century. It was inhibited from 
crossing the Alps until climatic conditions improved some hundred years later, 
but its long-term impact was enormous. There is good reason to count American 
additions to the food supply as one of the major factors underlying the dramatic 

growth of Europe's population at the end of the early modern period/ 
[SYPHILUS] 

Descriptions of the arrival of Europeans in America have recently undergone 
fundamental revision. They have been 'decolumbianized'. What was once 'the 
discovery' is now called an 'encounter' or a 'meeting of cultures'.- It would be 
better to be honest and call it a conquest. Columbus, too, has been downgraded. 
The primacy of his voyages has been handed to Vikings or Irishmen, or even to a 
Welshman in a coracle. His landing on San Salvador (Watling Island) has been 
relocated to Samana Cay in the Bahamas.- The 'peerless navigator' is now said 
to have been a ruthless and rapacious 'colonialist pirate', alternatively a quixotic 
Jew sailing in search of the lost tribes of Israel.- He is even said to have heard 
about the other continent from American women already in Europe.- The 
sources for Columbus's activities are meagre, the myths abundant.- The real 
discoverers of America are those who went in the steps of the conquistadores, 
often friars like Bernardino de Sahagun, 'the world's first-anthropologist', and 
who tried to understand what was happening.- 

Intercourse with America had a profound impact on European culture. A gulf 
began to open between those countries which had ready access to the New World 
and those which did not. 'Philosophy is born of the merchant. Science is born of 
commerce. Henceforth, Europe is almost cut into two. The West is preoccupied 
with the sea. The East is preoccupied with itself.'- 

Early modern society was not conceived in terms of class, which is a more 
recent invention, but in terms of social orders or 'estates'-in Latin status, in 
German Stande, in French etat. These basic social groups were defined by their 
function, by the legal restrictions and privileges which were imposed in order to 


facilitate that function, and by their corporate institutions. Wealth and income 
played only a secondary role. Heredity was the main criterion for determining to 
which estate (save the clergy) any particular family might belong. 

The nobility, for example, descendants of medieval knighthood, were defined 
by their military function and by laws giving them special rights to 
landownership and to the government of their properties. With the growth of 
standing armies, their exclusive military function was somewhat diminished, but 
their position as the backbone of the ruling caste remained. Through their 
regional assemblies they ran local politics in the countryside, and they usually 
enjoyed full jurisdiction over the inhabitants of their lands. In most countries 
they were headed by an upper crust such as the peers of England or the grandees 
of Spain; or else they were divided, as in Germany, into numerous ranks. The 
burgher estate, built on the liberties of self-governing cities and of the city 
guilds, was also stratified between the patricians, the freemen, and the 
propertyless plebs. It was usually protected by royal charters, and enjoyed full 
jurisdiction within the city walls. The peasants consisted of an enserfed majority 
and a minority who remained free or who were emerging from serfdom. The 
status of the serfs could vary considerably depending whether they lived on 
church, crown, or noble land. 

The existence of many fragmented jurisdictions was incompatible with state 
despotism, and hence with Muscovite Tsarism or Ottoman rule. Here was the 
social base which rendered western absolutism rather different from eastern 
autocracy. It was built on a mass of practices inherited from the earlier period 
and, despite innovations, was still essentially medieval. In the West as in the 
East, the social constraints on individuals remained very onerous by modern 
standards. Everyone, and not just the serf, was expected to belong to a corporate 
body and to abide by its rules. Renaissance individualism used to be celebrated 
by historians like Burckhardt exactly because they welcomed the first frail 
attempts to break free from the prevailing social curbs and compartments. When 
an exception was made, as when Michelangelo was released from his guild of 
artisans, it took a Pope to make it.- 

The price revolution, Europe's first encounter with inflation, was initially 
attributed to the wickedness of usurers. From the 1550s, through the researches 
of the University of Salamanca, it was attributed to the influx of Spanish gold 
and silver. 'What makes Spain poor', wrote a commentator, 'is her wealth.'- 


Although the view of contemporaries was blurred by the wild fluctuation of 
prices and by governments' repeated attempts to cope by debasing their coinage, 
it is perfecdy clear that the general trend throughout the sixteenth century was 
for a steady price rise. Grain prices in France, for example, where the supply of 
coin was relatively scarce, were over seven times higher in 1600 than in 1500. 

The cost of living, especially in Western Europe, rose dramatically (see 
Appendix III, p. 1263). Explaining this, recent scholars have laid less emphasis 
on bullion and more on population growth, on land hunger, and on rising rents 
and taxation. In the sixteenth century, Europe's five giant cities of 100,000 + 
rose to perhaps fourteen: Constantinople, Naples, Venice, Milan, Paris, Rome, 
Palermo, Messina, Marseilles, Lisbon, Seville, Antwerp, Amsterdam, and 
Moscow. Peasants flooded into the growing towns; wages lagged behind prices; 
beggars proliferated. Landowners maximized their profits; governments, 
constantly hit by the falling value of their income, raised taxes. There was little 
relief until the early seventeenth century. 

The social consequences of the price revolution are the subject of immense 
controversy. The expansion of the money economy encouraged social mobility, 
especially in England and Holland. The commercial bourgeoisie was gready 
strengthened. Capitalism reached the point of take-off. Yet the growth of cities in 
the West was closely linked to the parallel growth of 'neoserfdom' in the East. 
The nobility of Germany, Poland, and Hungary strengthened their position whilst 
their counterparts further west were thrown into confusion. English historians of 
the period cannot agree whether the gentry was rising or falling. The English 
Civil War has been variously attributed to the self-assertion of a confident gentry 
against a ruined aristocracy and to the desperation of a gentry impoverished by 
the price revolution.- [cap-ag] 

Particularly interesting are the links between economic and religious 
developments. The Protestant Reformation had always been explained in 
religious and political terms. But Marxists have not been alone in seeing a 
correlation between 'the Protestant ethic' and commercial enterprise. Max 
Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1904) and Richard 
Tawney's Religion and the Rise of Capitalism (1926), though much criticized in 
detail, have inspired a whole school of comment. Capitalism, after all, needed its 
ideologues as well as its technicians. In this, Protestant writers undoubtedly 
played an important role in opposing deep-seated attitudes about usury. But they 
did so at a rather later date than historians once supposed. Tawney relies heavily 


for evidence on the English Puritan Richard Baxter; Weber, anachronistically, on 
the eighteenth-century American Benjamin Franklin. It was not until 1658 that 
the state of Holland ruled that no banker should be denied communion for 
practising usury. Theory, therefore, lagged well behind practice, [usury] 

In reality, capitalism thrived no less in Catholic than in Protestant cities. 
Fugger of Augsburg was no Puritan. He thrived because of expanding trade and 
industry, and because war, for all its destructiveness, stimulated demand for 
goods and for financial services. Protestant divines were less effective as 
advocates of capitalist techniques than the numerous refugee entrepreneurs who 
flooded into Protestant countries. 

It was through these migrations that the seeds of medieval capitalism were 
scattered throughout Europe. The biggest businessman in Geneva, Francesco 
Turrettini (1547-1628), was a refugee from Fucca. Fouis de Geer (1587-1652), 
financier and industrialist to Gustavus Adolphus in Sweden, came from Fiege. 
Marcus Perez (1527-72), William the Silent's original bankroller, was a Jewish 
converso from Spain.- 

The military changes of the era-which like most things are now classed as a 
'Revolution'-had far-reaching effects. In essence, they involved the 
introduction of new weaponry, principally the pike, the musket, and improved 
artillery; the establishment of systematic training, which required professional 
cadres and instructors; and the growth of standing armies, which only the richest 
princes could afford. 

One thing followed from another. The 16-ft Swiss infantry pike provided the 
long-desired means for stopping cavalry charges. But it could only be effectively 
deployed in a mobile square of pikemen, who had to wheel and manoeuvre with 
precision to face the swirling line of attack. As the Spaniards discovered, it was 
best used in conjunction with muskets, whose firepower could actually bring the 
attackers down. The musket's accuracy, however, and its reloading rate, left 
much to be desired. It was only effective when a body of musketeers were 
trained to fire in unison, moving smartly in and out of the pike square between 
salvoes. Though it first appeared in 1512 at Ravenna, it was only widely adopted 
from the 1560s in the wars of the Fow Countries. The combination of pike and 
musket demanded elaborate drill techniques, together with the steadiness and 
esprit de corps of disciplined professionals. 

An answer to the pike square was found in the development of massed 


artillery. The cannon, which was fast rendering medieval fortifications obsolete, 
now came to be widely used on the battlefield for opening up gaps in the enemy 
line. Yet expanded artillery trains required complex technical support, an 
efficient iron industry, high-quality gunpowder, expensive transport, and 
professional gunners. 

In naval warfare, the increased calibre of the cannon stimulated a rapid 
growth in the size, tonnage, and manoeuvrability of ships. Warships had to be 
turned into floating gun platforms. The increased range of ships stimulated the 
science of navigation, which depended in turn on precision instruments, on 
sound astronomical data and cartography, and on advanced mathematics. 

On land, great thought was given to rescuing the art of fortification from the 
effects of artillery bombardment. The trace italienne, which appeared in the mid¬ 
sixteenth century, set out a sophisticated system of ditches, entrapments, and 
low, angled bastions, which denied the cannoneers easy targets and access, 
whilst exposing them to withering counterfire. Antwerp, fortified in this way by 
Italian engineers in 1568, started a trend which was to bring back the prevalence 
of siege warfare. By the time of the celebrated Sebastien le Prestre de Vauban 
(1633-1707), the engineers had regained the advantage over the artillerymen 
(see p. 619). Cavalry never became obsolete, but was forced to adapt. It was 
increasingly divided into dedicated regiments; of light horse for reconnaissance 
and skirmishing; of lancers for battlefield offence; and of mounted dragoons for 
mobile firepower. 

The military commanders who supervised these developments were faced 
with a welter of unfamiliar technological and organizational problems. Part-time 
gentlemen soldiers could no longer cope. The emergence of salaried career 
officers was accompanied by the consolidation of a professional military and 
naval caste. Military careers offered prospects not only for sons of the old 
nobility but for all talents. Rulers had to found military academies for their 
training. 

Rulers also had to find new sources of income for their armies, and a new 
bureaucracy to administer them. Once they had done so, however, they found 
that they possessed an incomparable political instrument for reducing the power 
of the nobles and for forcing their subjects to obey. The modern state without the 
military revolution is unthinkable. The road from the arquebus to absolutism, or 
from the maritime mortar to mercantilism, was a direct one. 

Yet the military revolution is another subject where would-be theorists have 



been tempted to use their localized studies from parts of Western Europe for 
making unwarranted generalizations about the whole continent. It is often 
implied that East European methods of warfare, in which the cavalry did not 
cede supremacy to the infantry, were somehow retarded. They were not. The 
armies of Poland or Muscovy needed no lessons from their Western 
counterparts. They were soon familiar with the latest technical and 
organizational developments; but fighting across the vast empty expanses of the 
East, in a harsh climate, they met logistical problems unknown in the 
battlegrounds of northern Italy or the Netherlands. When Poland's wonderful 
winged hussars met Western-style infantry, as they did against the Swedes at 
Kirchholm in 1605, they wreaked terrible slaughter. They repeated the 
performance when they faced hordes of orientalstyle light horse at Klushino in 
1610 or at Chocim in 1621 (see below). At the same time, thanks to the flexible, 
cell-like structure of their units, the towarzysze or hussar 'comrades' were able to 
forage and skirmish and to sustain themselves in hostile country where all less 
adaptable armies were devoured. In their encounters with the Poles, the 
Muscovites experienced many decades of failure, often because of ill-conceived 
Western innovations. But they possessed first-class artillery from an early date; 
and it was the Russian artillery which finally broke Sweden's military 
supremacy at Poltava.- 

'The nation-state' and 'nationalism' are terms which are frequently applied, or 
misapplied, to the sixteenth century. They are more appropriate to the nineteenth, 
when they were invented by historians looking for the origins of the nation-states 
of their own day. They should certainly not be used to convey premature 
preoccupations with ethnic identity. What they can properly convey, however, is 
the strong sense of sovereignty which both monarchs and subjects assumed, as 
the unity of the Middle Ages disintegrated. Their overriding raison d'etat had an 
economic dimension associated with mercantilism, as well as the purely political 
one. 

II Principe (The Prince), written in 1513, served as the handbook for all such 
rulers who wished to reach a position of untrammelled command. It is often 
judged to be the starting-point of modern political science. Its author, Niccolo 
Machiavelli (1469-1527), historian, dramatist, and Florentine diplomat, who had 
observed Cesare Borgia and Pope Alexander VI, 'the great deceiver', at close 
quarters, wrote his book in the hope that it would inspire a prince to fulfil 


Dante's old dream of a unified Italy. But its appeal was universal. By separating 
politics from moral scruples, it gave voice to the art of Machtpolitik or 
untrammelled power politics. At one level this 'Machiavellianism' caused grave 
scandal. Concepts such as frodi onorevoli (honourable frauds) or scelleratezze 
gloriose (glorious rascalries) became notorious. At a more serious level, if The 
Prince is read in conjunction with the Discourses on Livy, Machiavelli can be 
seen to have been a devoted advocate of limited government, of the rule of law 
and of liberty. His low view of human nature provides the ground base on which 
constitutional structures have to be built. But it is his cynical aphorisms that 
were best remembered. 'The nearer people are to the Church of Rome,' he wrote, 
'the more irreligious they are.' 'A prince who desires to maintain his position 
must learn to be good or not as needs may require.' 'War should be the only 
study of a prince. He should look upon peace only as a breathing space which ... 
gives him the means to execute military plans.' Machiavelli has had no shortage 
of disciples. 

On the subject of the model Renaissance prince, most historians would think 
in the first place of the Italian despots like Lorenzo the Magnificent or Ludovico 
Sforza. After that they would probably propose those formidable neighbours and 
rivals, Francis I and Henry VIII, whose meeting on the 'Field of Cloth of Gold' 
(1520) exemplified so many quirks and qualities of the age. Yet none deserves 
more attention than Matthias Hunyadi 'Corvinus', King of Hungary (r. 1458- 
90). 

Corvinus-so called from the raven in his coat-of-arms-was a social 
upstart, the son of a baron and crusader from Transylvania, Iancu of Hunedoara, 
(Janos Hunyadi), who had made his name fighting the Turks. He used his 
Transylvanian base and a strong mercenary army to subdue the Hungarian 
magnates, and to initiate a reign where Italian culture was made the mark of 
political prestige. He had been educated by the humanist Archbishop Vitez; he 
was married to a neapolitan princess, Beatrice of Aragon; and he succeeded to a 
royal court which had cultivated its Italian ties since Angevin times. The court at 
Buda was filled with books, pictures, and philosophers, and was in touch with all 
the leading scholars of the day, from Poliziano to Ficino. It also boasted a great 
library, which as a collection of incunabula and manuscripts was the chief rival 
of the Medicis' library in Florence. In 1485, when Corvinus captured Vienna, he 
looked to be on the brink of founding a Hungaro-Austrian monarchy that would 
soon make a solid bid for control of the Empire. In the event, all plans were 
brought to naught by his sudden death. His scholarly son was rejected by the 



Hungarian nobles in favour of a Jagiellon. With some small delay, the pickings 
were taken by the Habsburgs and the Turks. Like the books of the plundered 
royal library, the traces of Renaissance Hungary were scattered to the winds, 

[CORVINA] 

Of course, the strengthening of royal power in some quarters does not mean 
that one can talk about the general advent of absolutism, except as one of several 
competing ideals. In France, the restraints on the king were still so great that 
scholars can debate at length whether, under Francis I, for instance, French 
government was 'more consultative' or 'less decentralised'.- In England, after 
the assertion of Tudor monarchy, it was Parliament which asserted itself under 
the subsequent rule of the Stuarts. In the Holy Roman Empire the imperial Diet 
gained ground against the Emperor. In Poland-Lithuania republicanism 
triumphed over monarchy. 

True enough, some Renaissance scholars, like Bude, looked to the Roman 
Empire for their views on monarchy; but others like Bishop Goslicki (Goslicius) 
looked back to the Roman Republic. Of the two most influential political 
treatises of the period, the De la Republique (1576) of Jean Bodin favoured 
constitutional monarchy, whilst the Leviathan (1651) of Thomas Hobbes made 
eccentric use of contract theory to favour absolutism. Without much evidence, 
Hobbes maintained that kings held unlimited rights because at some unspecified 
time in the past their subjects had supposedly surrendered their own rights. The 
resultant Leviathan, a 'monster composed of men'-his metaphor for the 
modern state- was a regrettable necessity, the only alternative to endless 
conflict: 

During the time when men live without a common power to keep them in awe, they are in that condition 
which is called war... where every man is enemy to every man. In such condition, there is no place for 
industry ... no navigation ... no arts, no letters, no society, and ... continual fear of violent death; and the 
life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.- 

The Renaissance stimulated the study of Roman law; but the period was 
equally marked by the reinforcement and collation of separate national laws and, 
in the treatise Dejure belli et pads (1625) of Hugo De Groot (Grotius, 1583- 
1645), by the emergence of international law. 


CORVINA 





Some time in the 1460s Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, started 
collecting books. His passion was inspired by his old mentor, Janos Vitez, 
Bishop of Varad (Oradea), and by the Bishop's nephew, Janos Csezmiczei. 
Both men were classical scholars, both educated in Italy, and both fervent 
bibliophiles. The former rose to become Primate of Hungary, the latter, as 
'Janus Pannonius', the leading Latin poet of the age. When both were 
disgraced by a political plot, the Primate retired; the poet committed suicide; 
and the King added their libraries to his own. In 1476 Matthias married 
Beatrice of Aragon, who brought her own rich book collection from Naples. 
In 1485 he captured Vienna, laying plans for a new Hungaro-Austrian 
monarchy, whose cultural centrepiece was to be the royal library, then under 
construction in Buda. Staffed by an army of archivists, copyists, translators, 
binders, and illuminators, and by a transcontinental network of agents, the 
Biblioteca Corviniana was designed to excel in Europe's 'revival of letters'. 
It even excelled the magnificent library of Lorenzo the Magnificent in 
Florence. 

None of King Matthias's hopes were realized. When he died in 1490, his 
son did not succeed him. The Habsburgs recovered Vienna, and the 
Hungarian nobles rebelled against their taxes. Work on the library stopped. 
When the Ottoman army captured Buda in 1526, the Library was pillaged. 
Most of its contents, including 650 ancient manuscripts of unique value, 
disappeared. 

All, however, was not lost. On the quincentenary of King Matthias's 
death, Hungary's National Library mounted an exhibition to reassemble the 
surviving treasures. It turned out that Queen Beatrice had contrived to send 
some prize items back to Naples. Her daughter-in-law had taken others off to 
Germany. Charles V's sister Mary, sometime Queen of Hungary, brought 
still more to Brussels. Most importantly, it emerged that the store of looted 
books in Constantinople had been used over the centuries as a gift fund for 
favoured foreign ambassadors. The priceless descriptive catalogue of the 
Corviniana prepared by the King's Florentine agent, Naldo Naldi, had been 
given by a sultan to a Polish ambassador and preserved at Toruri. Seneca's 
tragedies, presented to an English ambassador, were preserved in Oxford. 
The Byzantine 'Book of Ceremonies' was preserved in Leipzig, [taxis] 
Twenty-six manuscripts sent to Francis-Joseph were kept in Vienna. Still 
more found their way into the library of Duke Augustus at Wolfenbiittel. 



Uppsala was holding pieces which Queen Christina's army had looted from 
Prague ... Madrid, Besan^on, Rome, and Volterra all contributed. 

The 1990 exhibition contained only fragments of the lost collection. But 
they were enough to show that bibliophilia lay at the heart of the 
Renaissance urge. In size and variety, the Biblioteca Corviniana had been 
second only to the Vatican Library. Thanks to the circumstances of its 
dispersal, its role in the spread of learning was probably second to none. 1 


Mercantilism, or The mercantile system', is a label that had little currency 
until popularized in the late eighteenth century, [market] Yet the set of ideas 
which Adam Smith was to criticize formed the main stock of economic thought 
of the early modern period. Mercantilism has meant many things to many men; 
but in essence it referred to the conviction that in order to prosper, the modern 
state needed to manipulate every available legal, administrative, military, and 
regulatory device. In this sense, it was the opposite of the laissez-faire system, 
which Smith would later advocate. In one popular form it consisted of 
bullionism-the idea that a country's wealth and power depended on amassing 
gold. In another, it concentrated on improving the balance of trade by assisting 
exports, penalizing imports, and encouraging home manufactures. In all forms, it 
was concerned with strengthening the sources of economic power-colonies, 
manufactures, navies, tariffs-and was expressly directed against a country's 
commercial rivals. In the Dutch version-where even the navy was controlled by 
five separate admiralties-policy was largely left to private and to local 
initiative. In the French, and later the Prussian, version, it was held very firmly 
in the hands of the king's ministers. In England it depended on a mixture of 
private and royal initiative. An early exposition can be found in The Discourse of 
the Common Weal of this Realm of England (1549). The ordinary means to 
encrease our wealth and treasure is by Foreign Trade,' wrote Thomas Mun a 
little later, 'wherein we must ever observe this rule: to sell more to strangers 
yearly than we consume of theirs in value.'- 

Diplomatic practice, like mercantilist thought, developed in response to the rise 
of state power. In the past, monarchs had been content to recall their 
ambassadors as soon as each mission was concluded. In the fifteenth century, 
Venice was the only power to maintain a network of permanent embassies 





abroad, until the papal nunciatures and other Italian cities followed the Venetian 
lead. From about 1500, however, sovereign rulers gradually saw the appointment 
of resident ambassadors as a sign of their status and independence. They also 
valued the influx of commercial and political intelligence. One of the first was 
Ferdinand the Catholic, whose embassy to the Court of St James dates from 
1487 and was originally headed by Dr Rodrigo Gondesalvi de Puebla, later by a 
woman-Catherine of Aragon, Princess of Wales, the King's daughter. Francis I 
of France is usually credited with having the first comprehensive royal 
diplomatic service, including an embassy at the Ottoman Porte from 1526. 

Soon, a corps diplomatique appeared in every major court and capital. 
Living in conditions of some danger, the diplomats quickly worked out the 
necessary rules of immunity, reciprocity, extraterritoriality, credence, and 
precedence. In 1515 the Pope ruled that the nuncio should act as doyen of the 
corps, that the imperial ambassador should have precedence over his colleagues, 
and that all other ambassadors should be given seniority according to the date of 
their country's conversion to Christianity. In practice the arrangement did not 
work, because Charles V preferred Spanish to imperial diplomats and because, 
as the 'Most Catholic' King of Spain, he refused to cede precedence to the 
French. This launched a quarrel where French and Spanish ambassadors stolidly 
held their ground for 200 years. On one occasion, at the Hague in 1661, when 
the retinues of the French and Spanish ambassadors met in a narrow street, the 
diplomats stood rooted to the spot for a whole day, until the city council 
demolished the railings and enabled them to pass on equal terms. The 
Muscovites were equal sticklers for form. The Tsar's ambassadors were wont to 
demand precedence over the Emperor's own courtiers. In Warsaw, one 
Muscovite ambassador arrived wearing two hats-one to be raised to the King of 
Poland in the customary greeting, the other to keep his head covered according 
to the instructions of the Kremlin. 

In the age of Machiavelli, diplomats soon gained a reputation for deception. 
They had to be familiar with codes, ciphers,' and invisible ink. 'An ambassador', 
quipped Sir Henry Wootton, 'is an honest man sent to lie abroad for the good of 
his country.' None the less, the growth of permanent diplomacy marked an 
important stage in the formation of a community of nations. In 1643-8, when a 
great diplomatic conference was convened at Munster and at Osnabriick to 
terminate the Thirty Years War, the 'Concert of Europe' was already coming into 
existence. 



At the turn of the sixteenth century, the central sensation on the map of Europe 
came from the sudden rise of the House of Habsburg to a position of immoderate 
greatness. The Habsburgs' success was not achieved by conquest but by the 
failure of rival dynasties, by far-sighted matrimonial schemes, and by sheer good 
fortune. Fortes bella gerant, ran the motto, Tu felix Austria nube.* The emphasis 
was on felix, 'fortunate', and nube, 'marry'. 

In 1490 Maximilian I of Habsburg, King of the Romans, was still a refugee 
from Hungarian-occupied Vienna. His hold on the Empire looked precarious; 
and he was obliged to initiate a series of imperial reforms from a position of 
weakness. He oversaw the establishment in 1495 of the Reichskammergericht 
(Imperial Court of Justice), in 1500 of the Reichsregiment (the permanent 
Council of Regency), and in 1512 of the Reichsschliisse or 'Mandates' of the 
Imperial Diet. With the creation of three Colleges of the Diet-Electors, Princes, 
Cities-and the division of the Empire into ten territorial Circles, each under the 
directorium of two princes charged with administering justice, taxation, and 
military matters, he effectively surrendered all direct rule of the Empire. He 
made the House of Habsburg indispensable to the German princes by giving 
them all they had ever desired. 

Simultaneously, Maximilian greatly strengthened the Habsburgs' Hausmacht, 
the dynasty's private power. The early death of his first wife, Mary, had given 
him the fabulous Duchy of Burgundy; and in 1490 he inherited Tirol, giving him 
his favourite residence at Innsbruck. One inheritance treaty in 1491 with the 
Jagiellons gave him the reversion of Bohemia, another in 1515 the reversion of 
Hungary. Both policies would mature on the death of Louis Jagiellon in 1526, 
leaving the dynasty with 'the foundations of a Danubian monarchy'.- Equally 
important was the marriage of his son to the heiress of Ferdinand and Isabella, 
which put a grappling hook onto the Spanish dominions. In 1497 his own second 
marriage to Bianca Sforza of Milan eased the cash flow and assisted his 
confirmation as Emperor in 1508. By then this most ideological of the 
Habsburgs must have felt that his mission was being fulfilled. Shortly 
afterwards, he was confident enough to propose that he be elected Pope! 

When Maximilian died, his grandson Charles of Ghent succeeded to a 
collection of real estate 'on which the sun never set'. To cap it all, with the help 
of the Fuggers' ducats, Charles overcame French and papal opposition to be 
elected Holy Roman Emperor in record time and in immediate succession to his 
grandfather. (See Appendix III, p. 1270.) [dollar] 


DOLLAR 


Jachimov is a small Bohemian town in the Joachimsthal, some 80 km north 
of Plzen (Pilsen). In 1518 Count von Schlick was granted an imperial patent 
to mine silver there and to establish a mint. His silver coins were produced 
by Walzenwerke or boiling machines', and were formally classed as 'large 
groats'. Their popular name was Joachimsthaler, soon shortened to thaler. 

By the seventeenth century the thaler had become a unit of currency all 
over central Europe. It had also been copied in Habsburg Spain, whose 
taleros or 'pieces of eight' circulated throughout the Americas. They were 
known in English as 'dollars'. The 30 shilling silver piece of James VI of 
Scotland was dubbed 'the Sword Dollar'. In the eighteenth century silver 
thalers were widely replaced by copper 'plate money' imported from 
Sweden, which acquired the Swedish name of daler. A copper daler of 1720 
was equivalent in value to a silver thaler, even though its weight was 250 
times greater; and it could only be transported by horse and cart. 1 

The acknowledged masterpiece of the series, however, was the Maria 
Theresa dollar of 1751. This superb coin bore the bust of the Empress, with 
the two-headed eagle on the reverse, and the inscription: 

Rfomae] IMPferatrix] * HUfngariae et] BOfhemiae] REG[ina] * Mfaria] 
THERESIA * D[ei] Gfratia] ARCHIDfux] AUSTfriae] * DUX 
BURG[undiae] *COM[es] TUR[olis]* 

It continued to be minted in millions throughout the nineteenth century, 
all posthumous issues bearing the date of the Empress's death in 1780. It was 
minted by Mussolini in 1936 to finance the invasion of Abyssinia, and by the 
British in Bombay. Two hundred years later, it still circulates in parts of Asia 
as an international trade currency. 2 

The dollar was adopted as the currency of the USA in 1787, and of 
Canada in 1871. But it figures no longer among the currency units of 
Europe. 


Charles V (Emperor 1519-56), whose realms stretched from the Philippines 





to Peru, was gradually overwhelmed by the multiplicity of competing problems. 
Physically, he was most unimperial: weak adenoids gave him a whining voice 
and a permanently drooping mouth, which an insolent Spanish grandee once told 
him to shut ho keep the flies out'. Yet he possessed many talents for governing 
his vast dominions, speaking Flemish by choice, Spanish, French, and Italian to 
his officials, 'and German to his horse'. And he was not lacking in fortitude. 
'Name me an emperor who was ever struck by a cannon-ball,' he retorted when 
refusing to remain in the rear at Miihlberg. As the accepted leader of the Catholic 
princes, he headed the strongest cause which might have held Christendom 
together. Yet the sheer size and complexity of the internal and external crises 
defied coordinated action. In the Church, though successful in launching the 
General Council, he realized that the deliberations at Trent were only hardening 
divided opinions. His plans for restoring religious unity in the Empire were 
disastrously delayed. Despite the victory at Miihlberg, the wars of the 
Schmalkaldic League ended with the stalemate of the Peace of Augsburg (1555). 
In Spain, where he reigned as co-king with his mentally disturbed mother, he 
wrestled with the revolt of the comuneros and then with the divergent interests of 
Castile and Aragon. In the New World he fought a losing battle to protect the 
Amerindians. In the Netherlands, which he had left in the hands of his aunt, 
Margaret, he was painfully obliged to suppress the revolt of his native Ghent by 
force (1540). In the main hereditary Habsburg lands-Austria, Bohemia, and 
Hungary-which he had consigned to his brother Ferdinand, he faced constant 
opposition from local leaders, such as Jan Zapolyai in Transylvania, and in 
1546-7 the first Bohemian Revolt. Everywhere he had to struggle with 
provincial diets, fractious nobles, particularist interests. On the strategic scale, he 
had to cope with the hostility of France, with the expansion of the Turks, and 
with the threat of Franco-Ottoman co-operation. 

Rivalry with France engendered five wars, fought at all the points of 
territorial contact-in the Netherlands, in Lorraine, in Savoy, in the Pyrenees, 
and in Italy- and, indirectly, to the great shame of his life, the Sack of Rome 
(1527). Fear of the Turks led to Habsburg takeovers in Hungary and Bohemia; in 
the longer run, however, they produced an endless series of exhausting 
complications, both in the Balkans and in the Mediterranean, [orange] 

In his last decade, Charles V might have had some grounds for optimism. 
But the Peace of Augsburg was a disappointment; and, endlessly frustrated, he 
abdicated. He left Spain and the Netherlands to his son Philip, the rest to his 
brother. He died in retreat at Yuste. He was the last Emperor to cherish a dream 



of universal unity, and has been invoked by some in contemporary times as 
patron of a united Europe. 'Charles V, once regarded as the last fighter of a 
rearguard action,' writes an interested party, 'is suddenly seen to have been a 
forerunner.'- 

After the abdication, the Austrian Habsburgs forgot Charles's universal 
vision. Maximilian II (r. 1564-76), grandson of the Jagiellons, gained nothing 
from his nominal election as King of Poland-Lithuania. His two sons, Rudolf II 
(r. 1576-1612), the eccentric hermit of Prague, and Matthias (r. 1612-19), were 
fully absorbed by their mutual suspicions and by religious discord. Over 200 
religious revolts or riots took place in the decade after the Donauworth Incident 
of 1607. Ferdinand II (r. 1619-37), Ferdinand III (r. 1637-57), and Feopold I (r. 
1658-1705) were entirely consumed by the Thirty Years War and its aftermath. 
With the emergence of a permanent and separate Austrian chancellery in Vienna, 
the centre of gravity of their operation was shifting decisively to the East, whilst 
the Empire itself seemed to teeter on the edge of imminent dissolution. As the 
drinkers in the tavern of Goethe's Faust were given to singing: 


ORANGE 


In 1544, at the height of the Franco-Imperial wars, an officer of the Imperial 
Army, Rene von Nassau, was killed at St Dizier by a French bullet. His 
death was to drive events that would affect the history not only of his native 
Nassau but of Provence, the Netherlands, and Ireland. 

Nassau was a small German duchy on the right bank of the middle Rhine. 
Between the Westerwald forests and the rugged Taunus Mountains north of 
Wiesbaden, Nassau's fertile Rheingau contained some of Germany's finest 
vineyards, including Johanisberg and Rudesheim. Rene's father, Heinrich 
von Nassau, resided at Siegen, sharing the duchy with the cadet branch of 
the family at Dillenberg. Rene's mother, Claudia, was the sister and heiress 
of an imperial general, Philibert de Chalons, who had led the sack of Rome 
and who had been richly rewarded by Charles V with lands in Brabant. 
Moreover, she had taken over Philibert's title to the Principality of Orange. 
When the heirless Rene was killed, it emerged that he had bequeathed his 
collection of lands and titles to his eleven-year-old cousin, William of 
Nassau-Dillenburg. 

Orange was a small sovereign principality on the left bank of the Rhone 
north of Avignon. (See Appendix III, p. 1254.) Bordered to the east by the 
heights of Mont Ventoux, it was a rich wine-growing district, several of 
whose villages, such as Gigondas and Chateauneuf-du-Pape, were to become 
famous. Its tiny capital, ancient Arausio, was dominated by the huge Roman 
arch erected by Tiberius. From the twelfth century it was a fief of the counts 
of Provence, and hence of the Empire. But in 1393 the heiress to Orange, 
Marie de Baux, was given in marriage to the Burgundian Jean de Chalons; 
and it was their descendants who thereafter became the principality's 
absentee rulers. In 1431, when the Count of Provence needed a ransom in a 
hurry, he agreed to sell off the Chalons' obligation to homage, thereby 
making them princes of Orange in their own right. As an independent 
enclave within the Kingdom of France, Orange attracted many Italian and 



Jewish merchants, and in the mid-sixteenth century it was fast becoming a 
Protestant bastion. 1 It would eventually be suppressed by Louis XIV, who 
decided to put an end to this nest of Huguenots in 1703. 

Thanks to his inheritances in Germany, Provence, and Brabant, William of 
Nassau-Dillenburg (1533-84) became one of the richest men in Europe. He 
even held a claim to the defunct Kingdom of Arles. Born a Lutheran but 
raised as a Catholic at the imperial court in Brussels, where he called the 
Regent Margaret 'mother 5 , he set up his own affluent residence at Breda in 
north Brabant. In 1555 he held the arm of the ailing Charles V during the 
abdication ceremony; and in 1559 he served as imperial plenipotentiary to 
the Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis. He then went to Paris as one of three 
sureties for the Treaty's implementation. To all appearances he was a pillar 
of the Catholic, imperial Establishment. But in Paris, he heard of Spanish 
plans to subdue the Netherlands; and he contracted a lifelong distaste for 
Spanish machinations. He is known to history as 'William the Silent' (see 
pp. 536-8). 2 

Despite its subsequent Dutch connections, therefore, the House of 
Orange-Nassau, which William founded, was not Dutch in origin. It was a 
typical dynastic multinational amalgam founded by accident and perpetuated 
by good fortune. Of William's three sons only one was to keep the line 
intact. That child was conceived by William's fourth wife in between two 
attempts by Spanish agents to have William murdered. (William had once 
granted a pardon to his adulterous second wife's lover, who then went off to 
father Peter Paul Rubens.) William's great-grandson, also William of Orange 
(1650-1702), who became King William III of England, was born in the 
middle of a Dutch revolution, eight days after his father had died of 
smallpox. 

The Orange Order was founded in Armagh in 1795. Like the earlier 
'Peep o' Day Boys', it aimed to preserve the Protestant (Episcopalian) 
supremacy in Ireland. Its hero was 'King Billy' (William III): its watchword, 
'No Surrender!' At a time when British law discriminated against Catholics 
and Presbyterians alike, the Order saw itself as the shield of an isolated elite 
against the growing popularity of Wolfe Tone's United Irishmen. Tone 
(1763-98), a moderate Protestant, sought the twin goals of universal 
toleration and a sovereign Irish republic. He had appealed for military aid 



from France. 

In the bitter fighting of 1795-8, the Orange Order played a leading part 
in British plans to repel invasion and suppress sedition. Faced by 
incompetent adversaries, it prevailed. The expedition of General Hoche, 
which sailed from Brest in 1796, came to grief in Bantry Bay. The successful 
landing by General Humbert at Killala in County Mayo was short-lived. The 
armed rising in Wicklow and Wexford collapsed after the Battle of Vinegar 
Hill (June 1798). Tone, captured in French naval uniform, committed 
suicide. 

In these and all subsequent events, the Orangemen followed their own 
exclusive agenda. They opposed both the Act of Union (1801) and Daniel 
O'Connell. They were not converted to the Union until the prospect arose 
after 1829 that an autonomous Ireland might be run by emancipated 
Catholics. Yet they rejected mainstream British Unionism. In 1912-14, they 
provided the backbone of the Ulster Volunteers who were training to defy 
Westminster and the Irish Home Rule Bill (see p. 831). Their greatest 
influence was exerted when Northern Ireland ruled itself within the United 
Kingdom from 1920 to 1976. 

For 200 years, the Orange Order has held its annual parades on the 
anniversary of the Boyne (see p. 631). Marchers in bowler hats and orange 
sashes tramp defiantly through Catholic quarters to the whistle and beat of 
fife and drum. And the old toast is raised: 

"To the glorious, pious and immortal memory of the great and good King 
William, who saved us from popery, slavery, knavery, brass money, and 
wooden shoes. And a fig to the Bishop of Cork!" 


The dear old Holy Roman Empire, 

How does it hang together? 

The answer, in the view of a distinguished British historian, lay less in the 
political sphere than in a 'civilisation', a set of shared attitudes and 
sensibilities.- 

The Emperor Rudolf II assembled a court at Prague that really was a 
wonderful curiosity. His chosen companions, the most brilliant artists and 





scientists of the age, were men who took natural and supernatural to be part and 
parcel of their everyday researches. Apart from Kepler, Brahe, Campion, and 
Bruno, Giuseppe Arcimboldo (1537-93) achieved fame as the founder of 
surrealist painting (see Plate 54), and Cornelius Drebber (1572-1633), illusionist 
and opera designer, as inventor of a perpetual-motion machine. Drebber, who 
visited London, promised James I a telescope which could read books at a mile's 
distance. He is thought to have been the model for Prospero, 'rapt in secret 
studies', in Shakespeare's Tempest, just as Rudolf himself may have inspired the 
Duke in Measure for Measure.- Rudolf's fabulous art collection became a 
strategic target of the Swedish army during the latter stages of the Thirty Years' 
War. [ALCHEMIA] [OPERA] 

Spain passed from grandeur to decline in little more than a century. 'For a few 
fabulous decades Spain was to be the greatest power on earth' and 'all but the 
master of Europe.'- Under Charles V/Carlos I (r. 1516-56) it lived through the 
age of the crucero, the conquistadores, and the tercio, there being a clear 
correlation between the supply of American gold and the upkeep of the finest 
army in Europe. Under Philip II (r. 1556-98) it stood at the pinnacle of its 
political and cultural power, until undermined by internal resistance, by the 
hostility of France and England, and by the revolt of the Netherlands. Under 
Philip's successors- Philip III (r. 1598-1621), Philip IV (r. 1621-65), and the 
imbecile Charles II (r. 1665-1700)-it never recovered from a decadent dynasty, 
from noble faction, or from its debilitating involvement in the Thirty Years War. 
The fall was so sudden that Spaniards themselves were apt to wonder: 'was the 
original achievement no more than an engano -an illusion?'- [flamenco] 


ALCHEMIA 

In 1606, the Emperor Rudolph II was the subject of a formal complaint 
drawn up by the Habsburg Archdukes. 'His Majesty', they wrote in their 
Proposition, 'Is only interested in wizards, alchemists, cabbalists and the 
like.' Rudolph's court at Prague did indeed house Europe's most 
distinguished research centre for the occult arts. 1 





In that same year a Hungarian alchemist, Janos Banffy-Hunyadi (1576- 
1641), set out from his native Transylvania. He stopped over at the Court of 
Maurice of Hesse at Cassel, the principal Protestant centre of occultism, 
before moving on to London. 2 His arrival coincided with the death of the 
learned Welshman, Dr John Dee (1527-1608), sometime astrologer to Queen 
Elizabeth I, who once invented the term 'Great Britain' to please his queen 
and who had spent several years both in Prague and in Poland. Such 
'cosmopolitans', as they were called, 'made their careers on the international 
circuit of alchemy, the true predecessor of the later scientific community. 

Europe was experiencing a veritable 'occult revival', in which alchemy 
was the most important of several related 'secret arts'. 'Alchemy', writes the 
historian of Rudolph's world, 'was the greatest passion of the age In Central 
Europe.' 3 It combined the search for the philosopher's stone, which would 
transmute base metals into gold, with the parallel search for the spiritual 
rebirth of mankind. 'What is below is like what is above.' 

Alchemists required expertise across a very wide range of knowledge. To 
conduct their experiments with metals and other substances, they needed to 
be familiar with the latest technology. To interpret their results, they needed 
a sound grasp of astrology, of cabbalistic number theory, of lapidarism, of 
herbalism, and of the 'iatrochemlstry' developed by Paracelsus [holism]. 
Most importantly, in a religious age, they sought to present their findings In 
the language of mystical Christian symbolism. It was no accident that at this 
time the secret Rosicrucian Society, the adepts of 'Rose' and 'Cross', chose 
to come into the open, at Kassel, or that the principal systematizer of 

Rosicrucian theosophy, Robert Fludd, was also a respectable alchemist, 
[CONSPIRO] 

In later scientific times, the alchemists were seen as an aberrant breed 
which long delayed the growth of true knowledge. Indeed, in the so-called 
'Age of the Scientific Revolution' they have sometimes been seen as 'the 
opposition'. The most charitable historian of science calls them practitioners 
of 'technology without science'. 4 Yet in their own eyes, and in the eyes of 
powerful patrons, there was no such distinction. They were 'white wizards' 
fighting for the Good; they were reformers; they were engaged in a quest to 
unlock the secret forces of mind and matter. They would not be overtaken by 
scientists of the modern persuasion until the end of the following century; 
and chemistry did not establish itself until still later, [eldluft ] 5 



The Emperor Rudolph's cosmopolitan alchemists often held responsible 
positions. Several, like Michael Maier, who also worked in London, or the 
Huguenot sympathizer, Nicholas Barnard, held the office of Leibarzt or court 
physician. Others, such as Sebald Schwaertzer, served as imperial controller 
of mines at Rudolfov and Joachimsthal. [dollar] Heinrich Kuhnrath (1560- 
1605), author of the grandiose Amphitheatrum Sapientiae Aeternae 
Christiano-kabalisticum, came from Leipzig. Michal S^dziwoj or 
'Sendivogius' (1566-1636), whose Novum Lumen Chymicum (1604) ran into 
54 editions and would be thoroughly studied by Isaac Newton, came from 
Warsaw. He was connected to the powerful faction of pro-Habsburg 
magnates in Poland, who had contacts with Oxford and who brought John 
Dee to Cracow. John Dee's dubious assistant, Edward Kelley, classed as 
Cacochimicus, probably died in prison in Prague. Their company included 
the ill-fated Giordano Bruno [syrop], the astronomers Kepler and Brahe, and 
an English poetess called Elizabeth Jane Weston. 

There was also a prominent Jewish element. The Chief Rabbi of Prague, 
Judah Loew ben Bezalel (d. 1609), patronized a revival of the [cabala]. It 
was fed by the works of Sephardi writers such as Isaac Luria or Moses 
Cordovero, whose Pardes Rimmonim was published in Cracow in 1591. One 
of the Emperor's closest associates, Mardochaeus the Jew, was a specialist in 
elixirs of fertility. 

For contemporaries, alchemy had the most positive connotations: 

Full many a glorious morning have I seen 
Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye, 

Kissing with golden face the meadows green, 

Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy. 6 


Philip II must be the prototype of all monarchs who have tried to rule 
without rising from their desks (see Plate 43). Austere, penitential, tireless, 
ensconced in a solitary study in the gloomy Escorial on the barren plateau 
outside Madrid, he strove to enforce a spiritual and administrative uniformity 
which the variety of his vast dominions would never permit. He ruled through 
two sets of parallel councils-one set devoted to the main areas of policy, the 
other to the government of six major territorial units. For, in addition to his 
father's Castilian, Aragonese, Italian, Burgundian, and American legacies, in 




1580 he seized his mother's vast Portuguese inheritance. His disregard for the 
rights of the various Diets culminated in the hanging of the Justizar of Aragon. 
Yet the dream of 'one monarch, one empire, one sword' was relentlessly pursued 
under the pretext that the King knew best how to trabajar para el pueblo, 'work 
for his people'.- In the process, he drove his sick, imprisoned son to death; he 
drove the Inquisition to waves of autos-da-fe; and he drove the persecuted 
Moriscos of Granada to rebel in 1568-9, the offended Dutch to rebel in 1566, the 
humiliated Aragonese to rebel in 1591-2. His adversaries, like William the 
Silent, considered him simply 'a murderer and a liar'. Never can an apparently 
sensitive man have so completely ignored the sensitivities of others. Absolute 
master of the Church in Spain, he sought to extirpate the Church's enemies 
across Europe. He swore to avenge his second wife's memory in England. He 
intervened against the Huguenots in France. He wrongly saw the Dutch 
Protestants as the source of all discontent in the Netherlands. But God, like 
Philip II, did not smile on Spain. By the 1590s a general crisis loomed. The 
Great Armada of 1588 had been dashed by storms. The Dutch held out. Plague 
swept the Spanish cities. The countryside, drained by taxes and hit by 
agricultural failures, was beginning to depopulate. The richest coffers in the 
world were empty. In 1596 Philip II was formally bankrupt for the fourth time. 
There was misery amidst splendour, and an overpowering sense of 
disillusionment. Philip, like Don Quixote, had been tilting at windmills. The 
supremacy of Castile was deeply resented by Spain's other constituent 
kingdoms. 'Castile has made Spain,' the epitaph reads, 'and Castile has 
destroyed it.'- [inquisitio] 


OPERA 

The composer called it a favola in musica, 'a fable set to music'. It was 
intended as an imitation of ancient Greek drama, and was produced in 
February 1607 before the Accademia degli Invaghiti in Mantua, probably in 
the Gallery of the Rivers in the ducal palace of the Gonzagas. Its five acts 
consisted of a series of madrigal groups and dances linked by instrumental 
interludes and recitatives. The libretto was written by the poet Alessandro 
Striggio. The music of the infernal scenes was given to trombones, the 





pastorals to flutes and recorders. It culminated in the great tenor aria 
'Possente spirto' at the end of Act III. It was Claudio Monteverdi's Orfeo, 
'the first viable opera in the repertoire'. 1 

Since its origins in the court entertainments of late Renaissance Italy, the 
operatic genre, which combines music, secular drama, and spectacle, has 
passed through many phases. The opera seria, whose most prolific 
proponent was Pietro Metastasio (1698-1782), author of 800 libretti, was 
devoted to classical and historical themes. Alongside it, the opera buffa 
launched a long tradition of light-hearted entertainment leading through 
opera comique to operetta and musical comedy. Grand Opera, which starts in 
the late eighteenth century, reached its peaks in the Viennese, Italian, French, 
German, and Russian schools. Romantic nationalism became a prominent 
ingredient. The supreme laurels are disputed between the lovers of Verdi and 
Puccini and the fanatical acolytes of Richard Wagner. Modernist opera began 
with Debussy's Pelleas et Melisande (1902), the precursor of a rich category 
including Berg's Wozzeck (1925), Britten's Peter Grimes (1945), and 
Stravinsky's Rake's Progress (1951) (see Appendix III, p. 1278). [susanin] 

[TRISTAN] 

The Orphean theme has provided recurrent inspiration. Jacopo Peri's 
Florentine masque Euridice (1600) anticipated Monteverdi's production in 
Mantua. Gluck's Orpheus and Eurydice (1762) opened the classical 
repertoire. Offenbach's Orpheus in the Underworld (1858) is one of the most 
joyous of the standard operettas. Luciano Berio's Opera (1971) puts the 
traditional story to a serial score. 


FLAMENCO 

Andalusian gypsy music in the style now known as flamenco has been 
played and admired since the sixteenth century. The plaintive melodies of 
the cante or 'singing' blend to inimitable effect with the dramatic poses and 
rhythmic stamping of the bade or 'dance'. The dissonances and quarter- 
tones, the exquisitely raucous vocal delivery, and the pulsating guitars and 
castanets contribute to a sound that has no counterpart in Europe's musical 




folklore. 

The history of flamenco turns on three separate features-the name, the 
gypsies, and the music. No scholarly consensus exists about any of them. 1 

Flamenco simply meant 'Flemish'. In the vocabulary of art, it also 
gained the connotation of 'exotic' or 'ornate'. One theory proposes that 
Jewish songs banned by the Inquisition found their way back to Spain from 
Flanders, where many Spanish Jews had taken refuge. Another suggests that 
flamenco derives from the Arabic fellah-mangu or 'singing peasant'. 

Gypsies reached Spain after the expulsions of the Jews and Moors. They 
were known as gitanos or egipcianos. The English traveller and writer 
George Borrow was the first to record in the 1840s that people were calling 
them flamencos. [Romany] 

Andalusia's long tradition of Moorish music dated back to the eighth and 
ninth centuries. The Omeyas of Cordoba were entertained by oriental singers 
accompanied on the lute. One high point was reached in the reign of Abd-er- 
Rahman (r. 821-52) with the arrival of a singer from Baghdad known as 
Zoriab. Another occurred at the Sevillian court of the poet-king Al-Motamit 
(r. 1040-95), where orchestras of more than 100 lutes and flutes are known 
to have performed. In the twelfth century the philosopher Aver-roes said: 
'When a scholar dies in Seville, his books are sold in Cordoba; when a 
musician dies in Cordoba, his instruments are sold in Seville.' 

It would be rash to speculate on Flamenco's links with the earlier 
Moorish music of the region. Europe's gypsies had a strong musical tradition 
of their own, and produced startling results elsewhere-notably in Romania 
and Hungary. How exactly the music and the musicians came together in 
Andalusia is a mystery. The psychological traumas of Andalusia 
undoubtedly set the scene. The ancient flamenco jondo or 'deep flamenco', 
especially the tonas or 'unaccompanied melodies', belong to the world of 
tears and lament. Like the blues of America's deep South, they express the 
black moods of people in despair: they are the songs of the dispossessed. In 
this, they differ markedly from the flamboyant style of flamenco chico, 
'smart flamenco', which swept Spain's cafe life in the 1860s and which 
furthered the romantic 'reinvention' of Andalusia. 'Flamenco Jondo', wrote 
Federico Garcia Lorca, 'is a stammer, a marvellous buccal undulation that 
smashes the resonant cells of our tempered scale, eludes the cold rigid staves 
of modern music, and makes the tightly closed flowers of the semitones 



blossom into a thousand petals.' 2 


After Philip's death the Spanish Habsburgs sought in vain to restore their 
fortunes. A concerted attempt was made to join forces with their Austrian 
relations. Gaspar de Guzman, Count of Oliverez and Duke of San Lucar, 
popularly known as El Conde Duque, the 'Count-Duke', who held the reins of 
policy from 1621 to 1643, applied the principles of earlier Castilian reformers. 
But his career came to grief amidst the shattering secession of Portugal (1640) 
and the revolt of Catalonia (1640-8). Spain's involvement in the Thirty Years 
War ended with the loss of the United Provinces-its richest single asset. The 
interrelated wars with France were protracted until the Treaty of the Pyrenees 
(1659). Overwhelmed by the spiralling costs of war, by the multiplicity of fronts, 
by the absence of any interval of respite, Spain could rescue neither itself nor its 
Austrian partner. Thanks to the extraordinary problems of 'the Spanish Road', 
the logistics of supporting an army in the Low Countries became insuperable. 
Poner una pica en Flandres (putting a pikeman into Flanders) became a Spanish 
idiom for 'attempting the impossible'.- 'The Habsburg bloc', writes the 
historian of political logistics, 'provides one of the greatest examples of 
strategical overstretch in history.'- [picaro] [valtel-lina] 

The Revolt of the Netherlands, which began in 1566 and ended in 1648, 
constituted a long-mnning drama which spanned the transition from the 
supremacy of the Habsburgs to that of France. At the outset, the seventeen 
provinces of the imperial Burgundian Circle that were transferred to Spanish rule 
in 1551 presented a mosaic of local privileges and of social and cultural 
divisions. The feudal aristocracy of the countryside contrasted sharply with the 
wealthy burghers and fishermen of the coastal towns. The francophone and 
predominantly Catholic Walloons of Hainault, Namur, and Liege contrasted with 
the Dutch-speaking and increasingly Calvinist population of Holland, Zeeland, 
and Utrecht. The central provinces of Flanders and Brabant lay across the main 
religious and linguistic divide. Over 200 cities controlled perhaps 50 per cent of 
Europe's trade, bringing Spain seven times more in taxes than the bullion of the 
Indies. Certainly, in the initial stages of Spanish mle, the threat to provincial 
liberties and to the nobles' control of Church benefices gave greater cause for 
popular offence than the threat of activating the Inquisition (see Appendix III, p. 





1275). 


PICARO 

Picaro was the Spanish name given to rogues and vagabonds, that is, to 
people living beyond the margin of settled and respectable society. It was 
also given to a genre of popular literature, the picaresque, which flourished 
across Europe from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries in advance of 
the novel. The archetype of the genre was found in Mateo Aleman's Guzman 
de Alfrache (1599), whose adventures on the road from Seville to Rome in 
the company of a dubious lady-friend ran into twenty-six editions. Guzman 
revealed how the brotherhood of beggars formed a mutual protection society, 
revelling in their ingenious schemes to cheat the governing classes. 

But Guzman was one among many. In Spain, a certain Lazarillo had 
appeared half a century earlier. In Germany, the practical joker Till 
Eulenspiegel was well known before he first made it into print. In 1523 
Luther wrote a preface to the much-reprinted Liber Vagatorum, which 
contains a description of twenty-eight categories of tramp. Simplicissimus, 
the ex-soldier of the Thirty Years War who wandered round the world, was 
the creation of H. J. C. von Grimmelshausen in 1669. In France, after 
numerous earlier appearances, Gil Bias emerged from the pen of Le Sage in 
1715. In Italy, there appeared // vagabondo (1621). In England, many minor 
references to roguery from Chaucer onwards culminated in John Gay's 
sensationally popular The Beggar's Opera of 1728. 1 

Picaresque literature was clearly responding to a widespread social 
condition. Vagabondage and beggary filled a large social space, midway 
between the medieval forest outlaws and the regimented urban poor of the 
nineteenth century. It was spawned by the disintegration of hierarchical rural 
society, and encouraged by social policing that combined ferocious 
punishments with highly incompetent enforcement. Men and women took to 
the road in droves because they were unemployed, because they were 
fugitives from justice, above all because they longed to escape the 
oppressive, dependent status of serfs and servants. The picaro was wild but 
free. 




Vagabonds sought protection in numbers, and in social hierarchies of 
their own. They travelled in bands with families and children, some of them 
mutilated to excite pity. They had specialized guilds of pickpockets, thieves, 
burglars, pedlars, beggars, cripples real and feigned, jugglers, entertainers, 
fortune-tellers, tinkers, whores, washerwomen, chaplains, and musicians- 
each with rules and guardians. They even developed their own secret 
language, known as rotwelsch or zargon. They gathered intermittently for 
meetings and 'parliaments', where they elected their 'kings' and 'queens'; 
and they shared the roads with gypsy tribes and gangs of unpaid soldiery: 

Hark, hark! the dogs do bark. 

The beggars are coming to town. 

Some in rags, and some in tags, 

And some in a velvet gown. 

Social provision for vagrancy was minimal. Only the richest cities could 
afford charitable refuges-such as those at Bruges from 1565, Milan from 
1578, and Lyons from 1613. In any case, 'charity' could be an ill-disguised 
euphemism for repression. In 1612, when the city of Paris asked its 8- 
10,000 vagrants to assemble on the Place St Germain to receive assistance, 
only 91 persons came forward, [folly] 

Ferocious legislation underlined the authorities' impotence. In 
Elizabethan England, for example, every parish was given the right to brand 
'sturdy beggars' on the shoulder with a letter R for 'rogue', to flog the 
homeless and to send them 'home': in effect to condemn them 'to be 
whipped from parish to parish'. Georgian England made an attempt to 
distinguish 'the deserving poor'. At the same time, the Black Waltham Act 
of 1713 let suspected highwaymen and their accomplices be hanged without 
trial. In practice, most countries could only keep vagrancy down by periodic 
military expeditions into the countryside, where exemplary hangings and 
press-gangings took place. In Eastern Europe vagrancy was conditioned by a 
harsher climate and by the persistence of serfdom. But fugitive serfs were a 
common phenomenon. In Russia the yurodiv or itinerant 'holy fool' was 
traditionally the recipient of hospitality and charity-proof too, perhaps, of 
more Christian social attitudes. 2 


Under the regency of Margaret of Parma, 1559-67, discontent came to a 




head over a scheme for ecclesiastical reform. Three protesters-William the 
Silent, Prince of Orange (1533-84), Lamoral, Count of Egmont, and Philip 
Montmorency, Count of Horn-petitioned the King with the Regent's 
permission. They were ridiculed as Geuzen, les Gueux, The Beggars', and in 
1565, in the Edict of Segovia, Philip indicated his refusal to authorize change. 
Following further petitions for reform, and a meeting in 1566 of confederated 
nobles at St Trond, which demanded religious toleration, there occurred a serious 
outbreak of rioting and religious desecrations. The action of the confederates in 
helping the Regent to quell the disorders did not deter Philip from ordering 
general repression. Under the regency of the Duke of Alva, 1567-73, a Council 
of Tumults, the notorious Bloedraad or 'Blood-Council' was set up to try the 
King's opponents. Egmont and Horn were beheaded in the square at Brussels, 
their severed heads sent to Madrid in a box. William of Orange escaped to lead 
the continuing fight. With the whole population of the Netherlands condemned 
to death as heretics by the Church, the south rebelled as well as the north. The 
'Sea Beggars' attacked shipping. Haarlem, besieged, capitulated. Spanish 
garrisons spread fire and plunder. Thousands perished from random arrests, 
mock trials, and casual violence. 


VALTELLINA 

In July 1620 a bloody massacre took place in a remote alpine valley-the 
Valtellina or Veltlin. The Catholic faction in the valley fell on their 
Protestant neighbours and, with the aid of a Spanish force from Milan, killed 
as many as they could seize. This Veltlinermord, at the outset of the Thirty 
Years War, alerted the Powers to the Valtellina's strategic potential. 

The Valtellina lies on the southern side of the Bernina section of the 
main alpine ridge. It was formed by the River Adda, and runs some 74 miles 
due eastwards from the tip of Lake Como, then north-east to the old Roman 
spa at Bormio. An important side-valley, the Val di Poschiavo, leads 
northwards via the Bernia Pass to St Moritz. The main valley leads over the 
Stelvio Pass or Stilfserjoch (9,055 feet) to southern Tyrol. In 1520 the shrine 
of the Madonna di Tirano was built where the main road crosses a north- 
south track leading down the Val di Poschiavo and over into the Val 




Camonica. In 1603 a Spanish fortress was built to command the entrance to 
the valley from Lake Como. A string of villages on the sunny northern 
terraces of the Adda are famed for their chestnuts, figs, honey, and aromatic 
'Retico' wine. 1 (See Appendix III, p. 1219.) 

It was political geography, however, that was crucial. By the 1600s 
almost all the transalpine routes were controlled by the Duke of Savoy, by 
the Swiss Confederation, or by the Republic of Venice. When the Austrian 
Habsburgs were looking for support from their Spanish relatives in Italy, the 
Valtellina had become the sole accessible corridor between the two main 
blocks of Habsburg territory. Indeed, since the sea-lanes between Spain and 
the Netherlands were increasingly threatened by Dutch and English 
warships, the Valtellina became the last sure route for sending gold and 
troops from Spain and Spanish Italy to the empire. It was the jugular vein of 
the Habsburgs' body politic. 

Yet the columns of marching pikemen, and the mule trains loaded with 
pieces of eight, remained extremely vulnerable. They were not welcome to 
the local inhabitants, many of whom had turned to Calvinism; they were 
open to direct attack from the Swiss Freestate of the Graubunden or Grisons, 
via the Val di Poschiavo; and they were subject to the changing fortunes of 
complicated proprietorial disputes. Both the Habsburgs and the Grisons had 
inherited claims to the Valtellina rooted in the medieval wrangles between 
the Visconti dukes of Milan and the bishops of Chur. Not to be outdone, the 
French reckoned that Charlemagne had granted the Valtellina in perpetuity to 
the Abbey of St Denis. 

After 1620, the valley became the focus of Richelieu's diplomacy with 
Venice, Switzerland, and Savoy. Five times in the next twenty years it saw 
French and Spanish garrisons change places. In 1623 and in 1627 it was 
handed over during arbitration to papal forces. In 1623-5 it was taken by the 
Grisons. In 1633 and 1635-7 it was taken by French forces under the 
Huguenot Duke of Rohan. But the French so offended their Protestant allies 
that a local pastor, George Jenatsch, changed sides, called in the Spaniards, 
and converted to Roman Catholicism. By then, having laid hands on the 
Rhine, the French could safely leave the Valtellina to its Catholic and, 
ultimately, to its Italian destiny. After a generation of turmoil the valley 
could return to its vines, to the production of Sassella, Grumello, Valgella, 
Montagna, and the orange-coloured dessert wine, the Sfurzat. 



Under the governorships of Don Luis de Requesens, Grand Commander of 
Castile 1573-6, and of Don John of Austria 1576-8 reconciliation was attempted 
but failed. Leyden, besieged, survived. The sack of Antwerp during the Spanish 
Fury of 1576 hardened resistance. Under the regency of the Duke of Parma 
1578-92, the split became irreversible. By the Union of Arras (1578) ten 
southern provinces accepted Spanish terms and recovered their liberties. By the 
Union of Utrecht (1579) the seven northern provinces resolved to fight for their 
independence. Thereafter, there was unremitting war. Spanish military resources 
could never be brought to bear against the Dutchmen's dykes, their money, 
warships, and allies. In 1581-5 and 1595-8 the Dutch were assisted by the 
French, in 1585-7 by the English under the Earl of Leicester. In 1609 they 
enjoyed an eleven-year truce, but were forced to fight on from 1621 to 1648 in 
the ranks of the anti-imperial coalition. Their steadfastness prevailed. The spirit 
of a new nation was inscribed on the front of a burgher's house in Zijlstraat, 
Haarlem: 'int soet nederland; ick blyf getrou; ick wyct nyet af' (To the dear 
Netherlands. I shall be true. I shall not waver.)- 

The Dutch Republic of the 'United Provinces of the Netherlands'- 
misleadingly known in English as Holland-was the wonder of seventeenth- 
century Europe. It succeeded for the same reasons that its would-be Spanish 
masters failed: throughout the eighty years of its painful birth, its disposable 
resources were actually growing. Having resisted the greatest military power of 
the day, it then became a major maritime power in its own right. Its sturdy 
burgher society widely practised the virtues of prudent management, democracy, 
and toleration. Its engineers, bankers, and sailors were justly famed. Its 
constitution (1584) ensured that the governments of the seven provinces 
remained separate from a federal council of state at The Hague. The latter was 
chaired by an executive Stadholder, whose office was generally held, together 
with the offices of Captain-General and Admiral-General, by the House of 
Orange, [orange] 

The Dutch Republic rapidly became a haven for religious dissidents, for 
capitalists, for philosophers, and for painters. The earlier Flemish school of 
Rubens (1577-1640) and Van Dyck (1599-1641) was surpassed by the Dutch 
School of Hals, Ruysdael, Vermeer, and, above all, of Rembrandt (Harmenszoon 
van Rijn, 1609-66). Nor were the Netherlands blighted by bourgeois dullness. 
Its religious affairs were enlivened by the Arminian controversy, its military 



affairs by a vocal element of pacifist opinion, its politics by a party of extreme 
republicans who in 1651-72, under Jan de Witt (1625-72), succeeded in keeping 
the Stadholdership vacant. Its political power began to wane with the three 
English wars of 1651-4, 1665-7, and 1672-4. Even so, despite its peculiar, 
decentralised constitution, it had every reason to regard itself as the first modern 
State.- [BATAVIA] 

France, too, was entering a period of renewed vigour and splendour. Less 
encumbered by distant colonies, and geographically more compact, she was a 
worthy rival for the Habsburgs. Yet France was strategically encircled, by the 
Empire on one side and by Spain on the other, by the Spanish Netherlands in the 
north and by the Spanish Mediterranean possessions in the south. The French 
were repeatedly thwarted in their attempts to reach the dominant position to 
which they felt entitled. 

In the century-and-a-half which separated Renaissance France from Louis 
XIV, French kings repeatedly ran into strangulating complications both at home 
and abroad. Charles VIII launched the Italian wars in 1494, in romantic pursuit 
of the Angevin claim to Naples, only to embroil his country in a series of titanic 
conflicts lasting 65 years. Louis XII (r. 1498-1515), Pere de son Peuple and heir 
to the Visconti, did likewise by pursuing his claim to Milan. Francis I (r. 1515- 
47), born at Cognac, a magnificent knight, cultivated man of pleasure, and 
Renaissance prince par excellence, met his first setback at the imperial election 
of 1519 and the second by his capture at Pavia in 1525. 'Tout est perdu,' he 
wrote to his mother, 'fors l'honneur et la vie.' His release, and marriage to the 
Emperor's sister, did not restrain him from persisting with the Franco-German 
feud that henceforth gripped Europe for the rest of modern history. He was a 
prince of wide horizons: patron of Jacques Cartier's expedition to Canada, as of 
Rabelais, Leonardo, Cellini; founder alike of Le Havre and of the College de 
France; builder of Chambord, Saint-Germain, Fontainebleau, [alcofribashnez] 

[TORMENTA] 

In the reigns of the last four Valois-Henry II (r. 1547-59), Francis II (r. 
1559-60), the youthful Charles IX (r. 1560-74), and the flagrant Henry III (r. 
1574-89)-France gained respite from the Habsburg conflict at the Peace of 
Cateau-Cambresis (1559), only to sink into the appalling morass of the Wars of 
Religion (see above). The cynical Bourbon Henry IV (r. 1589-1610) saved 
France from religious discord and, with his visionary minister, the Due de Sully 
(1560-1641), prepared plans both for the restoration of prosperity and for 


international peace. There will be no labourer in my kingdom 5 , he promised, 
'without a chicken in his pot.' Like his predecessor, he was cut down by an 
assassin, [dessein] 


BATAVIA 

In the mid-seventeenth century, several travellers to Amsterdam recorded 
their astonishment at the 'drowning cell' which they had seen, or heard 
about, in the city's house of correction. In order to teach idle young men to 
work, the candidates for correction would be cast into a sealed cellar 
furnished only with a mnning tap and a hand-pump. Whenever they stopped 
working the pump, they were faced with the imminent prospect of drowning. 
This installation was a wonderful metaphor for the physical predicament of 
the Dutch Republic and its dykes. It is also a fine illustration of the country's 
'moral geography'-what has been called 'the Batavian Temperament'. 1 

The Dutch Republic in its heyday was famous for its commerce, for its 
cities, for its seapower, for its canals, windmills, and tulips, for its art, for its 
religious tolerance, for its black-and-white cattle, and for the puritanical 
culture of its burgher elite. The picture is true enough. But it provokes two 
major questions. One concerns the ambiguities which abound in the 
interplay of the component parts, the other concerns the miracle of how it all 
happened in the first place-'how a modest assortment of farming, fishing 
and shipping communities, with no shared language, religion or government, 
transformed itself into a world empire'. A leading historian of the subject 
stresses that the miracle was not the work of a class, but of a precocious 
'community of the nation'. 2 

The central paradox of Dutch culture lies in the strange contradiction 
between its frugal, hard-working, God-fearing ethos and its 'embarrassing' 
storehouse of riches. The sober, dark-suited Dutch burghers loved feasting, 
adored tobacco, built sumptuous houses, furnished them lavishly, collected 
paintings, indulged in the vanity of portraiture, and amassed money. Sexual 
relations were relaxed. Family life was companionable rather than 
patriarchal. Women, by the standards of the time, were liberated, and 




children were cherished. The accepted practice for raising funds to help the 
poor was to organize a municipal lottery or an auction of gold, jewels, and 
silverware. 

Over it all there reigned an inimitable freedom of spirit. It was accepted 
that wealth and security could only be gained by those who were game for 
the risk: 

Here lies Isaac le Maire, merchant, who during his affairs throughout the 
world, by the grace of God, has known much abundance and has lost in 
thirty years (excepting his honour) over 150,000 guilders. Died as a 
Christian 30 September 1624. 3 

Much of these matters were well known to Dutch scholars. But the task of 
recreating this distinctive mentalite for the world at large fell to a British 
scholar of Dutch-Jewish parentage. It has reopened the vexed question of 
whether national character really exists or not. 


The long reign of Louis XIII (r. 1610-43) and the minority of his son, Louis 
XIV (1643-51), were overshadowed by the long careers of two formidable 
churchmen-Armand Duplessis, Cardinal de Richelieu (1585-1642) and Giulio 
Mazzarini, Cardinal Mazarin (1602-61). External affairs were entirely 
preoccupied with the Thirty Years War, internal affairs with the assertion of 
centralized royal power against the privileges of the provinces and the nobility. 
The Estates-General was suspended after the session of 1614. The merciless 
attack by Richelieu on the sources of noble wealth and power in the provinces 
underlay the desperate rebellions and the Wars of the Fronde, in 1648-53. The 
sunrise of Louis XIV's mature years burst from very cloudy skies. 


ALCOFRIBAS 


The works of Francois Rabelais, ex-monk, ex-lawyer, and physician, form 
one of the richest mines of literary and historical treasure that early modern 





Europe can offer. But their eccentricity aroused the suspicions of an 
intolerant age, and were first published under the anagrammic pseudonym of 
Alcofribas Nasier. Studies by Lucien Febvre and of Mikhail Bakhtin 
illustrate the breadth of scholarly interest which they still arouse. 

Febvre, co-founder of Annales, was drawn to Rabelais after learning that 
specialists were leaning to the notion that the inventor of Pantagruel and 
Gargantua had been a secret and militant atheist. Having invented the 
community of Theleme, whose only rule was Fais ce que voudras ('Do 
whatever you would like'), no one could claim that Rabelais was a 
conventional religious thinker. On the other hand, to charge him with 
subversion of Christianity was a serious matter. Febvre, in response, 
produced one of the great surveys of 'collective mentality': Le Probleme de 
Vincroyance au XVI e siecle (1942). Having examined all the charges of 
scandal, and all the possible sources of irregular belief, in radical 
Protestantism, science, philosophy, and the occult, he concluded that 
Rabelais had shared 'the deep religiosity' of 'a century which wanted to 
believe'. 1 

Bakhtin, a distinguished Russian Dostoevskian scholar, turned to 
Rabelais from an interest in psychology. Rabelais has had the reputation of 
being the master of the vulgar belly-laugh [nez]. But he also enters that 
profounder realm where laughter mingles with tears. Bakhtin emerged with a 
hypothesis centred on Rabelais's famous proposition that 'laughter is the 
mark of humanity'. 'To laugh is human, to be human is to laugh.' Mieux est 
de rire que de larmes ecrire. Pour ce que rire est le propre de Vhomme. 

But Bakhtin suspects that modern civilization has seriously repressed 
this most human of qualities. Europeans, since Rabelais, have grown so 
inhibited that they only laugh at trivia. Indeed, they no longer know what is 
sacred in order to laugh at it. It is a profoundly pessimistic opinion parallel 
to the social analysis of Michel Foucault. One is left wondering whether 
Rabelais was not the last European to be truly human. 2 [caritas] 


NEZ 




In 1532 Rabelais described an imaginary duel of gestures between his 
fictional hero, Panurge, and an Englishman: 

Then the Englishe man made this sign. His left hand all open he lifted into the aire, then ... instantly 
shut the foure fingers thereof, and his thumb extended at length he placed upon the gristle of his nose. 
Presently, he lifted up his right hand all open, putting the thumb [beside] the little finger of his left 
hand; and the foure right hand fingers he softly moved in the aire. Then contrarily, he did with the 
right what he had done with the left, and with the left what he had done with the right. 

According to a recent study, 'thumbing the nose' or 'cocking a snoot' is 
the most widespread of all European gestures. It conveys mockery. In France 
it is known as le pied de nez or 'fool's nose', in Italy as marameo or 
'mewing', in Germany as die lange Nase, in Portugal as tocar tromfete 'to 
blow the trumpet', in Serbo-Croat as sviri ti svode 'to play the flute'. It is 
more common and less ambiguous than the Fingertips Kiss, the Temple 
Screw, the Eyelid Pull, the Forearm Jerk, the Ring, the Fig, the Nose Tap, 
and the V-sign-all of which have important regional and contextual 
variations. 1 

It is debatable whether there is a culture of gestures exclusive to Europe 
or to Christendom. But there is no doubt that gestures change over time. The 
English, who literally refused to kowtow in China, also abandoned bowing 
at home in the late eighteenth century, inventing the handshake as an easier 
form of sexless and classless greeting. 'A l'anglaise done', said Madame 
Bovary in 1857 when offered a gentleman's hand. In the twentieth century, 
however, the English became much more obstinately reticent, frequently 
refusing to shake hands while Continentals did so routinely. 2 They stand at 
the opposite end of the European spectrum to the Poles, whose readiness to 
bow, to embrace both sexes, and to kiss hands in public has survived two 
world wars, modernization, Fascism, and even Communism. 


The Italian Wars have often been used as the starting-point of modern 
history, and as the model of a local conflict which became internationalized. 
(They were neither.) When French troops crossed the pass of Montgenevre in 
September 1494 bound for Naples, they did so by express agreement of the 
Empire, which had been compensated in advance with Franche-Comte, and of 
Aragon, which had been bought off with the gift of Roussillon. So the conflict 




had been 'internationalized' from the start. The result was three French 
expeditions, each of which provoked a powerful coalition to defeat it. The 
expedition of Charles VIII 1494-5, after sweeping triumphantly through Milan, 
Florence, and Rome, captured Naples; but it was forced to retreat with the same 
speed. The expedition of Louis XII, 1499-1515, captured Milan in similar style 
-using Leonardo's equestrian statue for target practice; but it aroused the 
opposition of the Holy League raised by Pope Julius II. The expedition of 
Francis I 1515-26 began with the stunning victory of Marignano which, among 
other things, turned the Swiss to permanent neutrality and persuaded the Pope to 
sign the Concordat of 1516. But it was interrupted by the bitterness of the 
imperial election, which turned Francis I and Charles V into mortal enemies. At 
Pavia in 1525 Marignano was avenged and Francis I taken prisoner. Imperial 
forces pressed on through Provence as far as Marseilles. After his release, 
Francis persuaded a new Pope to form a new Holy League against an over- 
mighty Emperor. The fearful Sack of Rome by imperial troops ensued in 1527, 
this time with the Pope made captive. By then the Italian Wars had become 
simply one front of a generalized Franco-imperial struggle. 


TORMENTA 


At the Midsummer's Fair in mid-sixteenth-century Paris, cat-burning was a 
regular attraction. A special stage was built so that a large net containing 
several dozen cats could be lowered onto the bonfire beneath. The 
spectators, including kings and queens, shrieked with laughter as the 
animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted, and finally carbonized. 
Cruelty was evidently thought to be funny. 1 It played its part in many of 
Europe's more traditional sports, including cock-fighting, bear-baiting, bull¬ 
fighting, and fox-hunting, [ludi] 

Two hundred years later, on 2 March 1757, Robert Francois Damiens 
was condemned in Paris 'to make honourable amends': 


He was brought in a tumbril, naked except for a smock, and carrying a torch 
of burning wax in his hand. The scaffold stood on the Place de Greve. 
Pincered at the breasts, arms, thighs and calves, his right hand holding the 




knife, with which he perpetrated the said act, he was to be burned on the 
hand with sulphur, to be doused at the pinion points with boiling oil, molten 
lead, and burning resin, and then to be dismembered by four horses, before 
his body was burned, reduced to ashes, and scattered to the winds. 

When the fire was lit, the heat was so feeble that only the skin on the 
back of one hand was damaged. But then one of the executioners, a strong 
and robust man, grasped the metal pincers, each 1 1/2 feet long, and by 
twisting and turning them, tore out huge lumps of flesh, leaving gaping 
wounds which were doused from a red-hot spoon. 

Between his screams, Damiens repeatedly called out, 'My God, take pity 
on me!' and 'Jesus, help me!' The spectators were greatly edified by the 
compassion of an aged cure who lost no moment to console him. 

The Clerk of the Court, the Sieur de Breton, went up to the sufferer 
several times, and asked him if he had anything to say. He said no ... 

The final operation lasted a very long time, because the horses were not 
used to it. Six horses were needed; but even they were not enough ... 

The executioner asked whether they should cut him in pieces, but the 
Clerk ordered them to try again. The confessors drew close once more, and 
he said 'Kiss me, sires', and one of them kissed him on the forehead. 

After two or three more attempts, the executioners took out knives, and 
cut off his legs... They said that he was dead. But when the body had been 
pulled apart, the lower jaw was still moving, as if to speak ... In execution of 
the decree, the last pieces of flesh were not consumed until 10.30 in the 
evening... 2 

Damiens was being punished for attempted regicide. His immediate family 
were banished from France; his brothers and sisters were ordered to change 
their names; and his house was razed. He had approached Louis XV as the 
King was entering his carriage, and he had inflicted a small wound with a 
small knife. He made some sort of complaint about the Parlement. He made 
no attempt to escape, and said that he only wanted to give the King a fright. 
Nowadays, he would be assessed as a crank. 

Torture had been an established feature both of legal proceedings and of 
executions since Roman times. St Augustine recognized its fallibility, but 
admitted its necessity. Torture at executions was thought to have a didactic 
purpose. Death was the least part of the penalty when the convict was to be 



impaled, disembowelled, burned at the stake, or broken on the wheel, [vlad] 

Damiens's death was the last of its kind in France. The Enlightenment 
did not approve. Shortly afterwards a Milanese, the Marquis Cesare 
Beccaria-Bonesana (1735-94), published a tract, Dei delitti i delle pene ('On 
Crimes and Punishment', 1764). It argued that torture was both improper and 
ineffective. Translated into many languages, with a preface by Voltaire, it 
was the catalyst of reform across Europe. It is widely seen as the starting- 
point of a long progressive trend which was to press first for humane 
methods of execution, and eventually for the abolition of the death penalty. 
The 'cruelty curve' was to decline until liberal opinion held that torture 
degrades, not the tortured, but the torturer and the torturer's masters. But that 

was not the whole story. And torture in Europe did not come to an end. 4 
[ALCOFRIBAS] 


The Franco-imperial wars assumed Continental proportions. In his attempt to 
break imperial encirclement, Francis I did not hesitate to recruit allies from all 
quarters. In 1519, he stood in person as candidate for Emperor. Despite the 
abortive meeting at the splendiferous Field of Cloth of Gold, he eventually won 
Henry VIII of England's sympathies. He laid scandalous plans with the 
Protestant princes of Germany; and in 1536, in the famous Capitulations, he 
made common cause with the Infidel, Suleiman the Magnificent, and with the 
Sultan's North African vassals, including the corsair-king Kair-el-Din 
Barbarossa. In the shifting permutations of Italy he was supported both by the 
Popes and by the Vatican's chief opponent, the Republic of Venice. 

The result was four more wars. In 1521-6 the imperialists first attacked 
French Burgundy, before concentrating on the Italian campaign which ended 
with Pavia and the Treaty of Madrid (1526). In 1526-9 the Emperor 
overstretched and disgraced himself, signing the Ladies' Peace at Cambrai 
(1529). In 1536-8 and 1542-4 he was embroiled with the Turks and the German 
Protestants as well as the French, and was constrained to sign the Treaty of 
Crepy-en-Valois (1544), which created an interval permitting the opening of the 
Council of Trent, and the long-delayed attack on the Schmalkaldic League. In 
1551-9, under Henry II, the French conspired with the German Protestants to 
occupy the three archbishoprics of Lorraine-Metz, Toul, and Verdun-thereby 
launching the 'March to the Rhine' and a frontier struggle not ended till 1945. 




(See Appendix III, p. 1281.) The Habsburgs responded in the Low Countries 
with the occupation of Artois, and with an English alliance that instantly inspired 
the French to forget their religious differences and to capture Calais (7 January 
1558). Mary Tudor, whose proxy marriage to Philip II was the price of this brief 
Habsburg-Tudor rapprochement, exclaimed: 'When I die, you will find Calais 
engraved on my heart. 5 By the general peace of Cateau-Cambresis, France kept 
Lorraine and Calais, the Habsburgs kept Artois, Milan, and Naples. England was 
shut out of the Continent for good. The main issue was postponed, not solved. 

[NOSTRADAMUS] 

The British Isles, increasingly dominated by the English, were taken closer to the 
unification which had beckoned once or twice already. Having lost its foothold 
on the Continent, the Kingdom of England turned its energies into the affairs of 
its immediate neighbours and into overseas ventures. A typical composite polity 
of the era, consisting of England, Wales, and Ireland, it lacked the national 
cohesion which Scotland already possessed. But under the Tudors it manifested 
great vigour. Notwithstanding the religious conflicts of the age, Henry VIII (r. 
1509-47) and his three children-Edward VI (r. 1547-53), Mary I (r. 1553-8), 
and Elizabeth (r. 1558-1603)-created the Church of England, the lasting 
symbiosis of monarchy and Parliament, and the Royal Navy, [bard] 

The Stuarts, who had ruled in Scotland since 1371, accepted the Personal 
Union of Scotland and England (1603) after the Tudors ran out of heirs. They 
had much to gain. Deceived by its Continental alliances, Scotland had lived in 
England's shadow since the bloody disaster of Flodden Field (1513). Anglo- 
Scottish relations were badly shaken by the intrigues of the deposed Mary, 
Queen of Scots (1542-87), who died on an English scaffold. But Mary's son, 
James I and VI (r. I567(1603)-1625), succeeded by general consent to the 
inheritance which had escaped his mother. He, his son Charles I (r. 1625-49), 
and his grandson Charles II (r. 1649(60)-85), ruled from Holyrood and from 
Whitehall in parallel. James I talked to his first Parliament at Westminster of 


NOSTRADAMUS 


The royal summons arrived at Salon in Provence early in July 1556. The 




Queen of France, Marie de' Medici, wished to speak to the author of a book 
of prophecies published the previous year. One of its verses appeared to 
predict the death of the Queen's husband: 

Le lion jeune le vieux surmontera 

(The young lion will overcome the older one) 

En champ bellique par singulier duelle. 

(In a field of combat, in single fight.) 

Dans caige d'or lesyeux lui crevera. 

(He will pierce his eyes in their golden cage.) 

Deux classes une, puis mourir, mort cruelle. 

(Two wounds in one, then he dies a cruel death.) 1 

Within a month, speeded by royal horses, the author was ushered into the 
Queen's presence at St Germain-en-Laye. He calmed her fears by saying that 
he saw four kings among her four sons. 

But three years later King Henri II was killed in a tournament. The 
splintered lance of his opponent, Montgomery, Captain of the Scottish 
Guard, had split the visor of the King's gilded helmet, piercing eye and 
throat, and inflicting wounds which caused death after ten days of agony. 

Michel de Nostredame (1503-66), called Nostradamus, was well known 
in the Midi as an unconventional healer. He came from a family of Jewish 
conversos at St Remy-en-Provence, and had graduated in medicine at 
Montpellier. He was learned in potions and remedies, concocting an elixir of 
life for the Bishop of Carcassonne and a diet of quince jelly for the Papal 
Legate. He worked in plague-stricken Marseilles and Avignon when all other 
doctors had left, refusing to bleed patients as was customary, and insisting on 
fresh air and clean water. More than once, as a suspected wizard, he attracted 
the notice of the Inquisition and fled abroad. On one such journey in the 
1540s he is said to have met a young Italian monk and former shepherd, 
Felice Peretti, whom he addressed without hesitation as 'Your Holiness'. 
Forty years later, long after Nostradamus's death, Peretti was elected Pope as 
Sextus V. 

The prophecies of Nostradamus were composed late in life with the help 
of magical, astrological, and cabalistic books. They were written in quatrains 
and organized in centuries. They were published in two parts, in 1555 and 
1568, and were an immediate sensation. One year after their full publication, 



Marie de' Medici's eldest son, King Francis II, husband to Mary Queen of 
Scots, died suddenly at the age of 17 years, 10 months, and 15 days: 

Premier fils, veuve, malheureux manage 
(The first son, a widow, an unhappy marriage) 

Sans nul enfant; deux isles en discorde, 

(Without children; two islands in discord,) 

Avant dixhuit incompetant eage 
(Before eighteen years of age, a minor) 

De l 'autre pres plus bas sera l ' accord . 

(Still younger than the other will be betrothed.) 2 

In that same year the youngest brother, later Charles IX, aged 11, was 
betrothed to an Austrian princess. 

This posthumous success ensured the reputation of the Prophecies for all 
time. They have been endlessly reprinted, and applied to almost every 
known event, from submarines and ICBMs to the deaths of the Kennedys 
and men on the moon. Nostradamus correctly named the family Saulce, 
where Louis XVI lodged during the flight to Varennes. He convinced both 
Napoleon and Hitler, who figures as 'Hister', that their careers had been 
foreseen in the stars. The quatrains are wonderfully suggestive and obscure, 
and can be made to fit all manner of coincidences. But many come too close 
for comfort: 

Quand la licture du tourbillon versee 
(When the litters are overturned by whirlwind) 

Et seront faces de leurs manteaux couvers 
(And faces will be covered by cloaks) 

La Republique pars gens nouveaux vexee 
(The Republic will be troubled by new people.) 

Lors blancs et rouges jugeront a Penvers. 

(At that time, Whites and Reds will rule inside out.) 3 

In 1792 the Republic did arrive in France, and the Reds did overturn the 
Whites. 

And, as a short description of life in the twentieth century, the following 
is uncanny: 

Les fleaux passees diminue le monde. 



(Plagues extinguished, the world becomes smaller.)

BARD 

Shakespeare wrote his plays in the short interval after post-Reformation 
England had severed her direct links with the Continent but before she had 
acquired an overseas empire. His main dramas were written in the same 
decades when the first English colonies were being founded in America. His 
voice was to reign supreme in the English-speaking world, and, as far as one 
knows, he never set foot outside England. The universality of his genius 
would not be generally recognized in Europe until the Romantic era. 

Yet the settings of the plays suggest that the Swan of Avon was in no 
way a Little Englander. He may even have been a secret Catholic. The Tudor 
censorship may well have inhibited politically sensitive material. Yet of 
thirty-seven titles, only ten were set in whole or in part in England; and the 
historical series has a strong admixture of French locations. The Merry Wives 
is set in Windsor, As You Like It in the Forest of Arden. The three dark 
stories of Macbeth, King Lear, and Cymbeline are placed in ancient Celtic 
Britain; and eight classical dramas in Athens, Rome, Tyre, or Troy. The 
fantastic fables of Twelfth Night, A Winter's Tale, and The Tempest unfold in 
a mythical Illyria, in a sea-girt Bohemia, and on 'an uninhabited island'. But 
the rest are manifestly Continental:

The countries which Shakespeare avoids are Ireland, Russia, which was 
barely known, Poland, except for passing references in Hamlet, Germany, 
and England's prime enemy in his day, Spain and the Spanish Netherlands. 

As for where exactly these countries lay, Shakespeare, like his 
contemporaries, was in two minds. Sir John Falstaff wanted to describe 
himself as 'the most active fellow in Europe'. But Petrucchio, wooing the 
Shrew, calls her 'The prettiest Kate in Christendom'. 1 'Christendom' and 
'Europe' were still virtually interchangeable. 


England and Scotland now in the... fullness of time united... in my Person, alike lineally descended of both 
the Crowns, whereby it has now become like a little World within itself, being fortified round about with a 
natural, and yet admirable, pond or ditch ... 


The integration of the dependent principalities did not proceed so smoothly. 
Wales, which was shired by Henry VIII, entered the community of English 
government without demur. The Anglo-Welsh gentry were reasonably content 
with their lot. But Ireland, whose parliament had virtually broken free of English 
control since the Wars of the Roses, was only reined in with difficulty. In 1541- 
after both the Church of England and the counties of Wales had come into being 
in 1534-Henry VIII declared himself 'King of Ireland'. He was storing up 
trouble for his successors. The policy of turning Irish chiefs into Earls and 
Barons was little more than a palliative, especially when Irish customs and 
language were curtailed. Resentment against the Crown was soon mixed with 
resentment against the Protestant Reformation, fuelling a series of revolts. The 
Nine Years' War, 1592-1601, was waged round the Ulster Rising of Hugh 
O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone. It closed amidst the devastating reprisals of Queen 
Elizabeth's lieutenant, Lord Mountjoy, who removed the distinction between the 
Pale and the native lands, abolished Irish law, and started a policy of systematic 
colonization. A prosperous decade of reconciliation in the 1630s under the Earl 
of Strafford was to be followed by a further insurrectionary decade in the 1640s, 




when the Irish profited from England's troubles to introduce religious toleration 
and an independent parliament. Ireland was brutally conquered by Cromwell in 
1649-51, and effectively annexed. (See Appendix III, p. 1279.) [blarney] 

England's power and prosperity were visibly on the increase, not least 
through its oceanic adventures. The new colony in Ulster was largely peopled by 
Scots Presbyterians, seeking the same sort of refuge offered by the English 
colonies across the Atlantic, in Virginia and New England. The foundation of 
Maryland (1632) was followed by Jamaica, which was seized from Spain in 
1655, the Carolinas (1663), New York, formerly Dutch New Amsterdam (1664), 
and New Jersey (1665). The Navigation Act of 1651, passed by Cromwell's 
Rump Parliament in the aftermath of Dutch independence, insisted, among other 
things, that Dutch ships salute the English flag. It was a sign of England's 
growing arrogance. 

Scotland was the scene of bitter religious and political conflicts which 
eventually provoked the 'British Civil Wars' of the mid-seventeenth century. 
Knox's Presbyterian Kirk had been founded on the Genevan model, and was 
designed by its Calvinist founders as a theocracy. But a resentful court party 
repeatedly trimmed its aspirations. In 1572, the year of Knox's death, a regent 
forced the Kirk to accept bishops, thereby causing ceaseless strife between 
Church and State. In 1610, to safeguard the apostolic succession, James VI had 
three Scottish bishops consecrated by their English counterparts. In 1618 he 
imposed his five Articles, which insisted on a number of practices such as 
kneeling at communion. At each step he suspended the General Assembly of the 
Kirk until it submitted, thereby arousing intense popular anger. In 1637 Charles I 
imposed a modified version of the Anglican liturgy and prayerbook. He did so 
by personal order, and without reference to a General Assembly, and sparked a 
rebellion. When the liturgy was first introduced at St Giles's Cathedral in 
Edinburgh on 23 July, it caused a riot. In due course it led to the formation of 
'the Tables', a revolutionary committee of all estates, and in February 1638 to 
the signing of 'the Covenant'. The covenanters recruited an armed league which 
was sworn, Polish-style, to defend its statutes to the death. They sought to 
protect the Presbyterian Kirk from the King and bishops and Scotland from the 
English. They were soon claiming the allegiance of all true Scotsmen, and set up 
a parliament without royal warrant. In August 1640 the first of several armies of 
covenanters crossed the Tweed, and invaded England. 



BLARNEY 


in 1602 Cormack McCarthy, Lord of Blarney in County Cork, repeatedly 
delayed the surrender of his castle to the English through an endless series of 
parleys, promises, queries, and time-wasting speeches. Despite the support 
of a Spanish landing force, the Irish lords had already been heavily defeated 
the previous year at nearby Kinsale; and it was only a matter of time before 
Mountjoy's English army would reduce the whole of Ireland to obedience. 1 
But McCarthy's act of defiance gave people a good laugh; and 'Blarney' 
passed into common parlance as a synonym for 'the miraculous power of 
speech' or 'the gift of the gab'. 2 

Indeed, since the defeated Irish became famous for their musical and 
literary skills, Blarney Castle became a symbol of Irishness and of Irish 
pride. Popularized by the song, 'The Groves of Blarney' (c.1798), it became 
a place of pilgrimage. The castle's foundation-stone, which bears the 
inscription 'Cormac McCarthy fortis me fieri fecit ad 1446', was taken to 
possess magical powers; and the perilous ritual of 'kissing the Blarney 
Stone' under the overhanging battlements is said to reward the pilgrim with 
the gift of persuasiveness. The interesting thing, historically, is that the 
language in which the Irish became so proficient and persuasive was not 
their own. 


In this way Scotland's religious wars became embroiled with the equally 
long-running constitutional struggle between King and Parliament in England. 
Under the Tudors, the partnership between the monarch and the elected 
representatives of the shires and boroughs did not conceal the fact that England's 
Parliament was an instrument of royal policy. 'We at no time stand so highly in 
our estate royal as in the time of Parliament,' declared Henry VIII to a 
parliamentary delegation, 'wherein we as head and you as members are 
conjoined and knit together into one body politick.' There were no doubts who 
was head: parliamentarians had no immunity, and had reason to fear the royal 
wrath. 

The winning of the political initiative by the House of Commons under 
James I, however, put an end to Parliament's subservience. In the long term, 
parliamentary control of taxation was to prove decisive. In 1629-40, when 




Charles I decided to rule without Parliament, no one had the means to oppose 
him. But in April 1640, when the costs of the Scottish war forced the King to 
recall the English Parliament and to beg for money, the storm broke. Court talk 
about the divine right of kings was opposed by parliamentary lawyers quoting 
Magna Carta. According to the popular dictum of the late Chief Justice, Sir 
Edward Coke, The law of the realm cannot be changed but by parliament 5 . A 
Grand Remonstrance (1641) faced the King with a vast catalogue of 
recriminations. His chief minister, the Earl of Strafford, was impeached by 
Parliament and, with the King's reluctant consent, sacrificed. 

Ireland now entered the equation. Strafford had treated the Presbyterians of 
Ulster with the same harshness that his predecessors had used towards the Irish 
Catholics. He had started to raise an Irish army for use against the King's 
rebellious subjects in England and Scotland; but on quitting Ireland in June 1641 
without paying the troops, he left a country in open rebellion. A Scots army 
arrived in Ireland to support their Protestant co-religionists; and multi-sided 
warfare proceeded unchecked. Baulked on all sides, Charles I then attempted in 
good Tudor style to arrest the contumacious members of the English Commons. 
He failed: T see the birds have flown,' he stuttered. There was nothing left for 
him but to flee London and to call his subjects to arms. Defied by the Parliament 
which he had not wished to summon, he abandoned the tradition of kings 
accepting the advice of their councils, and raised his standard at Nottingham. It 
was the summer of 1642. The conflict was to cost him his life. No satisfactory 
constitutional equilibrium was reached until 1689. 

The 'English Civil War', therefore, is a misnomer which inadequately 
describes the nature of a very complex conflict. It did not start in England, and 
was not confined to England. It embraced three separate civil wars in Scotland, 
Ireland, and England, and involved interrelated developments within all parts of 
the Stuart realm. The crisis in England in August 1642 cannot be viewed in 
isolation. The King's edgy conduct towards the Parliament at Westminster was 
undoubtedly conditioned by his unhappy experiences in Edinburgh. The 
militancy of English parliamentarians was heightened by their knowledge of the 
King's despotic policies in Scotland and Ireland, by his proven record of 
religious impositions, and by the fighting already in progress. Here, above all, 
was a conflict of political and religious principle. Attempts to explain it in terms 
of social groups or economic interests, though helpful on some points, have not 
replaced the older analyses based on a mix of constitutional and religious 
convictions. Catholics and High Church Anglicans felt the greatest loyalty for 



the King, whose monarchical prerogatives were under attack. English puritans 
and Calvinist Scots provided the core support of Parliament, which they saw as a 
bulwark against absolutism. The gentry was split down the middle. 

The English have been taught that their Civil War did not share the religious 
bigotry and mindless killings of contemporary wars on the Continent. One of the 
favourite quotations is taken from a letter of the parliamentary major-general, Sir 
William Waller, which he addressed to the commander of the royalists' western 
army, Sir Ralph Hopton, on the eve of the battle at Roundway Down in 1643: 


My affections to you are so unchangeable that hostility itself cannot violate my friendship to your person, 
but I must be true to the cause I serve. The great God, who is a searcher of my heart, knows... with what 
perfect hatred I look upon this war without an enemy. We are both upon the stage and we must act the parts 
assigned to us in this tragedy. Let us do it in a way of honour and without personal animosities.- 

If such forbearance had prevailed, the wars could never have been sustained. 

For there were several key issues on which neither party was prepared to 
show a margin of tolerance. The 'low-taxation philosophy' of the 
parliamentarians did not provide the means for the King to govern effectively. 
Also, the dominant English establishment was only interested in England, and 
careless of the separate interests of Ireland and Scotland. Above all, in religious 
matters, both sides were determined to persecute their opponents in the hope of 
imposing a single religion. The War 'was not fought for religious liberty, but 
between rival groups of persecutors'.- The royalists upheld the Act of 
Uniformity. The Parliament, in its hour of military triumph, attempted to impose 
the Presbyterian Covenant. Both found that absolute uniformity could not be 
enforced. 

Nor was the war free of horrors. Well-documented atrocities such as the 
general massacre at Bolton (June 1644) perpetrated by the troops of Prince 
Rupert of the Rhine, or the fearful Sack of Drogheda (1649), where Cromwell 
slaughtered the entire population of an Irish town, were accompanied by the 
less-publicized practices of killing prisoners and razing villages. 

Four years of fighting saw a large number of engagements involving both 
local and central forces. The royalists, with their headquarters in Christ Church, 
Oxford, initially held the upper hand in most of the English counties. But the 
parliamentary forces, aided by the Scots' League of Covenanters, held an 
impregnable base in London, and hence the organs of central government. In due 


course they were able to raise a professional New Model Army, whose creator, 
the formidable Oliver Cromwell (1599-1658), gradually assumed a commanding 
role in political as well as military affairs. Parliament often controlled the towns 
and the King the countryside. Neither combatant enjoyed any general advantage, 
until Parliament slowly reaped the benefits of superior organization, of an 
invincible general, and of the Scots alliance. After the initial clash at Edge Hill 
(24 September 1642) north of Oxford, the decisive battles were contested at 
Marston Moor in Yorkshire (2 July 1644) and at Naseby (14 June 1645). Once 
the King had surrendered to the Scots at Newark in 1646, all open resistance 
from the royalists ceased. 

As the fighting slowed, the political situation accelerated with revolutionary 
speed. The parliamentary camp was rapidly radicalized, both in its republicanism 
and in its association with extreme evangelical sectarians, among them the 
Levellers and the Diggers. Unable to pin the King to a firm agreement, 
Cromwell decided on his execution-which was carried out in front of Whitehall 
Palace on 31 January 1649, thereby initiating the Commonwealth. Unable to 
control the Long Parliament, Cromwell purged it. Unable to win over the Irish 
and the Scots by persuasion, he invaded first Ireland then Scotland. His victory 
over the Scots at Worcester (1651) left him totally triumphant in the field. Yet he 
could never engineer a political settlement to match his military triumphs. 
Unable to carry even the Barebones Parliament of picked supporters, he 
dissolved it. 'Necessity', he told them, 'hath no law.' Cromwell was left ruling as 
Lord Protector through the colonels of eleven military districts. The 
parliamentary cause, having abandoned parliamentary government, was 
politically bankrupt. 

'The Great Oliver' was a man of unparalleled strength of purpose. 'Mr Lely,' 
he told the portraitist, 'I desire you ... to paint the picture truly like me, and to 
remark all these roughnesses, pimples, and warts; otherwise I will never pay you 
a farthing.' But he devised no lasting solutions, and was apt to attribute 
everything, even the massacre of Drogheda, to the judgement of God. On his 
death the royalist cause revived. There was no alternative to a return of the status 
quo ante bellum. Both King and Parliament had to be restored. Charles II 
returned from exile on 29 May 1660, on the terms of an Act of Indemnity and 
Oblivion. Both King and Parliament had to relearn the rules of watchful 
cohabitation. 

In some ways the British Civil Wars were symptomatic of strains which 



surrounded the growth of a modern state in numerous European countries. But 
they did not inspire any Continental emulators, and must be judged a tragedy of 
essentially regional significance. 

Across the North Sea, the Scandinavian countries were moving in the opposite 
direction-away from unification. Sweden, in particular, had long fretted against 
Danish dominance. It had possessed its own Riksdag or 'parliament' of four 
estates since the 1460s, and its own university at Uppsala since 1479. At 
Christmas in 1520 a revolt broke out in Darlecarlia against the coronation of yet 
another Danish king. A bloodbath in the city square of Stockholm, where a 
hundred supporters of the revolt were executed for treason, only fanned the 
flames. Led by a young nobleman, Gustav Eriksson Vasa, the rebels expelled the 
Danish army. In 1523 the Union of Kalmar fell apart. Sweden, under Gustavus 
Vasa (r. 1523-60), went its own way. Denmark and Norway, under Frederick I (r. 
1523-33) and his successors, were early recruits to Lutheranism. The resultant 
rivalry, not least over the disputed province of Halland, remained intense for 
more than a century. 

Sweden 's fortunes were tied henceforth to the Vasas, to the search for supremacy 
in the Baltic, and, with some delay, to the Protestant cause. In 1527, at the Diet 
of Vasteras, Gustavus created an Erastian Church anticipating that of Henry VIII 
in England. He abolished the Catholic rite; but by transferring the landed wealth 
of the Church to his supporters, he created the social base for a powerful 
monarchy. His second son, John III (r. 1568-92), married the heiress of the 
Polish Jagiellons, and his grandson, Sigismund Vasa (r. 1592-1604), was elected 
King of Poland. Sigismund was seen as the last hope of Sweden's fading 
Catholic party, and the civil war which flowed from his accession persuaded the 
majority of the nobles to identify national independence with Protestantism. In 
1593 the Synod of Uppsala adopted the Confession of Augsburg for the state 
religion. Sigismund was deposed in favour of his uncle, Charles IX of 
Sodermanland (r. 1604-11), parent of the Protestant line. Henceforth, in the 
constant wars with Poland, Sweden added dynastic and religious motives to the 
conflict of strategic interests in the Baltic. 

The young Gustavus Adolphus (r. 1611-32) assumed that attack was the best 
form of defence. Possessed of immense talent, a secure political base, a navy, 
and a native army that was to outclass even the Spaniards, he perfected the art of 



self-financing military expeditions. In 1613 he recovered Kalmar from Denmark; 
in 1614-17 he intervened in Muscovy's Time of Troubles, coming away with 
Ingria and Karelia; in 1617-29 he attacked Poland-Lithuania, taking Riga (1621) 
and besieging Danzig (1626-9). He once escaped capture by Polish hussars by a 
whisker; but he made so much money milking the Vistula tolls that he could play 
for still greater stakes. In 1630, with French backing, he made his dramatic entry 
into Germany. His death in battle at Liitzen (see below) cut short a career still 
full of promise. 

Queen Christina (r. 1632-54), who grew up under the regency of Chancellor 
Oxenstierna, saw Sweden rise to its peak with the conquest of Halland (1645) 
and the Treaty of Westphalia. But she secretly converted to Catholicism, 
abdicated, and retired to Rome. Her cousin Charles X (r. 1654-60), worried by 
the ambitions of Moscow and by the cost of an unemployed army, resorted to the 
old policy of intervention in Poland-Lithuania. His untimely death gave occasion 
for the comprehensive settlement at the Treaty of Oliva (1660) (see below). 

Sweden never gained complete control of the Baltic, the much-heralded 
dominium mans Baldcae. But for half a century she played a disproportionate 
part in European affairs-the terror of the north, the military wonder of the age, 
the most active of the Protestant powers. 

Poland-Lithuania was another country which experienced its 'Golden Age' 
during the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. The realm of the last 
Jagiellons was absolutely the largest state in Europe; and it escaped both the 
religious wars and the Ottoman invasions which beset many of its 
contemporaries. Under Zygmunt I (r. 1506-48) and Zygmunt-August (r. 1548- 
72), husband and son of yet another Sforza queen, it enjoyed strong links with 
Italy, especially with Venice; and Cracow hosted one of the most vibrant of 
Renaissance courts. 

The Rzeczpospolita -'Republic' or 'Commonwealth'-which came into 
being at the Union of Lublin (1569) resulted partly from the lack of a royal heir 
and partly from the threat of Muscovite expansion. It was an early form of 
Ausgleich between Polish and Lithuanian interests. The Korona or Kingdom of 
Poland accepted the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as an equal partner, though it 
took over the vast palatinates of Ukraine in compensation. The Grand Duchy 
retained its own laws, its own administration, and its own army. The dual state 
was to be governed by a common elective monarchy and by a common Sejm or 



Diet. The ruling szlachta who designed this system of noble democracy reserved 
a dominant role. Through their regional assemblies or sejmiki (dietines), which 
controlled the central Diet, they ran taxation and military affairs. Through the 
Pacta Conventa or 'agreed terms' which they attached to the Coronation Oath, 
they could hire their kings like managers on contract. Through their legal right of 
resistance embodied in armed leagues or confederations, they could defend their 
position against all royal machinations. Through the principle of unanimity, 
which governed all their deliberations, they ensured that no king or faction could 
override the common interest. This was not the system of general anarchy which 
prevailed in the eighteenth century. Whatever its faults, it was a bold experiment 
in democracy that, in the era of absolutism and religious strife, offered a 
refreshing alternative. The reputation of the Rzeczpospolita among fellow- 
democrats should not depend on the jaundiced propaganda of its later assassins. 

In the eighty years which separated the Union of Lublin from the general 
crisis of 1648, the Rzeczpospolita fared better than its neighbours. Baltic trade 
brought unaccustomed wealth to many noblemen. The cities, especially Danzig, 
prospered mightily under their royal charters. The Counter-Reformation, though 
vigorously pursued, did not cause open strife. The nobles, though they brought 
government to a halt during the great rokosz or 'legal rebellion' of 1606-9, did 
not usually push the paralysing practices of a later age to extremes. They usually 
elected kings who were resistant to the bishops and to the ultramontane, pro- 
Habsburg faction. Foreign wars were fought either on the periphery or on foreign 
territory. 

The monarchy, though run by kings of varying talent, retained its general 
authority. Admittedly, the first elected king, Henry Valois (r. 1574-5) was an 
unmitigated disaster; but he fled after four months, to inflict his person on his 
native France, and was not mourned. The next, the vigorous Transylvanian 
Stefan Batory (r. 1576-86), reasserted respect and drove the complicated 
machinery of the state into effective action. His successful war against Ivan the 
Terrible in 1578-82 brought possession of Livonia. The third king, the Swede 
Sigismund Vasa (r. 1587-1632), suffered many vicissitudes, but outlived both 
the rokosz and Poland's unsettling intervention in Muscovy in 1610-19. His two 
sons, Wladyslaw IV (r. 1632-48), the sometime Tsar, and John Casimir (r. 1648- 
68), the sometime Cardinal, experienced respectively calm and chaos. 

The chain reaction of calamities which marked John Casimir's reign erupted 
from an almost cloudless sky. In 1648-54 the rebellion of the Dnieper Cossacks 



under Bogdan Chmielnicki (Khmelnytsky), which brought a murderous army of 
Cossacks and Tartars right up to the Vistula, left a swathe of butchered Catholics 
and Jews across Ukraine. It linked peasant fury to the very real political, social, 
and religious grievances of the eastern provinces. It was virtually suppressed by 
the time a despairing Chmielnicki turned to the Tsar for aid. The Muscovite 
invasion of 1654-67, which brought death and destruction both to Lithuania and 
to Ukraine, aroused the strategic anxieties of the Swedes. The double Swedish 
invasion of 1655-60, which was known in Poland as Potop or 'the Deluge', 
overran both the Kingdom and the Grand Duchy and drove the King into exile 
and the magnates into treason. Only the monastery of Jasna Gora at 
Czestochowa, whose Black Madonna deflected Swedish cannon-balls with 
miraculous ease, was able to resist. The accompanying invasions of the 
Transylvanians and the Brandenburgers pushed the country close to total 
collapse. But Poland recovered with marvellous resilience. The Muscovites were 
halted; the Swedes were rounded up; the Prussians were bought off. In 1658 
Hetman Czamecki could even afford to go campaigning against Sweden in 
Jutland. The Treaty of Oliva (1660), which settled the demands of the Republic's 
western neighbours, ended the Vasa feud, confirmed the independence of Ducal 
Prussia, and promised better times. 

Thereafter, the Republic seemed to have been given space to tackle its 
outstanding problems. In the annual campaigns of the 1660s, the Polish cavalry 
steadily pushed the Muscovites back towards Russia. Then, with general 
recovery already in view, the King's programme of constitutional reform aroused 
a disproportionate and violent reaction from the noble democrats. In 1665-7 the 
fratricidal strife of Hetman Lubomirski's rebellion put an end to progress on all 
fronts. It produced political stalemate between the King and his opponents. At 
the same time it pushed the Republic into the fateful Truce of Andrusovo (1667), 
which handed Kiev and left-bank Ukraine to the Russians, in theory for twenty 
years, in practice forever. The King abdicated and retired to France, where he 
was buried in the church of St Germain-des-Pres. The debased coinage of his 
reign bore his initials, ICR: Iohannes Casimirus Rex. These were taken to stand 
for Initium Calamitatum Reipublicae, the Beginning of the Republic's 
Catastrophes. 

The beginnings of Poland's distress coincided with the stirrings of power in 
two of Poland's neighbours-Prussia and Muscovy. 



Prussia, which in the early sixteenth century still housed the remains of the 
Teutonic State, had been wasting away for decades, and stood in desperate need 
of radical renovation. It had lost its mission for converting the pagans through 
the conversion of Lithuania, its military supremacy through the defeat at 
Grunwald (1410), and its commercial prominence through Poland's acquisition 
of Elbing, Thorn, and Danzig (1466). Its very existence was threatened by the 
onset of the German Reformation, and it was hurriedly transformed by its last 
Grand Master, Albrecht von Hohenzollern, into a secular fief of the Kingdom of 
Poland. A convert to Lutheranism, he dismissed the Teutonic Order, and in 1525 
paid homage for his new duchy in the city square of Cracow. From the capital of 
Konigsberg, he laid the strategy which would eventually link his possessions 
with those of his relatives in Brandenburg. By purchasing the legal reversion of 
his duchy, he ensured that the failure of his own heirs would automatically give 
possession to the Hohenzollerns of Berlin. The policy came to fruition in 1618: 
after that, one and the same Hohenzollern ruler enjoyed the twin titles of Elector 
of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia, and the state of Brandenburg-Prussia was 
born (see Appendix III, p. 1276). 

Frederick-William (r. 1640-88), the Great Elector, who spoke Polish and 
harboured pretensions of being 'the first prince of Poland', paid homage for his 
duchy in 1641. Fifteen years later his troops occupied Warsaw, capital of his 
liege, at the height of the Swedish Deluge. The Prussian army had made its 
debut. All that was needed thereafter was a double diplomatic double-cross 
which wrested recognition of Prussia's sovereign status first from the Swedes 
and then from the Poles. It gained formal recognition at Oliva. The Prussian 
spirit was on the march. 

Muscovy, whose strategy of grandeur was launched by Ivan III, held to its course 
with marvellous tenacity. Ivan IV (r. 1533-84), known as Grozny or 'the 
Terrible', finalized the patrimonial state which his predecessors had prepared. 
'All the people consider themselves to be kholops,' wrote one of the earliest 
Western travellers, 'that is, slaves of their Prince.'- By establishing the 
oprichnina -the forerunner of all subsequent Russian security agencies-he was 
able to set aside whole provinces for his private will and domain, and to unleash 
a reign of unrestrained terror. By razing Novgorod, and slaughtering almost its 
entire population in a blood-bath that proceeded for weeks, he affirmed 
Moscow's supremacy in Russia. By destroying the power of ancient boyar clans 


and their zemskii Sobor or Council he created a thoroughly subservient, 
hierarchical society. By appointing the first Patriarch of Moscow he completed 
the separate and dependent nature of the Russian Orthodox Church, henceforth 
severed from all outside influences. By annexing the khanate of Kazan, where 
the great Orthodox cathedral of the Annunciation (1562) was raised as a 
monument to a Christian victory in a Muslim land, he gave notice of 
unrestrained imperial ambitions. Through the razryiad or 'service list' and the 
pomestnyi prikaz, the 'bureau of placements', he kept track of all state servants 
and their appointments: the forerunner of the nomenklatura. After such 
comprehensive socio-political transplants and amputations, it is not surprising 
that the patient fell sick. 

The Smutnoe Vremya or 'Time of Troubles' filled the years between the death 
of Ivan's son Feodor in 1598, and the accession of the Romanovs fifteen years 
later. With central authority in shreds, the warring boyar factions raised five ill- 
starred Tsars in succession; there were peasant revolts and Cossack raids; and the 
country was invaded by Swedes, Poles, and Tartars. Feodor's chief minister, 
Boris Godunov (r. 1598-1605), a Tartar boyar, was brought down amidst 
accusations of killing the rightful heir. The False Dmitri I (r. 1605-6), an 
impostor, claimed to be Ivan's murdered son. Having gained the support of a 
Polish magnate, Jerzy Mniszek, and of Mniszek's Jesuit friends, he married 
Mniszek's daughter Marina, and marched on Moscow. His brief, reforming reign 
came to an explosive end when he was fired from a cannon in Red Square by the 
followers of the next contestant, Basil Shuiskiy (r. 1605-11). Shuiskiy was in 
turn overthrown by another impostor, the False Dmitri II, the 'Thief of Tushino', 
who somehow managed to persuade Marina that he was her resurrected husband. 
Shuiskiy died in Polish captivity. He was succeeded by the Polish Crown Prince, 
Wladyslaw Vasa, whose candidature was being pressed by yet another of the 
boyar factions. 

Though many Polish nobles, like Mniszek, had long been privately involved 
in the Troubles, the official policy of the Rzeczpospolita was to stand aloof. The 
King had declined to back Mniszek's plan-despite Russian rumours to the 
contrary; and the Diet had warned the King against committing any money or 
forces beyond the limited objective of recapturing Smolensk. Hence, when the 
Polish army advanced on Smolensk in 1610, alongside the Swedes already in 
Novgorod, it had no orders to go further. However, as their commander later 
explained to an angry Sejm, the Poles pressed on despite instructions. With the 
Russian army defeated at Klushino and the road to Moscow undefended, they 



occupied the Kremlin unopposed. A garrison remained for a year until forced to 
surrender. It set Moscow ablaze before being murdered by a patriotic Russian 
populace rallying to Minin the butcher, Pozharskiy the prince, and Michael 
Romanov (r. 1613-45), the new Tsar. The Russians had found their dynasty, and 
their national identity. It was a ready-made subject for opera, [susanin] 

Moscow's recovery was slow but methodical. The Poles were seen off by 
1619; Prince Wltdyslaw resigned his claim; Smolensk was recovered (1654). 
Under Alexei Mikhailovitch (r. 1645-76), fundamental reforms caused internal 
turmoil that was only partly offset by territorial acquisitions. A reform of the law, 
which led to the Ulozhenie or Legal Code of 1649 containing over 1,000 articles, 
perpetuated and systematized serfdom, creating conditions that underlay the vast 
peasant rising of Sten'ka Razin. The Church reforms of Patriarch Nikon (1605- 
81), who aimed both to modernize the rite and to moderate state control, 
provoked both the defection of the Old Believers and the ire of the Tsar. Military 
reforms on Western lines preceded the none too successful campaigns against 
Poland. In this light, the great territorial gains of the Truce of Andrusovo (1667) 
came as an unexpected bonus (see Appendix III, p. 1277). 

Yet the acquisition of Ukraine from Poland cannot be overestimated. It gave 
Muscovy the economic resources and the geopolitical stance to become a great 
power. What is more, it came in the same generation that pushed the exploration 
and conquest of Siberia to the Pacific. The formula Muscovy + Ukraine = Russia 
does not feature in the Russians' own version of their history; but it is 
fundamental. In which case the true founder of the Russian Empire was Alexei 
Mikhailovitch, not his more celebrated son Peter, [terem] 

The lengthy contest between Russia, Poland, and Sweden was deciding the 
fate of Eastern Europe. In retrospect, one can see that the Truce of Andrusovo of 
1667 tipped the balance of power. Poland-Lithuania was being imperceptibly 
replaced by Russia as the dominant state of the region. Poland and Russia, 
however, had one thing in common. Neither allowed itself to be dragged into the 
Thirty Years War. 

The Ottoman Empire, the southern neighbour of Poland and Russia, reached its 
apogee at the same time as the Habsburgs. From the Muslim perspective, the key 
development lay in the Ottomans' decision to lead the main Sunni branch of 
Islam against the ShTites. When Sultan Selim I (r. 1512-20) moved against 
Persia, he ended the sixty-year pause which followed the Fall of Constantinople. 



Thereafter, the conquest of the former caliphates of Damascus, Cairo, and 
Baghdad (1534) took place in succession. Suleiman I 'the Magnificent' (r. 1520- 
66), who added the Prophet's tomb in Mecca to the realm, had good reason to 
style himself Padishah-i-Islam, 'Emperor of Islam'. Many monuments, 
including the Siileymaniye Mosque in Istanbul, attest to the reality of that 
magnificence. 


TEREM 

Sophia Alexeyevna, the sixth child of Tsar Alexei Mikhailovitch, was born 
in the Moscow Kremlin on 17 September 1657. As a junior princess in a 
country that had never recognized female succession, her prospects for 
attaining political power were almost nil. 

In Muscovy, high-born ladies were kept in strict seclusion. 1 They lived in 
separate female quarters, the Terem, in Muslim fashion, and only sallied 
forth either veiled or in closed carriages. A special Terem Palace had been 
added to the Kremlin in the 1630s to accommodate the ladies. What is more, 
the sisters and daughters of the Tsars were usually condemned to celibacy. 
As an official explained, they could not be married to noblemen, since it was 
a disgrace 'to give a lady to a slave'. And they could not be easily married to 
foreign princes for fear of contaminating the court with heresy or faction. 
'The female sex is not venerated among the Muscovites', reported an 
Austrian envoy, 'as amongst the majority of the nations of Europe. In this 
country, they are the slaves of men, who esteem them little.' 2 

None the less, in association with the leading minister, Prince Golitsyn, 
Sophia came to exercise influence during the reign of her brother Feodor 
(1676-82). Then, having mediated in a military rebellion, she broke the 
bounds of the Terem completely, becoming Regent during the minority of 
the co-Tsars Ivan and Peter, and the first woman ruler of Russia. She 
personally presided over foreign policy, in particular over the 'Eternal Peace' 
with Poland, which put Moscow at the head of East European affairs (see p. 
657). 

Sophia's reputation was blackened by supporters of Peter the Great, who 




terminated her regency in 1689. Dismissed as an ambitious schemer, she has 
often been described in the words of a dubious quotation as being 'of 
monstrous size, with a head as big as a bushel, with hair on her face and 
growths on her legs'. 3 She lived her last fourteen years as Sister Susanna in 
the Novodevichy Convent-a foundation which she had earlier endowed in 
the style of the 'Moscow Baroque'. 

Female biography is often inspired by a wish to compensate for the 
overblown record of male achievers. It is the oldest form of herstoriography, 
and has been successfully applied to a large number of heroines from 
Sappho and Boudicca to Eleanor of Aquitaine and Elizabeth of England. But 
in one sense it can be misleading. The lives of exceptional women cannot 
fail to emphasize the gulf which separated them from the average woman's 
lot. Sophia Alexeyevna was a ruler who proved the exception. 


From the Christian viewpoint, danger signals began to flash when the Turks 
used their new-found strength to move westwards. They advanced both up the 
Danube valley into Hungary, and against the corsair states of the North African 
coast. The Danubian campaigns began in 1512 with the takeover of Moldavia. 
Then, when Belgrade was captured (1521), the wide Hungarian plain lay open to 
the Ottoman advance. After 1526, when the last independent King of Bohemia 
and Hungary, Louis II Jagiellon, was killed at the Battle of Mohacs, Austria 
itself came under threat. The Turks laid their first unsuccessful Siege of Vienna 
in 1529, and three years later were still raiding deep into the alpine valleys. The 
truce of 1533 was only obtained at the price of the partition of Hungary. Western 
Hungary was left to its new Habsburg rulers; central Hungary, including 
Budapest, became an Ottoman province; Transylvania became a separate 
principality subject to Ottoman tutelage. Skirmishing raged all along the new 
borders until the Peace of Adrianople (1568), when the Habsburgs undertook to 
pay annual tribute. In 1620-1 the Turks moved up the Dniester beyond 
Moldavia, only to feel the weight of the Polish hussars at Chocim. [uskok] 

In the Mediterranean, renewed Ottoman expansion was signalled by the 
attack on Rhodes and the capitulation of the Knights Hospitallers (1522). Algiers 
was captured in 1529, Tripoli in 1551, Cyprus in 1571, Tunis at the second 
attempt in 1574. Malta survived a grand siege (1565). In the view of the Catholic 




world, the centrepiece was provided by the naval battle of Lepanto (1571), 
where Don John of Austria, natural brother of Philip II, succeeded in uniting the 
combined naval forces of Venice, Genoa, and Spain, and destroying the Ottoman 
fleet. Here was the last crusade, the last battle of massed galleys, the last 
significant Ottoman move for many decades, [greco] 

The Ottoman surge had several consequences. First, it revived the old 
crusading spirit, especially in the Catholic countries. The question posed by 
Erasmus- 'Is not the Turk also a man and a brother?'-reflected an eccentric 
response to contemporary passions. Secondly, it helped preserve the division of 
Christendom by diverting major Catholic forces at the height of the Protestant 
Reformation. The Sultan was Luther's best ally. Thirdly, on the diplomatic front, 
it made the Western powers think more closely about Eastern Europe, and to 
open the first tentative contacts with the East. It underlay France's openings to 
the Porte and to Poland-Lithuania, and the Empire's missions to Moscow. Lastly, 
it started a craze for Turkish styles and artefacts-Europe's first experience of 
'Orientalism'. 


USKOK 

In 1615-17 the Republic of Venice fought an 'Uskok War' in the Adriatic 
against the Habsburgs. The object, as Venice saw it, was to suppress 
Habsburg-sponsored piracy. As the Habsburgs saw it, the uskoki or 'Corsairs 
of Senj', were a necessary part of the Empire's defences, and the Venetians 
were undermining their security. 1 

Senj, now in Croatia, was an Adriatic port situated near the point where 
Venetian, Habsburg, and Ottoman territory met. Its castle was the coastal 
anchor of the Habsburgs' Militargrenze or vojna krajina, the 'Military 
Frontier', which had been established in the 1520s and consolidated along its 
length with fortified settlements. Its harbour provided a base for the pi rate- 
patriots, who lived partly from fishing, but mainly from plundering Venetian 
ships on the sea and Ottoman towns in the interior. 

These Uskoks -whose name derives from the Croatian word uskociti, 'to 
jump in' or 'to board'-lived by a code of honour and vengeance. They were 




the maritime counterparts of the martial frontiersmen or grenzer, many of 
them refugee Serbs and fugitive serfs, who guarded the length of the inland 
border and who one day would rise against Croatian rule. Like their brothers 
on the Ottoman frontier in Poland and Hungary, or the Cossacks of Ukraine, 
they saw themselves as champions of the faith, defenders of the antemurale 
christianitatis, heroes of the holy war. They were celebrated as such in the 
epic legends of South Slav literature. Their activities were encouraged and 
rewarded by the Habsburgs until the middle of the 18th century. The Krajina 
was not officially abolished until 1881. 

Piracy, like banditry, is a relative concept. Early modern Europe was full of 
klephts, hajduks, 'corsairs' or 'sea-raiders', whose operations might be 
approved by one authority whilst being judged illegal by others. 

The seadogs of England and France were a case in point. When Francis 
Drake (1545-95) sailed out of Plymouth to plunder the Spanish Main or to 
'singe the King of Spain's beard' at Cadiz, he did so under licence from the 
English Queen, and was knighted for his services. But when others behaved 
likewise, they were denounced in England as savages. For a time in the early 
17th century, for example, Moslem corsairs from the Barbary Coast set up 
base on Lundy Island, raiding the ports of Devon and Cornwall and selling 
their captives into slavery. When Jean Bart of Dunkirk (1650-1702) 
terrorized shipping in the Channel and the Bay of Biscay under licence from 
Louis XIV, he was received at Versailles and ennobled. In the eyes of their 
compatriots, Drake or Bart were 'admirals'. In Spanish eyes, they were 
international criminals. One man's 'rover' was the next man's 'robber'. 


GRECO 

Two prominent Cretan artists were known to their contemporaries as El, or 
//, Greco -'the Greek'. One was the painter Dominikos Theotokopoulos, 
who settled in Toledo. The other was the musician and composer Frangiskos 
Leondaritis (c.1518-72), sometime Catholic organist at Kastro, cantor at St 
Mark's Venice, and music master to the Duke of Bavaria. Both were 




products of the Cretan Renaissance. 

Crete, ruled by Venice from 1221 to 1669, was the crossroads of Greek 
and Latin culture. Its capital had been founded and fortified as 'El Khandak' 
during the previous Arab occupation of 827-961; but as Candia or Chandax 
it became the seat of a Venetian Duke. Candia's town square was flanked by 
a ducal palace, by a cathedral of St Mark with campanile, and by a loggia 
that was the favourite meeting-place of the island's Veneto-Cretan lords. 
From 1648 to the final capitulation of 16 September 1669, it was the nerve- 
centre of Duke Morosini's 21-year resistance to the Ottoman siege. 

After the fall of Constantinople, Crete had welcomed numerous 
Byzantine scholars on their way to Italy. It thereby made a contribution to 
the Greek Revival which formed such an important stimulus to the 
Renaissance in the West. Its main contribution to the Greek-speaking world, 
however, lay in influences moving in the opposite direction. A substantial 
Cretan colony in Venice, centred on the Church of San Giorgio, had long 
played a prominent part in the history of Greek printing and publishing. A 
Venetian from Crete, Zacharias Kalliergis, a rival to the Aldine Press of 
Marucci, produced the first book in demotic Greek in 1509. Yet in the last 
century of Venetian rule Crete itself witnessed a sunburst of creativity that 
was to leave its mark far beyond the island's shores. The focus, in addition to 
painting, music, and architecture, was on vernacular Greek literature. A 
school of dramatists using the Cretan dialect composed a corpus of works in 
rhyming couplets that covered a wide range of religious, comic, tragic, and 
pastoral subjects. The Erofili of Georgios Chortatzis (1545-1610) is a 
tragedy set in Egypt. The Erotokritos of Vizentzos Komaros (c. 1553-1614) 
is a romance in the style of Ariosto. The Cretan War of Marinos Bounialis is 
an epic history recounting the events of the Ottoman siege:

(S. Alexiou 1969a: 229) 


(O my glorious Kastro, do they who still live / weep for you and ask after you? / All the people of 
Kastro should put on black / and weep day after day, and sing no more; / men, women and children 
and every maiden / should let it be seen what a fatherland they have lost .) 1 

The theatres and academies of Candia, Kastro, and Rhethymno came to a 
sudden end in 1669. So too did that last fruitful symbiosis of Veneto-Cretan 
culture, which for a brief moment had reached the status of 'an independent, 
innovative force'. But Cretan exiles took their literature with them to the 
mainland, where it soon established itself as popular reading. Though 
despised by the Athenian elite, eighteenth-century book catalogues show that 
it enjoyed wide circulation. Indeed, prior to the work of Dionysius Solomos 
(1798-1857) and the Ionian School, the Cretan dramas formed the sole 
substantial demotic repertoire. It was the Cretan Renaissance which gave the 
Greeks their start as a modern, literate nation. 2 


The Thirty Years War (1618-48) may be seen as an episode in the age-old 
German conflict between Emperor and princes. At another level, it may be seen 
as an extension of the international wars of religion between Catholic and 
Protestant; at yet another, as an important stage in a Continental power-struggle 
involving most of the states and rulers of Europe. It grew from a row in Bohemia 
between the supporters and opponents of Archduke Ferdinand, and it 
mushroomed in four distinct phases. 'Almost all [the combatants]', wrote one of 
its most distinguished historians, 'were actuated by fear rather than by lust of 
conquest or passion of faith. They wanted peace and they fought for thirty years 
to be sure of it. They did not learn then, and have not learned since, that war only 
breeds war.'- 

The Bohemian phase, 1618-23, began on 23 May 1618, when a delegation 
of Czech nobles entered the Hradcany Castle in Prague and threw the Habsburg 
governors, Jaroslav von Martinitz and Wilhelm von Salvata, out of a high 
window and into a dungheap (which broke their fall). They were protesting 
against recent attacks on Protestant churches, against Archduke Ferdinand's 
contested assumption of the Bohemian throne, and against his alleged violations 
of the Royal Charter of Toleration, the Majestatsbrief of 1609. (This 
defenestration of Prague was a deliberate imitation of the incident that had 





sparked off the Hussite War 200 years earlier.) At the time, Ferdinand was 
campaigning for the imperial election, and the religious peace in Germany was 
wavering. The Lutheran princes were watching uneasily as the Evangelical 
Union led by Frederick, Elector Palatine, measured up to the Catholic League 
led by Maximilian, Elector of Bavaria. The Bohemian rebels raided Vienna and 
started a revolt in Austria. In 1619, when Ferdinand succeeded to the Empire, 
they formally deposed him as King of Bohemia, choosing the Calvinist Elector 
Palatine in his place. This meant open war (see Appendix III, p. 1280). 

At the great Battle of Bilahora (Weissenberg, or the White Mountain) near 
Prague on 7 November 1620, the Bohemian army was crushed by the 
imperialists. Then, in a terrible revenge, Bohemia's native nobility was 
suppressed, by execution or confiscation. Czech society was literally 
decapitated. The country was systematically catholicized and germanized. The 
Calvinists were expelled. The 'Winter King' fled. His lands in the Palatinate 
were invaded from the Spanish Netherlands and seized by the Bavarians. The 
Catholics' general, Count Tilly (1559-1632), victor of Prague, stormed 
Heidelberg (1622) and criss-crossed northern Germany in pursuit of the 
Protestant forces headed by Count von Mansfeld (1580-1626). The 
unprovisioned armies began to live off the land like so many hordes of locusts. 

The Danish phase, 1625-9, began when Christian IV of Denmark, Superior 
of the Imperial Circle of Lower Saxony, entered the fray in defence of his hard- 
pressed Protestant confreres. Assisted by English, French, and Dutch subsidies, 
he had to contend with a new imperialist army raised by a Catholic nobleman 
from Bohemia, Albrecht von Waldstein or 'Wallenstein' (1583-1634). After 
defeat at the Bridge of Dessau on the Elbe (1626), the Protestant forces 
attempted to link up with their Transylvanian ally, Bethlen Gabor. Mansfeld 
marched all the way to the Danube, via Silesia. Then it was the turn of the 
imperialists, after dealing with Mansfeld at Neuhausel (near Bratislava), to move 
in strength against the Protestant north. Tilly attacked the Netherlands with the 
help of the Spaniards. Wallenstein overran Brunswick, Lower Saxony, 
Mecklenburg, Schleswig, Holstein, Jutland, and the Baltic coast to the outskirts 
of Stralsund, declaring himself 'Generalissimo of the Baltic and the Ocean 
Seas'. By the Treaty of Liibeck (1629) the Danes were persuaded to retire on the 
return of their lost possessions. By the Edict of Restitution the Emperor ordered 
the Protestants to surrender all the former ecclesiastical lands acquired since the 
Peace of Augsburg. Wallenstein, whose army contained many non-Catholics, 
objected and was dismissed. 



The Swedish phase, 1630-35, began when Gustavus Adolphus sent a 
contingent to hold Stralsund. In 1631, fortified by the Treaty of Barwalde with 
France, he landed with the main Swedish army and proceeded to restore 
Protestant fortunes with vigour. In 1631 he failed to relieve Magdeburg before it 
was mercilessly sacked by the imperialists; but at Breitenfeld he cmshed Tilly 
and moved into the Palatinate. He was joined by John George, Elector of 
Saxony, a Lutheran who previously had backed the Emperor. In 1632 he entered 
Bavaria. Munich and Nuremberg opened their gates. With the Swedes preparing 
to march on Vienna, and the Saxons in Prague, a desperate Emperor was forced 
to recall Wallenstein. At the furious Battle of Liitzen near Leipzig (16 November 
1632), the Swedes prevailed. But Gustavus fell; his naked body was discovered 
under a heap of dead, a bullet hole through his head, a dagger thrust in his side, 
another bullet, ominously, in his back. The Protestant cause faltered until revived 
once more by the League of Heilbronn. In 1634 Wallenstein opened 
negotiations, only to be placed for his pains under the ban of the Empire, and 
assassinated. After the imperial success at Nordlingen, an ailing Emperor made 
peace with the Lutheran princes at Prague. The Edict of Restitution was 
suspended. 

One day in 1631, the Bavarian town of Rothenburg-ob-der-Tauber was 
invested by the imperial army. According to tradition, General Tilly ordered that 
the town be put to the sack unless one of the citizens could drink up an enormous 
flagon of wine. Whereon the Burgermeister, Heinrich Toppler, drained the 
flagon, saved the town, and fell down dead. His feat is commemorated in a play, 
Der Meistertrunk, which is performed to this day every Whit Monday in the 
Kaisersaal of the Rathaus. 

The experience of one village must stand as an example of thousands of 
others. In January 1634 twenty Swedish soldiers rode into Linden in Franconia, 
demanding food and wine. They broke into one of the thirteen cottages, 
belonging to Georg Rosch, raped his wife, and took what they wanted. Shortly 
afterwards, they were ambushed by the villagers, stripped of their clothes, loot 
and horses. The next day, they returned with a constable, who arrested four men 
for assaulting the Swedes. He then made a report to General Horn, naming one 
of the soldiers, a Finn, as Frau Rosch's rapist. What happened next is not clear; 
but shortly after the village was registered as uninhabited. Its inhabitants did not 
return to their prewar number until 1690. - [hexen] 

The French phase, 1635-48, began when France became the protector of the 


League of Heilbronn, whose remaining Calvinist members had been excluded 
from the Peace of Prague. Richelieu's strategy now came into the open. France 
declared war on Spain, took the Swedes into its pay, and invaded Alsace. The 
war developed on three fronts, in the Netherlands, on the Rhine, and in Saxony. 
In 1636 the Spaniards advanced towards Paris, but pulled back when threatened 
from the flank. In 1637 the Emperor Ferdinand died, raising hopes for an 
eventual peace. From 1638, when Richelieu's German allies presented him with 
the great fortress of Breisach on the Rhine, French fortunes were mounting. The 
arrival of the youthful Due d'Enghien, Prince de Conde (1621-86), gave them 
the finest general in Europe. His stunning victory at Rocroi in the Ardennes 
(1643) ended the Spanish military supremacy which had lasted since Pavia in 
1525. From 1644 the diplomats were hard at work, shuttling between the 
Protestant delegates at Osnabriick and the Catholic delegates at Munster. Whilst 
they argued, the French and the Swedes ravaged Bavaria. 

The Treaty of Westphalia, which was arranged simultaneously in its two 
parts, set the ground plan of the international order in central Europe for the next 
century and more. It registered both the ascendancy of France and the 
subordination of the Habsburgs to the German princes. On the religious issue, it 
ended the strife in Germany by granting the same rights to the Calvinists as to 
Catholics and Lutherans. It fixed 1624 as the date for ecclesiastical restitution; 
and it made provision for denominational changes except in the Upper Palatinate 
and in the hereditary lands of the House of Austria, which were reserved for the 
Catholic faith. On the constitutional issue, it greatly strengthened the Princes by 
granting them the right to sign foreign treaties and by making all imperial 
legislation conditional on the Diet's approval. It proposed that both Bavaria and 
the Palatinate be made electorates. On the numerous territorial issues, it 
attempted to give something to all the leading claimants. Switzerland and the 
United Provinces received their independence. The Dutch succeeded in their 
demand that the Scheldt be closed to traffic. France received a lion's share- 
sovereignty over Metz, Toul, and Verdun; Pinerolo; the Sundgau in southern 
Alsace; Breisach; garrison rights in Philippsburg; the Landvogtei or 'Advocacy' 
often further Alsatian cities. Sweden received Bremen and Verden, and western 
Pomerania including Stettin. Bavaria took the Upper Palatinate; Saxony took 
Lusatia; Brandenburg took the greater part of eastern Pomerania up to the Polish 
frontier, the former bishoprics of Halberstadt, Minden, and Kammin, and the 
'candidacy' of Magdeburg. Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Brunswick-Liineburg, and 
Hesse-Kassel were each thrown a morsel. The final signatures were penned on 



24 October 1648. 


HEXEN 

In 1635 Dr Benedikt Carpzov (1595-1666), professor at Leipzig and son 
and brother of Saxony's most celebrated jurists, published his Pracdca 
rerum criminalium on the conduct of witch trials. Whilst admitting that 
torture exacted many false confessions, he advocated its use. 'He would live 
to a ripe old age, and look back on a meritorious life in which he had read 
the Bible fifty-three times, taken the sacrament every week ... and procured 
the death of 20,000 persons.' 1 He was a Protestant, and Europe's leading 
witch-hunter. Nowadays, historians challenge the numbers. 

A few years earlier Johann Julius, burgomaster of Bamberg in Franconia, 
lay in the town dungeon, condemned to death for attending a witches' 
sabbath. He had been denounced by the Chancellor of the principality, who 
had already been burned for showing 'suspicious leniency' in witch trials. 
But he managed to smuggle out a detailed account of the proceedings to his 
daughter. 'My dearest child ... it is all falsehood and invention, so help me 
God ... They never cease to torture until one says something ... If God sends 
no means of bringing the truth to light, our whole kindred will be burnt.' 2 
The Catholic Prince-Bishop of Bamberg, Johan Georg II Fuchs von 
Dornheim, possessed a purpose-built witch-house, complete with torture- 
chamber adorned with biblical texts. In his ten-year reign (1623-33) he is 
said to have burned 600 witches. 

The European witch craze had reached one of its periodic peaks. In 
England, the Pendle Witches of Lancashire were brought to justice in 1612. 
In Poland, the record of a trial at Kalisz detailed the procedures in the self¬ 
same year: 

Naked, shaved above and below, anointed with holy oil, suspended from the ceiling lest by touching 
the ground she summon the Devil to her aid, and bound hand and foot, 'she was willing to say nothing 
except that she sometimes bathed sick people with herbs. Racked, she said she was innocent, God 
knows. Burned with candles, she said nothing, only that she was innocent. Lowered, she said that she 
was innocent to Almighty God in the Trinity. Repositioned, and again burned with candles, she said 
Ach! Ach! Ach! For God's sake, she did go with Dorota and the miller's wife ... Thereafter the 




confessions agreed .' 3 

In the countryside, villagers often took matters into their own hands. If a 
suspected witch drowned when submerged in a pond on the 'ducking-stool', 
she was obviously innocent. If she floated, she was guilty. 

Many learned treatises were written on the black arts of witchcraft. They 
included Jean Bodin's De la demonomanie des sorciers (1580), the 
Daemonolatreia (1595) of Nicholas Remy in Lorraine, the massive 
encyclopaedia of Martin del Rio SJ published at Louvain in 1600, and King 
James's Demonologie (1597) in Scotland. They discussed the mechanics of 
night-flying on broomsticks, the nature and effect of spells and curses, the 
menu of witches' cauldrons, and, above all, the sexual orgies organized at 
witches' sabbaths. The Devil was said to appear either as a bearded black 
man, or as a 'stinking goat', who liked to be kissed under the tail, or as a 
toad. He could be an incubus for the benefit of she-witches, or a succubus 
for the benefit of he-witches. He sometimes summoned his faithful fifth 
column to crowded general assemblies in notorious locations such as the 
Blakulla Meadow in Sweden, the summit of the Blocksberg in the Harz, or 
to the Aquelarre at La Hendaye in Navarre. 

The witch craze poses many problems. Historians have to explain why 
the age of the Renaissance and the Reformation proved so much more 
vicious in this regard than the so-called Dark Ages, why superstition came to 
a head when humanism and the scientific revolution were supposedly 
working in the opposite direction. They usually attribute it to the 
pathological effects of religious conflict. They must also explain why certain 
countries and regions, notably Germany and the Alps, were specially 
susceptible, and why the most ardent witch-hunters, such as King James VI 
and I, were among the most learned and, at the conscious level, the most 
Christian men of their day. And there is an important comparative aspect: the 
collective hysteria and false denunciations of witch-hunting have much in 
common with the phenomena of Jew-baiting and of the Communist purges. 

[DEVIATIO] [HARVEST] [POGROM] 

From the papal bull of 1484 to its decline in the eighteenth century, the 
craze persisted intermittently for 300 years, consuming vast numbers of 
innocents. Signs of critical protest first emerged among the Jesuits of 
Bavaria, where persecutions had been especially fanatical, notably with 
Friedrich Spee's Cautio criminalis (1631). Europe's last witch-burnings took 



place in Scotland in 1722, in Switzerland and Spain in 1782, and in 
Prussian-occupied Poznan in 1793. By that time, they were all illegal. The 
last of the Lancashire Witches, Mary Nutter, died naturally in 1828. 


The end came slowly. In Prague, where the war had begun, they were still 
fighting. Monks, students, and townsmen were manning the Charles Bridge 
against an expected Swedish assault. But then, with nine days' delay, news of the 
Peace arrived. 'The clanging of church bells drowned the last thunders of the 
cannon'.- But the troops did not go home. A second congress had to be held at 
Nuremburg in 1650 to settle the indemnities claimed by the armies. The 
Spaniards kept their garrison at Frankenthal in the Palatinate until 1653, when 
the Emperor offered them Besan^on in exchange. The last Swedish soldiers did 
not depart until 1654. Delegates at Westphalia had already started calling it 'the 
Thirty Years War'. In fact, since the first act of violence at Donauworth, it had 
taken up forty-seven years. 

The Pope, Innocent X, was outraged. A lifelong foe of Cardinal Mazarin, 
who had attempted to veto his election, he was offended by the concessions 
made to France and to the Protestants; and he ordered the nuncio at Munster to 
denounce the settlement. In his brief Zelus domus Dei (1650), he described the 
Treaty as 'null, void, invalid, iniquitous, unjust, damnable, reprobate, inane, and 
devoid of meaning for all time'. Behind his anger lay the realization that hopes 
for a united Christendom had been dashed for ever. After Westphalia, people 
who could no longer bear to talk of 'Christendom' began to talk instead of 
'Europe'. 

Germany lay desolate. The population had fallen from 21 million to perhaps 
13 million. Between a third and a half of the people were dead. Whole cities, like 
Magdeburg, stood in ruins. Whole districts lay stripped of their inhabitants, their 
livestock, their supplies. Trade had virtually ceased. A whole generation of 
pillage, famine, disease, and social disruption had wreaked such havoc that in 
the end the princes were forced to reinstate serfdom, to curtail municipal 
liberties, and to nullify the progress of a century. The manly exploits of Spanish, 
Swedish, Italian, Croat, Flemish, and French soldiers had changed the racial 
composition of the people. German culture was so traumatized that art and 
literature passed entirely under the spell of foreign, especially French, fashions. 

Germany's strategic position was greatly weakened. The French now held 





the middle Rhine. The mouths of Germany's three great rivers-Rhine, Elbe, 
and Oder-were held respectively by the Dutch, the Danes, and the Swedes. The 
common interest of the Empire was subject to the separate interests of the larger 
German states: Austria, Bavaria, Saxony, and Brandenburg-Prussia. Destitution 
was accompanied by humiliation. Some historians have seen it as the soil of 
despair which alone can have fed the seeds of virulent German pride that 
sprouted from the recovery of a later age. Austria, which had begun the period as 
the wonder of the age, was reduced to being just one German state among many. 

In the years after 1648, however, Germany was not alone in its misery. Spain 
was struggling with the revolts of Portugal and Catalonia, whilst still at war with 
France. England was in the after-shock of Civil War. France was rocked by the 
Fronde. Poland-Lithuania was torn apart by the Cossack revolt, the Swedish 
'Deluge', and the Russian wars. This concatenation of catastrophes has led to the 
supposition of a general 'seventeenth-century crisis'. Those who believe in the 
existence of an all-European feudal system tend to argue in favour of an all- 
European socio-political revolution caused by the growing pains of all-European 
capitalism. Some argue in contrast in favour of 'a crisis of the modern state', 
where the peripheries reacted violently against the rising demands of the centre. 
Others suspect that it may all have been a coincidence. 

Rome, 19 February 1667. Gianlorenzo Bernini (1598-1680), the papal 
architect, submitted his designs for the third and last section of the great 
colonnade that was nearing completion round the square of St Peter's. He 
proposed that this terzo braccio or third arm of the colonnade should take the 
form of a detached propylaeum or 'gateway' with nine bays surmounted by a 
clock-tower. It was to be positioned at the entrance to the square directly 
opposite the centrepoint of St Peter's facade (see Map 17, p. 570). 

In the giustificazione or 'argument of proposal' which accompanied the 
original plans a dozen years before, Bernini had explained the design and 
symbolism of St Peter's Square. The Square was to provide an approachway to 
the church, a meeting-place for crowds receiving the papal benedictions, and a 
boundary to the holy space. The colonnade was to be permeable, with more gaps 
than columns, thereby facilitating the circulation of pedestrians and avoiding the 
sense of a physical barrier. It was to be covered by a continuous pediment, 
giving protection to processions in inclement weather; and it was to be graced 



above the pediment by a ring of statues, illustrating the communion of saints. Its 
two semicircular arms, which were projected beyond the straight sides of the 
immediate cathedral forecourt, were specifically likened by Bernini to 'the 
enfolding arms of Mother Church', offering comfort to all humanity. The 
proposed propylaeum was to have taken the place of hands clasped in prayer, 
joining the extremities of the Church's outstretched arms. 

As it happened, the cardinals of the Congregazione della Reverenda 
Fabbrica, who managed the building works, had other ideas. They authorized 
the construction of the Piazza's pavement and of a second fountain, but not the 
propylaeum. Shortly afterwards Bernini's ailing papal patron died; and no 
decision was ever made about the terzo braccio. The enclosure of 'the 
amphitheatre of the Christian universe' was left incomplete.- 

As the size of the church demanded, the dimensions of the Square were 
grandiose. Its total length, from the main portico to the western entrance, was 
339 m (370 yds): the maximum width 220 m (240 yds). It could accommodate a 
crowd of 100,000 with no difficulty. The shapes of its connected areas, though 
complex, were brilliantly harmonious. The tapered quadrilaterals in front of the 
facade opened out into an ellipse between the arms of the colonnade. In all, the 
colonnade contained 284 Doric columns and 88 rhomboid pilasters arranged in 
quadruple rows. Its Ionic entablature carried 96 statues, with a further 44 above 
the galleries of the forecourt. The Obelisk of Heliopolis, 41 m (135 ft) high, 
erected in 1586, was left at the focal point of the ellipse. It was flanked on either 
side by a circular fountain, one by Maderna (1614), the other added by Bernini 
in 1667. 



Rome, Ancient and Modern 


The building of Bernini's colonnade terminated a programme of 
reconstruction that had been in progress at St Peter's for 161 years. It concluded 
works which had spanned the whole of the Counter-Reformation. Though a start 
was made in 1506, the greater part of the grand plan drawn up by Bramante, the 
basilica's first architect, had remained on paper throughout the sixteenth century. 
Michelangelo's dome was completed in 1590. Even then, there was no nave; and 
the remnant of Constantine's fourth-century basilica still blocked the old piazza. 
Not until 1605 was Carlo Maderno authorized to demolish the old basilica, and 
to erect the new portico and facade in time for a grand opening on Palm Sunday 
1615. The young Bernini added two lofty campanili or bell-towers to Maderno's 
facade in the 1620s, only to see them pulled down twenty years later. Nominated 
as chief architect in 1628, he was not awarded the remaining 'great 

















commissions' until 1655. The Scala Regia -the chief staircase to the Vatican 
Palace-the Throne of St Peter, and the new Piazza with its colonnade, occupied 
Bernini for the next dozen years.- 

The Rome of Bernini's lifetime was a hive of intrigue and activity where the 
art and politics of the Church combined with the ambitions of the great 
aristocratic clans, the bustling prosperity of traders and artisans, and the grinding 
misery of the plebs. Bernini would have heard of the burning of Giordano 
Bruno, and was present during the trials of Galileo. He would have watched the 
ruin of the Papal States, and the impotence of the popes to intervene in the 
religious wars. He would have seen the Tiber in flood-which inspired one of 
his most spectacular tableaux-the visitations of the plague, and the citizens' 
laments against ever-rising taxes: 

Han' fatto piu danno 
Urbano e nepoti 
Che Vandali e Gothi, 

A Roma mia bella. 

O Papa Gabella! 

(This Pope of the Salt Tax, Urban and his 'nephews', have done more harm to my beautiful Rome than the 
Vandals and the Goths.)- 

It was a mystery how the Church could support such splendour amidst so much 
hardship. 

At 68, Bernini was at the height of his protean powers, and still had a decade 
of creativity before him. He was the son of an engineer-architect in the papal 
service, Pietro Bernino, who among many other things had designed the 'ship 
fountain' in the Piazza di Spagna. From the day he came to Rome with his father 
at the age of eight, he had daily contact with the city's monuments, and enjoyed 
intimate familiarity with cardinals and wealthy patrons. He was personally 
acquainted with eight popes, from the Borghese, Paul V (1605-21) to the 
Odaleschi, Innocent XI (1676-89). Paul V told Bernini's father: 'We hope that 
this boy will become the Michelangelo of his century.' Urban VIII (1623-44) 
told him: 'It is your good fortune, Cavaliere, to see that Cardinal Matteo 
Barberini is now Pope. But our fortune is far greater to see that Cavaliere 
Bernini lives during our pontificate.' Alexander VII (1655-67) summoned him 
to the Vatican and commissioned the final works at St Peter's on the very first 
evening of his reign. 


Bernini was well capable of returning the compliments. Pleased by Louis 
XIV's ability to stand still during modelling, he said: 'Sire, I always knew that 
you were great in great things. I now know that you are also great in little 
things.' And he knew how to flatter the ladies. 'All women are beautiful,' he 
once announced. 'But under the skin of Italian women runs blood, under the skin 
of French women- milk.' 

By profession Bernini was a sculptor. He performed the most prodigious 
feats of skill and artistry from his earliest years. His first major commissions, 
such as Aenea, Anchise e Ascanio (1618-19), which portrayed a muscular figure 
carrying an older man across his shoulders, were executed in his teens. His last 
commissions, such as the extraordinary Tomb of Alexander VII, which portrayed 
Truth in the daring form of a female nude, were still in the making 60 years later. 
His work was characterized by the tension produced from the competing 
qualities of realism and fantasy. His portraits in stone could be shockingly 
lifelike: at the unveiling of the bust of Monsignor Montoia, the Pope addressed 
the statue and said, 'Now this is the monsignor', then, turning to Montoia, 'and 
this is a remarkable likeness.' The dramatic poses, the dynamic bodily and facial 
gestures, and unfailingly original designs brought spiritual power to the most 
hackneyed subjects.- 

According to the connoisseur Filippo Baldinucci, who wrote the first 
biography, Bernini possessed two supreme virtues-ingenuity and audacity. 'His 
highest merit lay in ... making beautiful things out of the inadequate and the ill- 
adapted.' Above all, he betrayed no fear of the unconventional. 'Those who do 
not sometimes go outside the rules', he once said, 'never go beyond them.'- 

The catalogue of Bernini's sculptures runs into several hundred items. The 
best known among them included the portraits of Charles I of England (1638), 
executed from a painting by Van Dyck, and of Louis XIV of France (1665), The 
Rape of Proserpina, the David, who is arched backwards to tense the catapult, 
The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa, The Death of Beata Albertoni, Truth Unveiled by 
Time, and the tomb of Urban VIII, where the angel of death is shown writing the 
book of history. 

Sculpture, however, was only Bernini's starting-point. It provided his entree 
into artistic compositions which called for the broadest co-ordination of all the 
arts. His expertise extended to decoration, painting, and architecture as well as 
sculpture. In St Peter's, it is met at every turn: in the fantastically threaded 
bronze pillars of the Baldacchino (1632) of the high altar; in the decoration of 


the piers supporting the dome; in the bas-relief over the front door, and the 
multicoloured marble floor of the arcade; in the bronze and lapis lazuli ciborium 
of the Chapel of the Sacrament-the 'holiest of holies in the greatest temple of 
Christendom'. 

Bernini's abundant contributions to the city of Rome ran to no fewer than 45 
major buildings. He built the stupendous Fontana del Tritone (1643), where the 
Triton spouts a jet of water from a conch as he sits in a broader shell held aloft 
by three dolphins; and he was part-author of the Fontana dei Fiumi in the Piazza 
Navona, with its portrayal of the four great rivers of the world-the Nile, 
Ganges, Danube, and Plate. He built the facade of the College for the 
Propagation of the Faith, the Jesuit Church of S. Andrea di Monte Cavallo, and 
the town church of Castelgandolfo. He restored the Quirinal and Chigi palaces, 
and the Arsenal at Civitavecchia. 

In the eyes of contemporaries, Bernini's most appreciated talents lay in the 
realm of scenography. Posterity is a loser from the fact that much inventive 
energy was thrown into plays, masques, carnivals, and processions, which were 
staged on a heroic scale but which left no record. In 1661 he decorated the hill of 
S. Trinita del Monte for a firework display celebrating the birth of the French 
Dauphin. In 1669 he organized a famous show to mark the defence of Crete. In 
the theatre of the Tor' di Nona (1670-6) he worked with playwrights, stage 
designers, actors, and composers such as Corelli and Scarlatti. Theatricality is 
often mentioned as the spirit of Baroque. In this respect, Bernini must be 
described as the most spirited practitioner of the genre. 

Bernini's failures were few but wounding. The demolition of his bell-towers 
at St Peter's must be attributed to the ill will of rival advisers under Innocent X. 
But the fiasco of his foray into France in 1665 was less explicable. The project 
started with a flattering invitation from Colbert, who described him in a letter as 
'the admiration of the whole world'. He travelled to Paris, taking plans with him 
for the construction of an amphitheatrical building, based on the Colosseum, to 
fill the space between the Louvre and the Tuileries. But the plans were rejected, 
and he returned home six months later, his dismay sweetened only by the 
memory of the jolly sittings with Louis XIV. At the very end of his career, when 
cracks appeared in the stonework of the piers under the crossing of St Peter's, 
Bernini was blamed for the fault. Baldinucci was inspired to write his book in 
order to disprove these accusations. 

In 1667 Pope Alexander VII was almost exactly Bernini's contemporary. As 



Cardinal Fabio Chigi, he had been a career diplomat. Serving as Nuncio in 
Cologne throughout the 1640s, he was the Vatican's chief negotiator in the 
settlement of the Thirty Years War, where he gained the reputation for opposing 
all concessions to the Protestants. He thoroughly approved of Bernini's quip, 
'Better a bad Catholic than a good heretic.' He was a devotee of St Francis de 
Sales, whom he canonized, was friendly to the Jesuits, and took a harsh line 
against Jansenism. In short, he was a model Counter-Reformation pope. At the 
same time he was a man of great literary and artistic refinement. Himself a 
published Latin poet, he was a collector of books and a determined patron of the 
arts. He was already employing Bernini on the Chigi residences when still 
Secretary of State, before summoning him on that first evening of his pontificate. 

Alexander's chief rival as Rome's leading patron was undoubtedly ex-Queen 
Christina of Sweden. Arriving in Rome in the December after Alexander's 
election, Christina was the most famous Catholic convert of her age. A forceful 
intellectual, she turned the Palazzo Riario into a salon of wit and taste and, 
through the squadro volante (action group) of Cardinal Azzelino, into a hotbed 
of ecclesiastical intrigue. Her lesbian leanings, and her longing for the cerebral 
kind of Catholicism by which Descartes had originally been impressed, made her 
a poor fit in Alexander's puritanical Rome. 

Seen from Rome, Christendom had reached a sorry pass. By the 1660s the long 
struggle against Protestantism had reached stalemate. Hopes of embracing the 
Orthodox were lost. With the exception of France, all the leading Catholic 
powers were in disarray; and France, like Portugal, was in tacit rebellion against 
the Pope's authority. The Empire under Leopold I was ravaged and depopulated: 
Poland-Lithuania likewise; Spain was bankrupt. 

In northern Europe, all sorts of conflict took place without any reference to 
Rome. As soon as England made peace with the Netherlands by the Treaty of 
Breda, the French made war on Spanish Flanders. Restoration England had just 
survived the plague and the Great Fire of London, celebrated in Dryden's Annus 
Mirabilis. In the East, at Andrusovo, the Orthodox Muscovites were tempting 
Poland to cede Ukraine, and threatening to tip the balance in perpetuity. 
Brandenburg Prussia, recently independent, was poised to unseat the Swedes as 
the leading Protestant military power. 

In the Balkans and the Mediterranean, the Turks were in the ascendant. The 
Venetians were hanging grimly onto their last Cretan stronghold at Candia 



(Heraklion). The Papal States, like the rest of Italy, were suffering a dramatic 
economic decline. It was inexplicable how they supplied the revenue to pay for 
Bernini's extravaganzas, and for the Venetian subsidies. For all its magnificence, 
Catholic Rome was tangibly reaching the end of its greatest days. 

The Vatican's quarrel with France was rooted in the grievances of the late 
Cardinal Mazarin. Mazarin could not forgive Rome for giving shelter to his bete 
noire, Cardinal de Retz, Archbishop of Paris. He took his revenge by helping the 
Farnese and the d'Este in their dispute over property in the Papal States. For his 
trouble, he was excluded from the Conclave of 1655 that elected Alexander VII, 
on the grounds that cardinals needed the permission of the Curia to assume 
permanent residence abroad. Louis XIV had chosen to continue the feud after 
Mazarin's death. On the pretext that the immunity of the French embassy in 
Rome had been infringed, he expelled the Nuncio from Paris and occupied 
Avignon. The hapless Alexander was obliged to offer humiliating apologies, and 
to erect a pyramid in Rome inscribed with an admission of the offences of the 
Pope's own servants. Relations were not improved by the humiliation felt in the 
Vatican in 1665 from Bernini's abortive visit to Versailles. Bernini may have 
scored a great success with Louis: by parting the King's wig during one of the 
sittings, he inspired an instant hairstyle known as la modification Bemin. But no 
one could fail to see, in taste as in politics and religion, that France was 
determined to set her own course. Versailles was to take no notice when the 
Vatican opposed the persecution of the Huguenots. 

In literature, 1667 saw the publication both of Racine's Andromaque and of 
Milton's Paradise Lost. The former, set in ancient Troy, confirmed the 
continuing vitality of the classical tradition, as well as the supremacy of French 
letters. The latter's matchless cadences confirmed the enduring appeal of 
Christian themes: 

Of Man's first disobedience, and the fruit 
Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste 
Brought death into the World, and all our woe, 

With loss of Eden, till one greater Man 
Restore us, and regain the blissful seat, 

Sing, Heavenly Muse,... 

That to the highth of this great Argument 
I may assert eternal Providence, 

And Justine the ways of God to men.- 


Bernini's creative contemporaries were at every possible stage in their varied 
careers. In Amsterdam, with The Jewish Bride, Rembrandt was painting his last 
major canvas. In Madrid, Murillo was engaged on a series of 22 paintings for the 
Church of the Capuchins. In Paris, Claude Lorrain painted Europa. In London, 
in the wake of the Great Fire, Christopher Wren was planning his spectacular 
series of churches; and Richard Lower performed the first human blood 
transfusion. In Cambridge, the young Isaac Newton had just cracked the theory 
of colours. In Oxford, Hooke was proposing systematic meteorological 
recordings. In Munich, the Theatinerkirche was in mid-construction. In February 
1667 Frans Hals, the portraitist, had just died; Jonathan Swift, the satirist, was 
being conceived. 

There can be no doubt that the protracted reconstruction of St Peter's 
constituted a central event in the era of Church reform. St Peter's was not just a 
building; it was the chief temple and symbol of the loyalty against which Luther 
had rebelled, and to which the Pope's own divisions had rallied. It is also true 
that the building of Bernini's colonnade marked a definite stage in that story. For 
the sake of convenience, historians can be tempted to say that it marks the end of 
the Counter-Reformation. And so, in a sense, it does. 

Yet, in reality, the Counter-Reformation did not come to an end, just as the 
colonnade was never really finished. The history of civilization is a continuum 
which has few simple stops and starts. The Roman Church was already being 
overshadowed by the rise of the secular powers; but it did not cease to be a 
prominent feature of European life. The ideals of the Counter-Reformation 
continued to be pressed for centuries. Its institutions are still in operation nearly 
400 years later. Indeed, the mission of the Roman Church will not have ceased 
so long as the pilgrims crowd into St Peter's Square, pray before St Peter's 
Throne, and mingle with the tourists under Bernini's Colonnade.

LUMEN 

Enlightenment and Absolutism, c.1650-1789 


There is an air of naivety about the so-called 'Age of 
Reason'. In restrospect it seems extraordinary that so 
many of Europe's leading intellects should have given 
such weight to one human faculty-Reason-at the 
expense of all the others. Naivety of such proportions, 
one might conclude, was heading for a fall; and a fall, in 
the shape of the terrible revolutionary years, is what the 
Age of Reason eventually encountered. 


In the periods both before and after, the virtues of Reason were much less 
appreciated. On seeing his father's ghost, Shakespeare's Hamlet had told his 
doubting companion, There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than 
are dreamt of in your philosophy.' In the nineteenth century, too, rationalism was 
out of fashion: 

enlightenment ... 2. Shallow and pretentious intellectualism, unreasonable 
contempt for authority and tradition, etc.; applied esp. to the spirit and aims of 







the French philosophers of the 18th C. 1865.- 

On the other hand, when judging the period which followed the 
Reformations, one must remember what Europeans had been contending with 
for so long. The consensus between Reason and Faith, as promised by the 
Renaissance humanists, had not prevailed against the world of religious dogma, 
magic, and superstition. After the Wars of Religion, one can see that the exercise 
of 'the Light of sweet Reason' was a natural and necessary antidote. Indeed, 
even the full flood of the Enlightenment may only have washed over the surface 
of continuing bigotries. 

Similar problems surround the label of the 'Age of Absolutism' which 
political historians apply to this same period. One might easily be led to imagine 
that most European rulers of the time either enjoyed absolute powers or at least 
sought to do so. Such, alas, was not the case. Europeans in the Age of 
Absolutism were no more uniform absolutists than they were uniform 
rationalists. 


" - " 


In the century and a half between the Peace of Westphalia and the French 
Revolution, the map of Europe underwent few radical changes. Each of the wars 
of the period ended with a certain amount of territorial trading. The Treaty of 
Utrecht (1713), in particular, caused a stir; and the first partition of Poland- 
Lithuania (1773) signalled the onset of an avalanche. The unification of the 
island of Great Britain (1707) confirmed the emergence of an important new 
unit. But most of the main blocs on the map remained essentially intact. France's 
drive to the Rhine was only partly successful; Prussia had to be content with 
relatively modest gains; the Ottomans' last great surge was contained and then 
reversed. Russia alone continued to grow dramatically. None of Europe's 
invalids actually perished: Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, Sweden, and Poland- 
Lithuania all ailed, but all survived. 

The range of political systems was far greater than most textbooks allow (see 
Appendix III, p. 1265). In this 'Age of Absolutism', absolutist states actually 
formed a minority. Between the completely decentralized, constitutional, and 
republican confederation of Switzerland at one end of the scale and the extreme 
autocracies in Russia, the Ottoman Empire, and the Papal States at the other, 
great variety flourished. Europe's republics were represented by Venice, Poland- 




Lithuania, and the United Provinces; the constitutional monarchies at various 
times by England, Scotland, and Sweden; the absolutist monarchies by France, 
Spain, and Austria. The Holy Roman Empire, with monarch both elected and 
hereditary, fell somewhere between the republics and the constitutional 
monarchies; Prussia, which operated constitutional structures according to an 
authoritarian tradition, fell somewhere between constitutionalism and 
absolutism. Even greater variety can be found among Europe's Kleinstaaterei - 
the hundreds of petty states which the younger Pitt would once call in 
exasperation 'the swarm of gnats'. There were miniature city-republics like 
Ragusa (Dubrovnik), Genoa, or Geneva; there were miniature principalities like 
Courland; ecclesiastical states like Avignon, and curious hybrids like Andorra. 

What is more, many European states continued to be conglomerates, where 
the ruler had to operate a different system within each of the constituent 
territories. The kings of Prussia had to conduct themselves in one way in Berlin, 
where they were imperial subjects, in another way in Konigsberg, where they 
were completely independent, and in yet other ways in possessions such as 
Minden or Neuchatel. The Habsburgs could be figureheads in the Empire, 
despots in Prague or Vienna, and constitutional monarchs after 1713 in Brussels. 
The British kings could be constitutional monarchs at home and autocrats in the 
colonies. 

There were also important variations over time. England, for example, 
veered in the republican direction under Cromwell, in the monarchical direction 
after the restoration of the Stuarts, and back to its greatly admired centrist 
position after the 'Bloodless Revolution' of 1688-9. In the late seventeenth 
century both the Swedish and the Danish monarchies headed rapidly towards 
absolutism. In eighteenth-century Sweden the 'Hats' and 'Caps' moved headlong 
in the opposite direction. Under John Sobieski (r. 1674-96) Poland-Lithuania 
still functioned according to rules of the noble democracy. After 1717 it could 
only function as a Russian protectorate. In Russia the Tsars acted as unashamed 
autocrats; in Poland they posed as the champions of 'Golden Freedom'. 
Appearances, and simple categories, deceive. 

Absolutism, in particular, must be viewed with circumspection. It was 
something less than the autocracy of tsars and sultans, who faced no institutional 
obstacle to the exercise of their will. Yet it was something more than the 
authoritarian spirit which enabled certain monarchs to follow the Prussian 
example and to dragoon the institutions with which they were supposed to co- 



operate. It clearly had its roots in the late feudal period, where struggling 
monarchies had to combat the entrenched privileges both of the provinces and of 
the nobility, and in the Catholic world, where the Roman Church remained 
immune from direct political control. It did not usually fit the conditions of 
either the Protestant or the Orthodox world. At various stages France, Spain, 
Austria, and Portugal came definitely within its purview. For various reasons 
Britain, Prussia, Poland-Lithuania, and Russia did not. 

Absolutism, one should stress, refers more to an ideal than to the practical 
realities of government. It was concerned with a set of political ideas and 
assumptions which came into existence as a corrective to the excessively 
decentralized institutions left over from the late medieval era. It often stood for 
little more than the 'personal power' of certain monarchs as opposed to the 
'limited powers' of others whose authority was curtailed by Diets, autonomous 
provinces, municipal charters, exempted nobles, and clergy. It could not be 
easily defined, and was often justified more in the panegyrical tones of courtiers 
than in the detailed arguments of philosophers. It had many a Bossuet or a 
Boileau, but only one Hobbes. It was probably better illustrated in some of its 
minor examples, such as Tuscany, than in any of the major powers. Nowhere did 
it achieve complete success: nowhere did it bring a perfectly absolute state into 
existence. Yet in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it certainly provided a 
radical force for change. In the eighteenth century, when its influence was 
becoming more diffuse, it was overtaken by new trends for democracy, liberty, 
and the general will. The age of the 'enlightened despots' was equally the era of 
British and American constitutionalism. 

One must also be aware that shouts of 'absolutism' were frequently raised in 
a misleading way. When the English gentry complained about the absolutism of 
the Stuarts, they were less perturbed by the actual balance of power between 
King and Parliament than by fears of the imposition of French or Spanish 
practices. When the Polish nobles took to screaming about the 'absolutism' of 
their Saxon kings, whose position in Poland-Lithuania was more limited than 
that of any limited monarch, they were simply objecting to change. 

The absolutism of France served as the main point of reference. Under Louis 
XTV (r. 1643-1715), whose reign was the longest in European history, France 
was far and away Europe's greatest power; and her example excited numerous 
admirers. Yet the greatest of absolutists died disillusioned, convinced that the 
ideal lay out of reach. 



In the end, therefore, absolutism proved a dismal failure. The Ancien Regime 
created by Louis XIV was to end in the disaster of a Revolution which, whilst 
turning France into the apostle of republicanism, brought French supremacy to a 
close. The ultimate triumph was to be enjoyed by Absolutism's most doughty 
opponents. British constitutionalism inspired not only the leading power of the 
nineteenth century but also, via the constitution of Britain's rebel colonies, the 
world's leading superpower of the twentieth. 

Europe's colonies and overseas possessions continued to multiply after 1650, 
and in some cases reached independent viability. Spain and Portugal had their 
hands full exploiting their existing possessions. In North America, the Spaniards 
pressed inland from New Spain (Mexico) to California, Arizona, Colorado. In 
South America, aided by systematic Jesuit settlements, they concentrated their 
efforts on Venezuela, on New Granada (Bogota), on Peru, Paraguay, and La 
Plata (Cordoba). They attempted to keep all trade to their own ships, until forced 
by the Asiento Treaty of 1713 to admit foreigners. The Portuguese survived a 
long campaign by the Dutch to take over the Brazilian coast. After the treaty of 
1662, they moved south from Sao Paulo to the River Plate (1680) and westwards 
into the gold-rich interior at Minas Gerais (1693) and the Matto Grosso. Apart 
from the East Indies, the Dutch were left with colonies in Guyana and Curasao. 
The Russians, who had discovered what was later to be named the Bering Strait 
in 1648, occupied Kamchatka (1679) and signed a border treaty with China on 
the Amur (1689). A century later, after the explorations of the Dane Vitus Bering 
(1680-1741), they established a fort on Kodiak Island (1783) and claimed 
Alaska (1791), whence they sent out an offshoot to Fort Ross in northern 
California (1812). 

Most new colonial enterprises, however, were started by the French and the 
British. France launched the Compagnie des Indes in 1664, establishing stations 
on the east coast of India at Pondicherry and Karaikal, with staging-posts on the 
islands of Madagascar and Reunion. In 1682 Louisiana was founded on the 
Mississippi in honour of Louis XIV, with its capital at New Orleans (1718). 
England consolidated its American colonies with the foundation of Delaware 
(1682), of the Quaker colony of Pennsylvania (1683), and of Georgia (1733). In 
India the East India Company, which now held Bombay and Calcutta as well as 
Madras, was hard-pressed by French competition. Commercial interests went 
hand in hand with maritime discovery. In 1766-8 the French admiral 
Bougainville circumnavigated the globe, as did the three expeditions of Captain 



James Cook RN between 1768 and 1780. In the circumstances, Franco-British 
colonial conflicts became almost inevitable. They were settled by superior 
British naval power. Great Britain took Newfoundland in 1713, French India in 
1757, and French Canada in 1759-60, thereby confirming its status as the prime 
colonial power. 

Colonialism was very much confined to those maritime states which first 
began it. The German states, Austria, and the Italian states did not take part. In 
this they lagged behind the Polish fief of Courland, whose Duke bought Tobago 
in 1645 and briefly maintained a trading-post in the Gambia; or Denmark, whose 
West India Company obtained both St Thomas and St John (1671) and St Croix 
(1733). 

The impact of Europe's growing contacts with distant continents and cultures 
cannot be exaggerated. Europe had long been shut in on itself. Knowledge of 
civilizations beyond Europe was meagre. Fantastic tales, like that of 'El 
Dorado', abounded. But now a steady stream of detailed accounts of India, 
China, or the American Frontier began to stimulate more serious reflection. Les 
Six Voyages (1676) of J. B. Tavernier (1605-89), who made great wealth in 
Persia, started a genre written in the same vein as the celebrated New Voyage 
round the World (1697) of the buccaneer William Dampier (1652-1715), the 
History of Japan (1727) by the German surgeon Engelbert Kaempfer (1651- 
1716), or the later Travels in Arabia of the Swiss J. L. Burckhardt (1784-1817), 
the first European to visit Mecca. The Strange, Surprizing Adventures of 
Robinson Crusoe (1719), the world's first popular novel, was written by the 
English satirist, Daniel Defoe (1659-1731), on the basis of the real experiences 
of a Scots sailor marooned on Juan Fernandez Island off Valparaiso by Dampier. 
These works often gave European readers a comparative perspective on the 
religions, folklore, and culture of the world; and they handed the philosophers of 
the Enlightenment one of their most effective devices for questioning European 
or Christian assumptions. It hit Europeans hard to learn that the Siamese might 
be happier, the Brahmin more sagacious, or the Iroquois less bloodthirsty than 
they were themselves. It is a curious fact that Jesuit authors, who excelled in 
travelogues of the ethnological type, provided the very ammunition with which 
their own intellectual world was most effectively bombarded. Here one would 
mention the description of Amerindian life in Canada by Fr. J.-F. Lafitau (1670- 
1740) or the much-translated memoir of Persia by Fr. T. Krusiriski SJ (1675- 
1756), published in 1733. 



International relations were clearly affected by the colonial factor. Almost all 
the wars of the period had naval or colonial theatres which were fought over in 
parallel to the main military conflict on the Continent. The great land powers- 
France, Spain, Austria, and increasingly Pmssia and Russia-had to take 
account of the wealthy maritime powers, especially the British and the Dutch, 
who, whilst possessing few troops of their own, could play a vital role as 
paymasters, quartermasters, and weavers of diplomatic coalitions. 

Diplomacy was increasingly governed by the Balance of Power-a doctrine 
which viewed any change in one part of Europe as a potential threat to the 
whole. This was a sure sign that a 'European system' was coming into being. 
And colonial assets were an integral part of the equation. The system was of 
particular interest to the British, who instinctively opposed any preponderant 
Continental power and who made a fine art of maintaining the Balance at 
minimum cost to themselves. International relations of this sort entirely lacked 
the moral and religious fervour of previous times. They were often reduced 
almost to a form of ritual, where the current state of the Balance was tested in 
set-piece battles fought by small professional armies; where elegant officers of 
both sides belonged to the same international confraternity of arms; and where 
the result was nicely calculated in territory ceded or gained. Territorial 
possessions were viewed rather like casino chips that rulers lost or amassed 
according to the fortunes of war, with no thought for the interests of the 
inhabitants. Like Westphalia, all the great congresses of the subsequent era- 
Utrecht (1713), Vienna (1738), Aix-la-Chapelle (1748), and Paris (1763)-were 
conducted in the same spirit of cheerful cynicism. 

Economic life, too, was greatly affected by the colonies. Europe was 
increasingly divided into countries which could benefit from colonial commerce 
and those which could not. Britain benefited most, especially after Utrecht, 
gaining a predominant hold on the Atlantic trade in sugar, tobacco, and slaves, 
from which Liverpool, Glasgow, and Bristol grew rich. Britain's policy of 
enforcing a blockade on enemy ports in time of war led to constant trouble not 
only with France and Spain but also with the neutrals-Dutch, Danes, and 
Swedes-who had specialized in smuggling, raiding, and blockade-running. In 
Britain, in emulation of the Dutch, this period saw the growth of all the 
permanent institutions of public credit-the Bank of England (1694), the Royal 
Exchange, and the National Debt. The first steps of the Industrial Revolution 
were taken in the 1760s. [cap-ag] 



Britain produced John Law (1671-1729), a racy Scots financier, who 
invented the first experiment for harnessing colonial trade to popular capitalism. 
His grand 'Scheme' and Banque royale (1716-20) in Paris, which was 
patronized by the Regent, and which coincided with the similarly disastrous 
South Sea Company in London, created a veritable fever of speculation by 
selling paper shares in the future of Louisiana. The Bubble burst; thousands, if 
not millions, of investors were ruined, Law fled, and France was permanently 
inoculated against credit operations. Meanwhile, the commercial operations of 
Law's company thrived; and the value of French overseas commerce quadrupled 
between 1716 and 1743. 

In Central and Eastern Europe, few such developments occurred. Land 
remained the major source of wealth; serfdom reigned supreme; inland trade 
could not compare to its maritime counterpart. Germany's recovery was slow, 
Bohemia's somewhat faster; Poland-Lithuania after 1648 experienced an 
absolute economic regression from which it never recovered. Baltic trade passed 
increasingly to Russia, where the foundation of St Petersburg (1701) opened its 
'window to the West'. 

Social life, despite the recurrence of violent outbursts, remained within its 
established channels until the opening of the floodgates in 1789. Extremes of 
wealth among the aristocracy and of misery among the peasants were normal. 
Differences between Western and Eastern Europe were growing, but not 
dramatic. Even in Britain, where commercial pressures were greatest, the landed 
aristocracy maintained its supremacy. Indeed since the English lords were not 
averse to commercial activities like canal-building or coalmining, their pre¬ 
eminence was prolonged. This was the age of the grandees and the magnates- 
the Medina Sidonia and Osuna in Spain, the Brahes and Bondes in Sweden, the 
Schwarzenbergs in Austria, the Esterhazy in Hungary, the Lobkowitz in 
Bohemia, the Radziwitt and the Zamoyski in Poland-each with a vast 
latifundium protected by entail, a princely life-style, and enormous patronial 
power, [SZLACHTA] 


CAP-AG 


In volume 70 of the journal Past and Present (1976), an American historian 




advanced a hypothesis on 'Agrarian Class Structure and Economic 
Development in Pre-industrial Europe'. He was questioning the established 
view which attributed economic change to the pressures of rising population. 
Starting from contrasts between England and France, he argued that the key 
to England's precocity and France's retardation lay in their different class 
structures. Whereas the landlord class in England had created a flourishing 
system of agrarian capitalism, 'the most complete freedom and property 
rights for the rural population [in France] meant poverty and a self- 
perpetuating cycle of backwardness'. 1 

An elaborate historians' debate raged in the journal's next seventeen 
issues. Volume 78 carried a symposium on 'Population and Class Relations 
in Feudal Society', a second joint critique of the hypothesis, and an 
exposition of 'Peasant Organization and Class in East and West Germany'. 
Volume 79 carried two still more hostile pieces, one lamenting 'the confused 
view of manorial development' and another, from the star of French rural 
history, which pummelled the Brenner thesis with a comprehensive eighteen- 
point 'Reply'. Volume 85 extended the debate to 'Pre-industrial Bohemia'. 
At last, in volume 97, Professor Brenner's long-awaited rejoinder stretched 
matters still further by expounding his views on 'the agrarian roots of 
European Capitalism'. 

Debates of this sort are the chosen method for historical specialists to 
bridge the gaps in existing knowledge. They appear to have two weaknesses. 
They use tiny samples to make huge generalizations; and they are 
shamelessly inconclusive. If engineers were to approach their subject in the 
same spirit, no river would ever be bridged. 

A solution of sorts, however, was to hand. In the same year that the 
Brenner debate was launched, another American scholar took the same 
subject of 'capitalist agriculture' and used it to explain 'the origins of a 
world-economy'.- By applying the techniques of systems theory, Immanuel 
Wallerstein was able to locate a 'core' of the European economy in the West 
and a dependent 'periphery' in the East. In his view, the core region, which 
consisted of England, the Netherlands, northern France, and western 
Germany, had possessed only a 'slight edge' in the fifteenth century. But 
they were able to exploit their advantage through favourable trading 
relations, and to set up the conditions which transformed the feudal nobilities 
of Eastern Europe into a capitalist landowning class. They also projected 




their growing economic power into the New World. As a result, they created 
the familiar framework where 'coercive, cash-crop capitalism' took hold 
both of colonial and of East European agriculture. Whilst the core countries 
flourished, the serfs of Pmssia, Bohemia, Poland, and Hungary were reduced 
to the status of plantation blacks. Once established, the system could only 
magnify its imbalances. 'The slight edge of the fifteenth century became the 
great disparity of the seventeenth and the monumental difference of the 
nineteenth. 

The hypothesis soon came under fire from the specialists, not least from 
Brenner. Wallerstein was accused of oversimplification, of overemphasis on 
trade, even of 'neo-Smithianism'.- It turns out that the 'Polish model', which 
was central to his argument, did not hold good even for the whole of Poland, 
and was largely invented. The Hungarian beef trade, it seems, was not run by 
nobles or capitalist middlemen, but by free, wage-earning peasants. The 
Russian and the Ottoman elements in European trade had been ignored. 
Instead of a micro-theory which could not sustain generalizations, here was a 
macro-theory, which could not bear the specifics. 

In the end, the most interesting aspect of Wallerstein's work was the light 
which it shed on the relations of Eastern and Western Europe. Though the 
postulate of a core and a dependent periphery had not been proved, the 
interdependence of all parts of Europe had been amply demonstrated. 


In many countries the nobility was now mobilized for the service of the state. 
In France and in Russia, this was achieved in a formal, systematic way. Louis 
XIV introduced a hierarchy of ranks and titles, each supported by suitable 
pensions, starting with the enfants de France (royal family) and the pairs 
(princes of the blood, together with 50 dukes and 7 bishops) and ending with the 
cadres of the noblesse d'epee (the old military families) and the noblesse de robe 
(civilian courtiers). Peter the Great introduced a service nobility divided into 14 
ranks and even more strictly dependent on state employment. In Prussia the 
alliance between the Crown and the Junkers was more informal but no less 
effective. The petty nobility, which was particularly numerous in Spain and in 
Poland, was squeezed into the retinues of the magnates, into military service, or 
into foreign employment. In England, in the absence of serfdom, the Enclosure 
movement could capitalize on landholding most effectively. A prosperous 





stratum of yeomen and gentleman farmers developed at the expense of peasants 
driven from the land. 

In all the great cities of Europe there was a wealthy commercial and 
professional class, alongside the artisanate, the urban poor, and, in two or three 
localities, the beginnings of an industrial work-force. Generally speaking, 
however, the old institutions of the social Estates remained intact. The nobles 
kept their Diets, the cities their charters and their guilds, the peasantry their 
corvees and their famines. Social changes were undoubtedly taking place, but 
within the established framework. When the shell finally cracked, as it did in 
France in 1789, the social explosion was to be unprecedented, [pugachev] 


SZLACHTA 

According to an inventory of 1739, Stanislaw Lubomirski (1719-83) had 
inherited latifundium of 1,071 landed estates. They stretched right across the 
nine southern palatinates of Poland, from the family seat at Wisnicz near 
Cracow to Tetiev near Kiev in Ukraine, and were worked by close to a 
million serfs. Grand Marshal of the Crown from 1766, Lubomirski could 
have laid claim to be Europe's largest private landowner. Allied by marriage 
and politics to the related clans of the Czartoryski, Poniatowski, and 
Zamoyski, he certainly belonged to the most powerful circle of magnates in 
the land. Each of them possessed vast estates, a private army, and an income 
larger than the king's. They stood at the pinnacle of a social system whose 
noble estate-the szlachta -was the most numerous in Europe. 

The magnates, however, were highly untypical of the nobility as a whole. 
By the mid-eighteenth century an absolute majority of Polish nobles had 
become landless. They survived by renting properties, by serving the 
magnates, or even by working the land like peasants. Yet no amount of 
economic degradation could deprive them of what they prized most-their 
noble blood, their herb or 'coat of arms', their legal status, and their right to 
bequeath it to their children, [crux] 

Poland's drobna szlachta or 'petty nobility' was absolutely inimitable. In 
certain provinces, such as Mazovia, they made up a quarter of the 




population. In some districts, where they built walled villages to separate 
themselves from the peasantry, the zascianki or 'nobles-behind-the-wall' 
constituted the whole population. They preserved their way of life with 
fierce determination, addressing each other as Pan or Pani, 'Lord and Lady', 
and the peasants as Ty, 'Thou'. They regarded all nobles as brothers, and 
everyone else as inferiors. They reserved the severest penalties for anyone 
falsely masquerading as a noble, and jealously guarded the procedures of 
ennoblement. They engaged in no trade, except for soldiering and land 
management. They always rode into town, if only on a nag; and they wore 
carmine capes and weapons, if only symbolic wooden swords. Their houses 
may have been hovels; but they had to have a porch on which to display the 
family shield. Above all, they insisted that Prince Lubomirski and his like 
were their equals. 

The most prominent feature of the szlachta, therefore, was the 
tremendous contrast between their economic stratification and their legal, 
cultural, and political solidarity. Unlike their counterparts elsewhere in 
Europe, they admitted no native titles. There were no Polish barons, 
marquises, or counts. The most they would do was to confirm the personal 
titles which some of their number had gained in Lithuania before the union 
of 1569 or which, like the Lubomirskis, had been granted by pope or 
emperor. 

In legal terms, Poland's noble estate came to an end when the laws 
governing its status were abolished by the Partitions. Some, like the 
Lubomirskis, managed to confirm their nobility in Austria or in Prussia. A 
few did so in Russia, though 80 per cent of them there lost their status, 
forming a declasse reservoir of anti-Russian discontent that raged throughout 
the nineteenth century. In 1921, when the Polish Republic was restored, a 
democratic Polish Sejm formally confirmed the abolition of noble 
privilege.Yet the szlachta's consciousness of their special identity survived 
all manner of catastrophes. As late as the 1950s, sociologists found 
collective farmers in Mazovia who shunned their 'peasant' neighbours, 
dressed differently, spoke differently, and observed complex betrothal 
customs to prevent intermarriage. In 1990, when Poland's Communist 
regime collapsed, there were still young Poles who would wear a signet ring 
with a coat of arms, just to show who they were. By then, everyone in 
Poland addressed each other as Pan and Pani. The 'noble culture' had 
become a major ingredient of the culture of the whole nation. 



Nobility played a central part in social and political life all over early 
modern Europe. But the only place where the Polish model was matched, 
even in part, was in Spain, where the grandees and hidalgos of the West 
resembled the magnates and petty gentry of the East. 1 


Cultural life burgeoned under royal, ecclesiastical, and aristocratic patronage. 
The European arts entered the era of Classicism, where, in reaction to the 
Baroque, rules, rigour, and restraint were the order of the day. Architecture saw a 
return to the Greek and Roman styles of the Renaissance, with a touch of gaudy 
or rococo ornamentation. The outstanding buildings were palaces and public 
offices. Urban planning, formal, geometric gardens, and landscape design gained 
prominence. The obsession was to reduce the chaos of the natural world to order 
and harmony. The show cities, after Paris, were Dresden, Vienna, and St 
Petersburg. 

Painting had passed its precocious peak. In France the classical landscapes 
and mythological scenes of Nicolas Poussin (1594-1665), Claude Lorrain 
(1600-82), and Charles Le Brun (1619-90) were succeeded by the idyllic 
frivolities painted by J. A. Watteau (1684-1721) and J.-H. Fragonard (1732- 
1806). The English school of social portraiture, which began with Godfrey 
Kneller (1646-1723), culminated in the superlative work of Joshua Reynolds 
(1723-92) and Thomas Gainsborough (1727-88). The two Canalettos (1697- 
1768, 1724-80) left realistic panoramas of Venice, London, and Warsaw. Except 
for occasional figures of stature, such as G. B. Tiepolo (1693-1770) in Venice, 
religious painting was in decline. Interior decoration, and furniture in particular, 
responded to aristocratic demand. The cabinet-makers of Paris, led by A. C. 
Boulle (1642-1732), took advantage of exotic imports such as ebony, mahogany, 
and satinwood; Boulle specialized in marquetry and inlaid ebony. Their 
creations, now instantly recognizable as 'Louis XIV", 'Louis XV', or 'Louis 
XVI', eventually found their match in the work of Grinling Gibbons (1648- 
1721) and Thomas Chippendale (d. 1779). Fine porcelain owed much to imports 
from China. The royal factory at Saint Cloud (1696) and later Sevres (1756) had 
counterparts at Meissen (1710) in Saxony, at St Petersburg (1744), at Worcester 
(1751), and at the 'Etruria 5 factory (1769) of Josiah Wedgwood (1730-95). Silk, 
silver, and sumptuous sundries saturated the salons. 




PUGACHEV 


Since peasants formed by far the largest social class in modern Europe and 
the Russian empire by far the largest state, it is not surprising to find that the 
greatest peasant revolts took place in the heartland of Russia. There were 
four-those of Bolotnikov, 1606-7, of Sten'ka Razin, 1670-1, of Bulavin, 
1707-8, and of Pugachev, 1773-4. Equally, the civil war in Soviet Russia, 
1917-21 1 contained a major element of peasant unrest. 

Emelyan Ivanovich Pugachev (1726-75) was a small Cossack landowner 
and veteran officer. He had spent years wandering among the monasteries of 
the Old Believers, storing up his sense of resentment. In 1773 he raised the 
standard of revolt at Yaitsk on the Ural River, on the very frontier of Europe, 
declaring himself to be the Emperor Peter III and promising the 
emancipation of the serfs. Hundreds of thousands joined his cause 
throughout the Volga provinces. He was acclaimed by peasants, by 
Cossacks, even by the nomadic Bashkirs and Kazakhs. Lacking coordination 
his supporters deteriorated into rampaging bands. 

At first the Empress made light of 'L'affaire du Marquis de Pugachev', 
setting a modest price of 500 roubles on his head. But the price soon rose to 
28,000. At one point, all the Volga forts were in his hands. Pugachev reduced 
Kazan to ashes, slaughtering all resisters. He maintained a satirical court, 
mimicking the entourage of Catherine's murdered husband. The end came 
after two years of mayhem, when Pugachev's main force was cornered at 
Tsaritsyn. Pugachev was brought to Moscow, and quartered. 2 

At any time until the mid-twentieth century the numerical preponderance of 
the peasantry was not reflected in historiography. Peasants only found their 
way into textbooks when their periodic revolts disturbed the political scene. 
Events such as England's Peasants' Revolt of 1381 or Germany's Peasants' 
War in 1524-5, were favoured by Marxist history-writing because they were 
taken to demonstrate the revolutionary potential of the masses. 3 In fact, no 
peasant rising ever succeeded. Peasants have been shown the most 
conservative of social forces, deeply attached to religion, to the land, to the 
family, and to an immemorial way of life. Their periodic fureurs were 



outbursts of desperation. Their revolving cycle of fortune and misfortune 
was far more important to them than any thought of social revolution. 4 

Peasant studies is one of several flourishing new academic fields. It 
offers great opportunity to examine the interrelations of social, economic, 
anthropological, and cultural themes. It was specially suited to comparative 
analysis-both between European regions and between continents. A 
Journal of Peasant Studies (1973- ) grew out of a seminar centred at 
London's School of Oriental and African Studies. Its editorial statement 
stressed the sheer size of the world's peasantry and their problems: 

Of the underprivileged majority of mankind, [the peasants] are the most 
underprivileged ... No social class has a longer history of struggle against 
such conditions ... Hitherto, scholarly periodicals have treated peasants in a 
peripheral way. We offer this journal as one where the peasantry will be 
central... 6 

France, like Russia, has drawn historians to the study of its very substantial 
peasantry. A multivolume Economic and Social History of France was to 
inspire the second generation of the Annales team. The key volume was 
written by Le Roi Ladurie, whose analysis combines the thematic factors of 
territory, demography, and economy with chronological peri-odization over 
four centuries. The 'Rural Renaissance' of the late fifteenth century followed 
the earlier 'Destruction of the Full World' and preceded the 'Trauma of Civil 
Wars' and the 'Drift, Reconstruction and Crisis' of a seventeenth-century 
Ecosystem which would survive the Revolution.- 

Numerous studies have been made of revolts in the French countryside- 
the 'tithe strikes' of the sixteenth century, the revolt of the Pitauts against the 
salt-tax in Guyenne (1548), the Croquants and Nouveaux Croquants in the 
Limousin-Perigord (1594, 1636-7),- the Gautiers and Nu-pieds in 
Normandy (1594,1639), the 'Enigma of the Rural Fronde' (1648-9), and the 
repeated insurrections in Provence (1596-1715). Attempts have been made 
to link the rhythms of peasant unrest in France to those in Russia, and even 
China.- 

The historian of insurrections in Provence demonstrates that peasant 
revolts were interlaced with other forms of social unrest. He proposes a 
typology of five categories of revolt: 




1. factional struggles within the nobility or 
bourgeoisie, 


2. struggles between the menu peuple and the well-to- 
do, 

3. popular action by the peasants against one of the 
political factions, 

4. struggles between different peasant action groups, 

5. united struggle of the whole community against 
outside agencies. 2 

Anthropological studies are specially fruitful. They reveal the universal, 
immemorial qualities of peasant life. Sicilian reapers sing as peasants sang 
for centuries from Galway to Galicia: 

Fly, fly sharp sickle 
The countryside is all full, 

All full with goods 

For the joy of the landlords [bis] 

How sweet is the good life! 

Tutrutrii, Tutrutrii, 

The pig was four scudi [bis] 

Rich and poor, we are all cuckolds.- 


European literature entered the phase when the vernacular languages took an 
irreversible lead over Latin. Drama, in the hands of the French court playwrights 
-Pierre Corneille (1606-84), Jean-Baptiste Poquelin (Moliere, 1622-73) and 
Jean Racine (1639-99)-adopted forms of language and structure that served as 
the international model for the next century. The tradition of social and 





moralizing comedy was extended in England by the Restoration comedians and 
by Richard Brinsley Sheridan (1751-1816); in France by Pierre Augustin 
Beaumarchais (1732-99); in Italy by Carlo Goldoni (1707-93). 

Poetry was particularly susceptible to the drive for rigorous style and form. 
In English it is dominated by the triad of John Milton (1608-74), John Dryden 
(1631-1700), and Alexander Pope (1688-1744). Pope's intellectual discourses, 
written in the heroic couplets of the Essay on Criticism (1711) and the Essay on 
Man (1733), are infinitely expressive of his generation's temper and interests: 

True ease in writing comes from art, not chance, 

As those move easiest who have learned to dance. 

'Tis not enough no harshness gives offence, 

The sound must seem an echo of the sense. 

All nature is but art, unknown to Thee; 

All chance, direction which thou canst not see; 

All discord, harmony not understood; 

All partial evil, universal good. 

And, spite of pride, in erring reason's spite, 

One truth is clear, Whatever is, is right. 2 

Later, lyrical poetry reasserted itself to redress the balance-in the Scots poems 
of Robert Burns (1759-96), the German of Christian von Kleist (1715-59), F. G. 
Klopstock (1724-1803), and the young Goethe, and the French of Jean Roucher 
(1745-94) and Andre Chenier (1762-94). Prose-writing, though heavily 
dependent on the non-fictional genres, witnessed the growth of true fiction. 
Here, the pioneers appeared in England. Apart from Robinson Crusoe, the 
leading titles included Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels (1726), Samuel 
Richardson's Pamela (1740), Henry Fielding's Tom Jones (1749), and Laurence 
Sterne's Tristram Shandy (1767). In France, both Voltaire and Rousseau, among 
their other talents, were accomplished novelists (see below). 

Although French, English, and German authors predominated, the reading 
public was by no means confined to their countries of origin. Almost all 
educated people in Europe read French at this time; and local translations of 
important titles were widespread. In Poland, for example, which many might 
mistake for a cultural backwater, the catalogue of translations into Polish 
included Robinson Krusoe (1769), Manon Lesko (1769), Kandyd (1780), 



Gulliwer (1784), Awantury Amelii (1788), Historia Tom-Dzona (1793). Some 
Polish authors, such as Jan Potocki (1761-1825), the orientalist, wrote in French 
for both a local and an international readership. 

European musicians, from J. S. Bach (1685-1750) to W. A. Mozart (1756- 
91) and Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827), consolidated the foundations of 
the classical repertoire. They worked in each of its main divisions: instrumental, 
chamber, orchestral, and choral; and they developed a style, which, though often 
confused with the preceding Baroque, was marked by a very particular rhythmic 
energy that has given it lasting appeal, [sonata] They also preserved a balance 
between the sacred and the profane. This may be illustrated from Bach's 
cantatas, Mozart's Requiem (1791) and Beethoven's Missa solemnis (1823), and 
from Bach's concertos, Mozart's forty-one and Beethoven's nine symphonies. 
Austro-German composers enjoyed a growing preponderance. In addition to 
Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven, their first rank included Johann Pachelbel (1653- 
1706), G. P. Telemann (1681-1767), G. F. Handel (1685-1759), and Josef 
Haydn (1732-1809). Yet music remained essentially international in character. 
In their day, the Italians J.-B. Lully (1632-87), Arcangelo Corelli (1653-1713), 
Alessandro Scarlatti (1660-1725), Tomaso Albinoni (1671-1751), and Antonio 
Vivaldi (1675-1741) were just as influential as the Germans. So, too, were the 
Dane Dietrich Buxtehude (1637-1707), the Frenchmen Francois Couperin 
(1668-1733) and J.-P. Rameau (1683-1764), or the organist of Westminster 
Abbey, Henry Purcell (c. 1659-95), in London. The violin, the prime instrument 
of European music, was perfected by Antonio Stradivari (1644-1737) of 
Cremona. The pianoforte was invented in 1709 by B. Cristofori of Padua. Opera 
developed from the early stage of dialogue-with-music to the full-scale musical 
dramas of W. C. Gluck (1714-87). [cantata] [mousike] [opera] [strad] 

Formal religion stayed set in the earlier mould. The religious map of Europe 
did not change significantly. Established Churches continued to operate 
according to rigorous state laws of toleration and non-toleration. Members of the 
official religion gained preferment, having sworn oaths and passed strict tests of 
conformity, non-members and non-jurors, when not actively persecuted, lingered 
in legal limbo. In Catholic countries, Protestants were generally deprived of civil 
rights. In Protestant countries, Catholics suffered the same fate. In Great Britain, 
the Church of England and the Church of Scotland formally barred both Roman 
Catholics and their respective Protestant dissenters. In Sweden, Denmark and 
Holland similar proscriptions applied. In Russia, the Russian Orthodox Church 
enjoyed sole recognition; there were no Jews legally resident. In Poland- 



Lithuania, where the greatest degree of religious heterodoxy persisted, 
restrictions none the less increased. The Socinians were expelled in 1658 for 
alleged collaboration with the Swedes. In 1718 all non-Catholics were barred 
from the Diet. In 1764 the Jews lost their Parliament, but not their kahals or 
local communes. Russian propaganda began to bemoan the plight of Poland's 
Orthodox, whose position was considerably easier than that of Catholics in 
Russia. Prussian propaganda inflated the alleged persecution of Lutherans. 


SONATA 

In origin, sonata referred to music that was 'sounded', not 'sung'. But in the 
eighteenth century it was applied to a particular form of composition that 
came to dominate almost all instrumental music. Sonata form occupies a 
central place in the work of the classical composers from Haydn to Mahler. 
It is to be contrasted with the polyphonic style of the preceding era; and it 
embodied the conventions against which later 'modern' styles were to react. 
It has two aspects-the division of compositions into a formal sequence of 
movements and the elaboration of homophonic harmony, [tone] 

Sonata form had no single starting-point. An early manifestation was 
Gabrieli's Sonata pian e forte (1597) for violin, cornett, and six trombones. 
But its codification into four set movements did not occur until the work of 
Arcangelo Corelli (1653-1713) of Bologna. It was developed in the 
keyboard compositions of C. P. E. Bach (1714-88), and was brought to 
perfection by Haydn and Mozart. Its theoretical foundations were 
foreshadowed in J.-P. Rameau's Traite d'harmonie (1722), but were not fully 
expounded until Carl Czerny's School of Practical Composition (1848), 
twenty years after the death of its greatest exponent-Beethoven. 

Conventional sonata form divides the musical work into four contrasting 
movements. The opening Allegro, in fast tempo, has parallels with the 
operatic overture. The slow second movement grew out of the Baroque aria 
da capo. The third movement, usually minuet and trio, was based on the 
dance suite. The finale returns to a key and tempo reminiscent of the 
opening. Each of the four movements follows a standard pattern consisting 
of the exposition of melodic subjects, their harmonic development, and, at 




the end, their recapitulation, sometimes with a related coda or 
'afterthought'. 

Homophony is the opposite of polyphony. It is characterized by music 
based, like hymn tunes, on a progression of chords, whose constituent notes 
do not possess either melodic or rhythmic independence. Classical harmony, 
therefore, is the opposite of polyphonic counterpoint. The scene of J. S. Bach 
composing his 'Art of Fugue ' (1750) in an empty church in Leipzig 
symbolizes the passing of the polyphonic era. The scene of Beethoven, 
weary but sublimated, struggling to complete his five last quartets, may be 
taken as the summit of homophony. 

Beethoven considered his Quartet in C sharp minor, Opus 131 (1826), to 
be his finest work. In it, he expounds each of the elements from which 
sonata form had grown-an opening fugue; a single-theme scherzo; a central 
aria with variations; and a 'sonata within a sonata' on the inverted fugue. It 
has been called 'a cycle of human experience', and 'a microcosm of 
European music'. 1 

In that span from 1750 to 1827, Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven 
composed between them over 150 symphonies, over 100 piano sonatas, over 
50 string quartets, and numerous concertos-all in sonata form. These works 
form the core of the classical repertoire. 


STRAD 

Lemessie, 'The Messiah', bears the most prestigious of all labels: Antonius 
Stradivarius Cremonensis Faciebat Anno 1716. It was one of ten violins still 
in the workshop of Antonio Stradivari (c.1644-1737) almost forty years 
after his death, and was sold by his sons to Count Cozio di Salabue in 1775. 
Apart from a dozen years in the possession of the French music teacher 
Delphin Alard (1815-88), 'II Salabue' belonged exclusively to dealers- 
Tarisio, Vuillaume, and W. E. Hills. Tarisio was always promising to show it 
to his friends, but never actually did so. 'It's like the Messiah,' one of them 
said; 'always promised, never produced.' 1 

The instrument, rarely played, sits in virtually mint condition in its 




humidified case in Oxford's Ashmolean Museum. It is nothing remarkable to 
look at. Unlike the 'Long Strads' of earlier date, it has the standard body 
length of 356 mm. It has a straight-grained belly, angular corners, plain 
purfling, slanting f-holes, and a two-panelled back in flamed walnut. Its 
pedigree is only revealed by the orange-brown glow of Stradivari's unique 
varnish. Joachim, who played it once, said that it 'combined sweetness and 
grandeur'. 2 The key to a string instrument's tonal quality was often thought 
to lie in its varnish. Too hard a varnish produces an ugly metallic sound; too 
soft a varnish dampens the resonance. Stradivari, a master in all departments 
of his trade, found a varnish whose great elasticity was also durable. His 
reputation is unequalled. 

The violin emerged in late Renaissance Italy. It was descended from the 
family of six-stringed viols, and more particularly from the rebec and the 
lira da braccio. It was extremely versatile. Its fine melodic quality suited it 
for solo purposes, whilst it was the natural leader of the string group of 
violin, viola, cello, and double bass. As the common 'fiddle', it was easily 
adopted for dance music. Small, portable, and relatively inexpensive, it soon 
became the universal workhorse both of Europe's popular and of its 
'classical' music. With the exception of Jacob Stainer (1617-78) in Tyrol, all 
the master violin-makers, from Maggini of Brescia to Amati and Stradivari 
of Cremona and Guarneri of Venice, were Italian. 

The art of violin-playing was greatly advanced by the development of 
systematic teaching methods, including those of Leopold Mozart and of G. 
B. Viotti. The Paris Conservatoire, from 1795, was the predecessor of 
similar institutions in Prague (1811), Brussels (1813), Vienna (1817), 
Warsaw (1822), London (1822), St Petersburg (1862), and Berlin (1869). 

A striking feature of violin-playing from the mid-nineteenth to the mid¬ 
twentieth centuries was the marked predominance of East Europeans. The 
phenomenon may possibly reflect the traditions of fiddle-playing among 
Jews and gypsies, and more probably the special status of music-making in 
politically repressed cultures. At all events, Niccolo Paganini (1782-1840) 
was for a long time the first and last of the 'greats' who was not either East 
European or Jewish or both. Joseph Joachim (1831-1907) of Vienna and 
Henryk Wieniawski (1835-80), a Pole from Lublin who helped launch the St 
Petersburg school, were founders of the magnificent line which ran through 



Kreisler, Ysaye, and Szigeti to Heifitz, Milstein, Oistrakh, Szeryng, and 
Isaac Stern. All played their 'Strads'. The 'Messiah' is one of the very few 
Stradivaris which, sadly, was destined to be seen but not heard. Modern 
craftsmen pay special attention to the choice of timber, variations in 
thickness and curvature, and effect of ageing. 


The Roman Catholic Church settled into a routine that no longer sought to 
recover the Protestant lands. Much of its energies were directed abroad, 
especially to the Jesuit missions in South America, South India, Japan to 1715, 
China, and North America. The chain of twenty-one beautiful Franciscan 
missions in California, which were started by Fr. Junipero Serra (1713-84) and 
which ran from San Diego to San Francisco, have remained a spiritual solace in 
the surrounding wilderness to this day. In Europe the Vatican could not cope 
with the growing centrifugal tendencies of the Church provinces. One Pope, 
Innocent XI (1676-89), was driven in 1688 to excommunicate Louis XIV in 
secret for occupying Avignon in the regalia dispute. Another, Clement IX 
(1700-21), was pushed against his better judgement to issue the Bull Unigenitus 
Dei filius (1713) condemning Jansenism. The Bull, which was specifically 
directed against the Reflexions morales of Pasquier Quesnel, an Oratorian 
sympathetic to the Jan-senists, caused a storm of protest dividing French opinion 
for decades. In the Netherlands in 1724 it led to schism within the Catholic ranks 
and the creation by the Archbishop of Utrecht of the Old Catholic Church of 
Holland. In Germany a movement started in 1763 by a tract of J. N. von 
Hontheim (Febronius) aimed to reconcile Catholics and Protestants by radically 
curtailing the centralizing powers of Rome. In Poland the Vatican lost effective 
control through political domination of the Church hierarchy by Russia. 

In all these disputes the Jesuits, who showed themselves more papist than the 
Popes, became a growing embarrassment. Benedict XTV (1740-58), whose 
moderation won him the unusual accolade of praise from Voltaire, initiated an 
inquiry into their affairs. They were accused of running large-scale money¬ 
making operations, also of adopting native cults to win converts at any price. In 
1759 they were banished from Portugal, in 1764 from France, and in 1767 from 
Spain and Naples. Clement XIII (1758-69) stood by the Society with the words 
Sint ut sunt, aut non sint (may they be as they are, or cease to be). But Clement 
XIV (1769-74), who was elected under the shadow of a formal demand by the 




Catholic powers for abolition, finally acquiesced. The brief Dominus ac 
Redemptor noster of 16 August 1773 abolished the Society of Jesus, on the 
grounds that it was no longer pursuing its founder's objectives. It took effect in 
all European countries except for the Russian Empire. It threw Catholic 
educational and missionary activities into chaos, opening major opportunities 
especially for secular schools and universities. 

The horror of the age occurred in 1685, when Louis XIV revoked the Edict 
of Nantes and all of France's Huguenots were driven into exile (see below). But 
in general the pace of persecution was slackening. In many countries the laws of 
non-toleration were observed in the breach. Wherever nonconformists had 
survived, they now came into the open. In England a new label was coined- 
Latitudinarianism-to describe the strong body of opinion which favoured 
toleration for all Protestants. The Congregationalists or 'Independents' surfaced 
in 1662, initially on condition that their chapels were located at least five miles 
from any parish church. Following the remarkable career of George Fox (1624- 
91), the Society of Friends or 'Quakers' suffered numerous martyrdoms until 
gaining the right to worship, like other dissenters, from the Toleration Act of 
1689. The General Body of Dissenters-Independents, Presbyterians, and 
Baptists-was organized in London in 1727. The Moravian Church re-emerged 
in Holland, in England, and in the experimental community of Herrnhut (1722) 
in Saxony. Eighteenth-century manners, as opposed to many eighteenth-century 
laws, favoured toleration. The climate was right for deists, for dissenters, even 
for religious jokers. 'They say', wrote Voltaire, 'that God is always on the side of 
the big battalions.' [mason] 

Various religious counter-currents appeared, in reaction to the growing 
inertia of the established Churches. In the Catholic world the Quietism of Miguel 
de Molinos (c. 1640-97) caused real disquiet. Its founder, who taught that sin can 
only be avoided in a state of complete spiritual passivity, died in prison in Rome; 
and his book, the Spiritual Guide (1675), was condemned by the Jesuits as 
heretical. In the Lutheran world, the Pietism of P. J. Spener (1635-1705) caused 
similar ructions. Its founder, who proclaimed the universal priesthood of the 
faithful, instituted the practice of devotional circles for Bible-reading; and his 
book, Pia Desideria (1675), became the keystone of a long-lasting movement. 
The University of Halle was its centre. 

In the Anglican world, the Methodism of John Wesley (1703-91) threatened 
to tear the Church of England apart. Wesley had created a spiritual Method for 



his 'Holy Club' of students at Oxford, and had visited Herrnhut. His lifetime of 
evangelism, touring the remotest parts of the British Isles, fired the neglected 
masses with enthusiasm. His rejection of episcopacy, however, was bound to 
cause a schism, and the first Methodist Conference assembled in London in 
1785. His brother Charles Wesley (1707-88) was an Anglican hymn-writer of 
genius, whose magnificent cadences well expressed the changing tone of the 
times. 

Methodism took particularly powerful root in Wales, where it is widely 
believed to have inspired not just a religious but a national revival. 3 The first 
Welsh Methodist Association, which met in January 1743, preceded the first 
equivalent meeting in England. Its Calvinistic theology was to lead in a direction 
more akin to Presbyterianism. At the same time, the Circulating Schools 
organized by the Revd Griffith Jones, Rector of Llanddowror; the magnificent 
Welsh hymns of William Williams (1717-91), 'Williams Pant y Celyn'; and an 
elevated preaching tradition started by Daniel Rowland (1713-90) of Llangeitho, 
the 'Jerusalem of Wales', forged the instruments which would ensure the 
survival of Welsh language and culture into modern times. No one who has 
heard a Welsh choir soaring in full harmony to the strains of Llanfair, Cwm 
Rhondda, or Blaenwern can fail to appreciate what national pride and spiritual 
uplift mean. Needless to say, the hwyl or fervour of the Welsh Methodists was 
diametrically opposed to the temper of the Enlightenment, which by then was 
the dominant trend in the leading intellectual circles of Europe. 

In the Jewish world, the Hasidism of Baal Shem Tov (1700-60), the Besht of 
Miedzyboz in Podolia, undermined the Polish rabbis much as Wesley was 
undermining the Anglican bishops. The Hasidim or 'Pious Ones' rejected the 
desiccated formalism of the synagogues, and set themselves apart in clannish 
communities ruled by hereditary zaddiks or 'holy men'. They were very distant 
in space and culture from Christian Methodism, but were close in temper. They 
rigorously adhered to orthodox Judaic laws of dress and diet, but, once again, the 
movement was marked by the fervour of the masses, by joyful music, by the 
revival of spirituality. 

Equally prominent was a decided shift in Europe's social manners. People 
reacted against the strictures of the preceding age not so much by changing the 
laws as by ignoring the norms of taste and conduct which the religious 
authorities had once been able to impose. In sharp contrast to the Calvinist and 
Jesuit puritanism which still predominated c.1660, the following century saw 



both a sharp rise in artistic sensitivity and a sharp decline in moral restraints. The 
'Age of Elegance 5 went hand in hand with an age of easy scruples. On the one 
hand the upper classes and their imitators took to the arts of graceful living as 
never before: luxury and refinement were seen everywhere in their dress, their 
palaces, their furniture, their music, their collections. At the same time, in all 
classes, there was a marked relaxation of social, and especially sexual, mores. 
With time, sexual licence became not just tolerated but ostentatious. After the 
long interval of the Reformations, everyone was free, if they wanted, to behave 
once again with abandon. For those whose health and pockets could afford it, 
excess in dressing, carousing, gourmandizing, and philandering was routine. 
People took pride in the perruque and the puffed petticoat, in the landscaped 
park, in painted porcelain and the powdered pudendum. This was the social 
climate which no doubt helped promote the religious revivals. But it also 
enlarged the margin of intellectual tolerance which the philosophes Of the 
Enlightenment were able to exploit, [eros] 


EROS 

It has been stated that 'he left no stern unturned 5 . Friedrich Augustus, 
Elector of Saxony and King of Poland, is said to be the father of some 300 
children, including Maurice de Saxe, Marshal of France (1696-1750). His 
wonderful amours attested both to his catholic taste and his phenomenal 
stamina. 1 Apart from his wife, Eberdine of Bayreuth, he cultivated the 
favours of a covey of concubines-official, confidential, and top-secret. 
Maurice de Saxe was the son of the Swedish Countess Aurora of 
Konigsmarck; his half-brother, Count Rotowski, was the child of Fatima, a 
Turkish girl captured at Buda; his half-sister, Countess Orzelska, of 
Henriette Duval, daughter of a Warsaw wine-merchant. On the official list, 
the Countess d'Esterle was followed by Mme Teschen, Mme Hoym, Mme 
Cosel, Maria, Countess Denhoff, but not, exceptionally, by the ex-mistress of 
the British ambassador in Dresden. Friedrich Augustus would have been a 
great king if only his political ventures had been half as well-aimed as his 
spermatozoa. 2 (Spoil-sports estimate his progeny at eight.) 3 





The Enlightenment, according to Kant, was the period in the development of 
European civilization when 'Mankind grew out of its self-inflicted immaturity'. 
More simply, one might say that Europeans reached 'the age of discretion'. The 
metaphor is a powerful one, with medieval Christendom seen as the parent and 
Europe's secular culture as a growing child conceived in the Renaissance. 
Childhood had been encumbered by the baggage of parental and religious 
tradition and by family quarrels. The key attainment came with 'the autonomy of 
reason', the ability to think and act for oneself. But the child continued to 
possess a number of strong family traits. 

Perhaps the Enlightenment is best understood, however, by reference to the 
darkness which this 'light of reason' was trying to illuminate. The darkness was 
provided, not by religion as such, which was taken by the philosophes to be 
filling a basic human need, but by all the unthinking, irrational, dogmatic 
attitudes with which European Christianity had become encrusted. These 
attitudes, including bigotry, intolerance, superstition, monkishness, and 
fanaticism, were summed up in the most pejorative word of the age, 
'enthusiasm'. The Lumieres, as the French called the movement, were to be 
beamed on to a wide range of subjects: philosophy, science and natural religion, 
economics, politics, history, and education. 

The particular intellectual habitat which fostered the growth of rationalism 
was not to be found everywhere. It required on the one hand the presence of both 
Catholics and Protestants, whose rival dogmas set up a suitable clash of ideas, 
and on the other hand a measure of toleration within which a rational dialogue 
could be started. In the seventeenth century it was only found in three or four 
locations. Such conditions existed in Poland-Lithuania-where Jesuits mingled 
with Orthodox, Jews, and a number of radical sects. They existed to some extent 
in Switzerland, where an interchange of ideas was always possible between the 
Catholic and Protestant cantons. They existed in Scotland, and in England, 
where the broad Anglican tradition protected contrary points of view. But they 
existed above all in the Netherlands, where the native resources were 
supplemented by a long line of intellectual refugees, from J. J. Scaliger and Rene 
Descartes to Spinoza, Shaftesbury, Le Clerc, and Bayle. Leyden, the 'Athens of 
Batavia', Amsterdam, the 'Cosmopolis' of Europe, and The Hague were the 
main laboratories of the Enlightenment. Although Frenchmen were prominent 
from the start, and French was adopted as the lingua franca, France itself did not 
become the principal scene of activity until the mid-eighteenth century, when 
local conditions relaxed. Voltaire, one of the central figures, was forced to settle 



in Switzerland, or on the Swiss border. 

The key concept-the lumen naturale or 'natural light of reason'-has been 
traced to one of Melanchthon's works, De lege naturae (1559), and via 
Melanchthon to Cicero and the Stoic philosophers. For this reason the translation 
of the text of the Stoics by Joost Lips (Lipsius, 1547-1606) at Leyden is seen as 
a landmark. Together with the fruits of the Scientific Revolution and the rational 
method of Descartes, it formed the core of an ideology which held centre-stage 
from the 1670s to the 1770s. It led to the conviction that reason could uncover 
the rules that underlay the apparent chaos of both the human and material world, 
and hence of natural religion, of natural morality, of natural law. In the arts, too, 
it led to the notion that strict rules and symmetrical patterns could alone give 
expression to the natural order with which all Beauty should be associated. 
Beauty was order; and order was beautiful. Here was the true spirit of 
Classicism. 

The philosophy of the Enlightenment was primarily concerned with 
epistemology, that is, the theory of knowledge-or how we know what we know. 
Here, the basis for debate was supplied by three Britons: the Englishman John 
Locke (1632-1704), the Irishman Bishop George Berkeley (1685-1753), and the 
Scotsman David Hume (1711-76), sometime secretary of the British Embassy in 
Paris. As empiricists, they all accepted that the scientific method of observation 
and deduction should be applied to human affairs, and hence the precept of their 
contemporary, Alexander Pope: 

Know then thyself, presume not God to scan, 

The proper study of mankind is Man. 4 

Locke's famous Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690) advanced 
the proposition that the human mind is blank at birth-a tabula rasa. All we 
know, therefore, is the fruit of experience, either through the senses, which 
process data from the external world, or through the faculty of reflection, which 
processes data from the mind's internal workings. Locke's proposition was 
developed in France by the Abbe Condillac (1715-80), whose Traite des 
Sensations (1754) used the analogy of an inanimate statue brought to life by the 
acquisition of its senses, and by Julien Offray de la Mettrie (1709-51), whose 
thoroughgoing materialism in L'Homme machine (1748) denied the existence of 
the spiritual altogether. Bishop Berkeley went to the other extreme, arguing that 
only minds and mental events can exist. Hume, whose Treatise of Human Nature 
(1739-40) pursues a rational inquiry into understanding, passions, and morals, 



ends up by denying the possibility of rational belief. Eighteenth-century 
rationalism concluded after all that irrationality may not be entirely 
unreasonable. 

In the realm of moral philosophy, several strands of religious and intellectual 
thought led towards the ultimate destination of utilitarianism. Rationalists tended 
to judge moral principles by their utility in improving man's condition. The 
tendency is already present in Locke. Baron d'Holbach (1723-89), in some ways 
the most radical of the philosophes, advocated a hedonistic morality where virtue 
is that which causes the greatest pleasure. Later, happiness was viewed more as a 
communal than as an individual virtue. Social harmony became the goal, not just 
private well-being. In 1776 a young Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) formulated 
the guiding principle: 'It is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is 
the measure of right and wrong.' 

The Enlightenment was not sympathetic to European Jewry. The Jews were 
regarded as a religious community, and their religion as unreasonable and 
obscurantist. Dryden, for one, did not spare the sarcasm: 

The Jews, a headstrong, moody, murmuring race, 

God's pampered people, whom, debauched with ease, 

No King could govern, nor no god could please.' 5 

In time, certain Jewish leaders grew similarly critical of themselves. They 
longed to escape from the constrictions of traditional Judaism. The end result 
was the Jewish Enlightenment, the Haskalah, which sought to reform the Jewish 
community from within (see p. 843). 

Scientific knowledge, in the meantime, made great strides. The central giant 
of the period was Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727), President of the Royal Society, 
who published his Principia in 1687. His Laws of Motion and Gravity provided 
the basis of physics, and hence of the working of the universe, for over 200 
years. He invented differential calculus, which he called 'fluxions'. 
Appropriately enough for a father of the Enlightenment, he had conducted his 
first experiments in 1666 into the nature of Light, placing a glass prism behind a 
hole in the blind of his window in Trinity College, Cambridge: 

'And I saw... that the light, tending to [one] end of the Image, did suver a Refraction considerably greater 
than the light tending to the other. And so the true cause of the length of that Image was detected to be no 
other, than that Light consists of Rays differently refrangible which... were, according to their degrees of 
refrangibility, transmitted towards divers parts of the wall .' 6 



It was a nice irony that the properties of light eventually gave Einstein the clues 
which eventually overthrew .the Newtonian system, [e = me 2 ] Newton, as a 
Unitarian, was debarred from many formal honours, but he did not miss out on 
fame and fortune. He even dabbled in alchemy. He described himself charmingly 
as 'a boy playing on the sea-shore ... while the great ocean of truth lay all 
undiscovered before me'. 7 Pope wrote an epitaph intended for Newton's tomb in 
Westminster Abbey: 

Nature and Nature's laws lay hid in night; 

God said, Let Newton be! and all was light. 

The exploitation of Newton's principles was assisted both by improvements 
in technology and by parallel advances in other sciences. The Royal Observatory 
(1675) at Greenwich developed superior telescopes; the British Admiralty, by 
offering a prize of £20,000, was given the chronometer. In mathematics the 
Leipziger Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716) may well have discovered calculus 
independently before Newton did. In biology and, more specifically, in botany, 
the Swede Carl von Linne (Linnaeus, 1707-78), brought order from chaos in his 
system for classifying plants expounded in the Systema naturae (1735) and 
Fundamenta botanica (1736). In chemistry, fundamental steps were taken by 
Joseph Priestley (1733-1804), who explored the compound nature of air, by 
Henry Cavendish (1731-1810), who demonstrated the compound nature of 
water, and above all by Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier (1743-94), who finally 
discovered the workings of chemical reactions, [eldluft] [euler] 

The interest in the theory of knowledge, when added to the growing corpus 
of information, had a natural corollary in a mania for encyclopedias. Compendia 
of universal knowledge had been common enough in the Middle Ages; but they 
had fallen out of fashion. Early attempts to revive the genre included those of J. 
H. Alsted, published in Holland in 1630, and of Louis Moreri, published at 
Lyons in 1674. The father of the modern medium, however, is generally taken to 
be Pierre Bayle (1647-1706). The first folio of his Dictionnaire historique et 
critique appeared in Rotterdam in 1697. In England the genre was represented 
by the Lexicon technicum (1704) of John Harris LRS, and by the Cyclopaedia 
(1728) of Ephraim Chambers; in Germany by J. Hiibner's Reales Staats 
Zeitungs- und Conversations- Lexicon (Leipzig, 1704) and by J. T. Jablonski's 
Allgemeines Lexicon (Leipzig, 1721); in Italy by G. Pivati's Dizionario 
universale (Venice, 1744); and in Poland by B. Chmielowski's NoweAteny 
(1745-6). Avast illustrated Universal Lexicon in 64 volumes and 4 supplements 



was published in Leipzig by J. H. Zedler between 1732 and 1754. In France, the 
great project of the Encyclopedic or Dictionnaire raisonne des arts, des sciences, 
et des metiers, undertaken by Denis Diderot (1713-84) and Jean d'Alembert 
(1717-83), was originally inspired by a French translation of Chambers. It 
appeared in Paris in 17 volumes of 16,288 pages between 1751 and 1765, with 
further supplements, illustrations, and indexes appearing up to 1782. It was 
programmatic, opinionated, anticlerical, and highly critical of the regime; and its 
editors were regularly harassed by officialdom. Yet it was a monument to the 
age. It aimed at nothing less than a summary of the whole of human knowledge. 
The first edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, less distinguished but longer- 
lived, appeared in Edinburgh in 1768. In the meantime, Hiibner's Lexicon had 
mn into many editions and translations. Its copyright would eventually be 
bought in 1808 by the publisher F. A. Brockhaus (1772-1823), who used it as 
the basis for the most celebrated of all German encyclopedias. 


EULER 

In 1765 the Russian ambassador at Berlin was authorized to invite a one- 
eyed man to St Petersburg and not to spare the cost. Leonhard Euler (1707- 
83) accepted on condition that he receive the directorship of the Russian 
Imperial Academy, a vast salary of 3,000 roubles, a pension for his wife, and 
high appointments for his four sons. His conditions were met without demur. 
Five years earlier, when the Russian army had vandalized his farm at 
Charlottenburg, the Tsar had compensated him richly. For Euler was the 
supreme mathematical wizard of the age. By common accord, his only peer 
in the history of mathematics was C. F. Gauss (1777-1855), who was born in 
Brunswick ten years after Euler left Berlin. 

It was said that 'Euler calculated as other men breathe, or eagles soar'. 
Son of a Swiss pastor and educated at Basle, he possessed a phenomenal 
memory. He could recite the whole of Virgil's Aeneid including the numbers 
of the lines and pages. He first went to Russia as a young man in the 
company of the Bernouilli brothers, before being 'head-hunted' by the agents 
of Frederick the Great. His output was as prolific as it was original. He wrote 
886 scientific works and c.4,000 letters, at an average rate of two printed 




pages per day over five decades. The Russian journal Commentarii 
Academiae Scientiarum Imperialis Petropolitanae was still publishing the 
backlog of his articles forty-five years after his death. He discovered any 
number of theorems, invented the calculation of sines, completed the search 
for the numerical evaluation of pi, and posited the existence of 
transcendental numbers. 'Euler's Theorem' demonstrated the connection 
between exponential and trigonometric functions: 

e lx = cosx +/ sinx 

Euler's prestige brought the Russian Academy into the mainstream of 
European science. The brilliant school of mathematics at St Petersburg long 
outlasted him. But he was reluctant to talk about it. When pressed on the 
matter at Potsdam by Frederick the Great's mother, he replied, 'Madam, in 
that country they hang those who talk.' 1 Such however was Euler's authority 
that the symbols employed in his textbook Introductio in analysis 
infinitorum (1748) were to provide the basis for standard mathematical 
notation. He was instrumental in promoting for mathematicians a universal 
medium of communication of a type which, for the purpose of everyday life, 
Europeans never developed. (See Appendix III, p. 1243.) 


Religious thought was profoundly influenced by rationalism-especially in the 
sphere of biblical scholarship. The initial problem was how to distinguish 
between the rival claims of Catholics and Protestants, both of whom gave 
scriptural backing to their dogmas. An early start had been made in The Religion 
of Protestants (1637) by William Chillingworth, an Oxford Fellow who had 
studied with the Jesuits at Douai and who, typically, was falsely accused of being 
a Socinian. The biggest advance was made by the French Oratorian Richard 
Simon (1638-1712), who applied the classical rules of French literary criticism 
to his Histoire critique du Vieux Testament (1678). Simon's book was attacked 
by Bossuet and placed on the Index, and all copies of the first edition destroyed. 
But the method survived. 

In due course, reasoning about religion gave rise to an intellectual fashion for 
Deism. This was religious belief reduced to its minimal core: belief in a 
'Supreme Being', in God the Creator, or in Providence. Its early manifestations 




surfaced in England in various shaky credos, notably the De Veritate (Paris, 
1624) of Lord Herbert of Cherbury (1583-1648) and J. J. Toland's Christianity 
Not Mysterious (1696). It reached its peak in the 1730s, when Voltaire was in 
England, but was much diminished after the publication of The Analogy of 
Religion (1736) by Bishop Joseph Butler-of whose lasting influence Queen 
Caroline was once told: 'No Madam, he is not dead, but he is buried.' Deistic 
positions were reached in France in attempts to find the middle ground between 
traditional Christianity and the more extreme free-thinkers, such as Baron 
d'Holbach (1723-89) and Claude Helvetius (1715-71), who had begun to 
express openly Atheist opinions. Diderot, for example, writing the entries for his 
Encyclopedie on 'Christianity', 'Faith', and 'Providence', took a Deist stance. 
Voltaire, whose attacks on established religion were unrelenting, none the less 
sprang to defend the existence of God against the attacks of d'Holbach's Systeme 
de la nature (1770). Reflecting on the sky at night, he wrote: 'One would have to 
be blind not to be dazzled by this sight; one would have to be stupid not to 
recognise its author; one would have to be mad not to worship him.' 'Si Dieu 
n'existait pas,' he quipped, 'il faudrait l'inventer.' 8 (If God did not exist, He 
would have to be invented.) 

The struggle of the philosophes against the authorities of Church and State 
inevitably created the impression that Catholicism and absolute monarchy were 
united in their blind opposition to all reason and change. Diderot has been 
credited with the uncharitable comment about Salvation arriving when 'the last 
King was strangled with the entrails of the last priest'. He was only one step 
away from the simplified revolutionary vision of the universal war between 
progress and reaction. In due course the Catholic publicist Joseph de Maistre 
(1754-1821) accepted the same extreme position but from the opposite point of 
view, maintaining in his Considerations sur la France (1796) that rebellion and 
impiety are synonymous. 

Rational economics stood high on the Enlightenment's list of priorities. The 
general notion of progress found expression in the particular idea of economic 
improvement. At the micro-level, gentlemen were absorbed by the rising science 
of estate management, convinced that their properties could not simply be put in 
order but could be transformed into thriving businesses. Land reclamation by the 
Dutch or on the Dutch model changed the face of several low-lying regions, 
from the fenlands of East Anglia to the delta of the Vistula. The enclosure 
movement gained speed, especially in England, threatening the peasantry but 
promising larger agrarian units suitable for commercial cultivation. Systematic 



stock-breeding, plant selection, soil nutrition, crop rotation, and drainage, as 
practised by 'Farmer George' at Windsor in the 1770s or by Thomas Coke of 
Holkham in Norfolk, was rewarded by dramatically improved yields. In those 
countries where serfdom prevailed, some enlightened landowners convinced 
themselves that their serfs would work more efficiently if freed from their 
obligations. Instances of voluntary emancipation can be found from France to 
Poland. 

At the macro-level, mercantilism of the autocratic variety long held sway. Its 
great exponent was Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619-83), minister to Louis XIV. 
State manufactories were started. Colonies were planted, taxation rationalized, 
ports, roads, and canals constructed, transport improved. The great Canal du 
Languedoc (1681) had its counterparts right across Europe, from the canalized 
Guadalquivir in Spain to the Eskilstuna Canal in Sweden, the Augustow Canal in 
Lithuania, and the great Neva-Volga complex in Russia. 

Yet the conviction grew that economic life could not expand beyond a certain 
point unless shorn of artificial curbs and restrictions. This trend found early 
expression in the work of the Irish banker Richard Cantillon (d. 1734), who was 
quoted by Mirabeau senior in the highly popular work L'Ami des hommes 
(1756). But it gained currency with the economists or 'Physiocrats' associated 
with the Encyclopedie -Francois Quesnay (1694-1774), Jean de Gournay 
(1712-59), and J. P. Dupont de Nemours (1739-1817). The celebrated slogan 
'Pauvres paysans, pauvre royaume' encapsulated the revolutionary notion that 
national prosperity could only be assured through the personal prosperity and 
liberty of all. Quesnay's disciple Jacques Turgot (1727-81) failed in the attempt 
to apply the movement's principles to practical government. But the Scots 
professor Adam Smith (1723-90), residing in Paris in 1765-6, made the close 
acquaintance of Quesnay's circle. It was a formative experience for the founder 
of modern economics, [market] 

Rationalist political theory was long associated with support for absolute 
monarchy, which accorded well with the classical spirit of order and harmony. It 
was seeking for the most efficient means of cutting through the maze of local 
and feudal privilege. Hobbes's conclusions, if not his argumentation, were not ah 
that different from those of French divines such as the great J. B. Bossuet, 
Bishop of Meaux (1627-1704), chief advocate of the divine right of kings. In the 
eighteenth century, however, the arguments changed. Locke's two Treatises on 
Government (1690) proposed that government should be subject to natural law, 



and opposed the hereditary principle. He demanded some form of neutral 
authority for settling disputes between ruler and ruled. Most importantly, whilst 
underlining the rights of property, he developed the idea of government through 
a social contract, and hence the principle of consent, the corner-stone of 
liberalism. Though he had little to say about the judiciary, he advocated the 
separation of powers, and the need for checks and balances between the 
executive and the legislative. These two last principles were most clearly 
formulated in L'Esprit des lois (Geneva, 1748) of Charles Louis de Secondat, 
Baron de Montesquieu (1689-1755), who drew his inspiration partly from Greek 
and Roman republicanism and partly from the English constitutional settlement 
of 1689: 

In each state, there are three sorts of powers: the legislative power, the executive power over things 
dependent on the rights of the people, and the executive power relating to the civil law... All would be lost 
if the same man... were to exercise all three of these powers: the power of making laws, the power of 
putting public resolutions into effect, and the power of judging crimes . 9 

The theories of Locke and Montesquieu were widely disseminated by the 
Encyclopedie, especially in entries such as 'Political Authority' and 'Natural 
Liberty'. They encouraged democratic tendencies and, some would say, 
revolution. 

Rationalist history-writing came to the fore. History moved from the mere 
relation of events in chronicles or diaries, and from the advocacy of the ruling 
church or monarch, to become the science of causation and change. Bossuet's 
so-called Histoire universelle (1681) or the Earl of Clarendon's History of the 
Great Rebellion (1704) still belonged to the old tradition, as did numerous 
Catholic and Protestant accounts of the religious wars. But in the eighteenth 
century several people turned their hand to history of the new sort. Bayle's 
Dictionnaire (1702) consisted of alphabetical entries on all the great names of 
history and literature, and examined with implacable scepticism the certainties 
and uncertainties in the received information about each of them. It showed that 
no historical fact could be accepted without evidence. Vico's Scienza nuova 
(1725) introduced the theory of history moving in cycles. Montesquieu's 
Considerations (1734) on the ancient world introduced the idea of environmental 
determinants, whilst Voltaire's studies of Charles XII or of Louis XIV introduced 
the factors of chance and of great personalities. Hume's treatise on The Natural 
History of Religion (1757) broke the sacred sod of religious history. All rejected 
the role of providence as an explanation for past events, and in so doing were 



returning to habits of thought not exercised since Machiavelli and Guicciardini. 
They were all susceptible to the newfangled notion of progress, whose classic 
exposition was made at the Sorbonne by the young Turgot, in a long Latin 
discourse read in two parts on 3 July and 11 December 1750: 


MARKET 

Dr adam smith (1723-90) was the ultimate absent-minded professor. He 
once brewed an infusion of bread and butter and pronounced it a very bad 
cup of tea. He became one of the sights of Edinburgh, where he was given to 
rambling the streets in a trance, half-dressed and twitching all over, heatedly 
debating with himself in a peculiar affected voice and careering along with 
his inimitable 'worm-like' gait. He once walked straight into a tanning pit in 
full discourse. Virtually unmarriageable, he always lived with his mother. It 
is nice to think that this charmingly chaotic character should have set about 
putting intellectual order into the workings of everyday life. 1 

Together with his friend David Hume, Smith was one of the stars of the 
Scottish Enlightenment in an era when English academic life slumbered. He 
was in close touch with Johnson, Voltaire, Franklin, Quesnay, Burke. When 
the elderly professor was received by the King's ministers, they all rose to 
their feet. 'We all stand, Mr Smith,' said William Pitt, 'because we are all 
your scholars.' 

Smith's career started at the age of 28 with the Chair of Moral 
Philosophy at Glasgow, where he published his Theory of Moral Sentiments 
(1759). It was an enquiry into the origins of approval and disapproval. He 
entered the realm of economics by asking himself about the implications of 
human greed, and how self-interest could work for the common good. The 
900 pages of The Wealth of Nations (1776) were essentially an extended 
essay in pursuit of that quest. It shattered the protectionist philosophy of 
mercantilism, which had reigned supreme in economic thought for 200 
years. Smith's speculations led him to postulate the existence of 'society', in 
whose mechanisms all people participate, and to formulate the laws of 'the 
market'. He outlined the workings of production, of competition, of supply 
and demand, and of prices. He paid special attention to the organization of 




labour. This is shown in his famous description of a pin factory. Rationalized 
tasks and specialized skills enabled the workforce to produce 48,000 pins a 
day, where each of the workers might individually produce only two or 
three. He also stressed the self-regulating nature of the market, which, if 
unhindered, would foster social harmony. He identified two basic market 
laws-the Law of Accumulation and the Law of Population. The demand 
for men', he wrote rather shockingly, 'necessarily regulates the production of 
men.' His watchword was: 'Let the Market Alone.' 2 

The science of economics has been exploring the issues raised by Smith ever 
since. The trail leads from Ricardo, Malthus, and Marx, via Hobson, Bastiat, 
and Marshall, to Veblen, Schumpeter, and Keynes. In Smith's hands it was a 
branch of speculative philosophy; and its greatest practitioners have 
recognized the fragility of their conclusions. In the popular mind, however, 
economics has greater pretensions. It has moved into the void left by the 
decline of religion and the moral consensus; and it is increasingly seen as the 
main preoccupation of public policy, a panacea for social ills, the source 
even of private contentment. From being a technical subject, explaining 
human society in the way that medicine explains the human body, it 
threatens to become an end in itself, laying down goals, motives, incentives. 
Smith, the moralist, would have been appalled. 


Nature has given all men the right of being happy... All the generations are linked to one another by a 
series of causes and effects which join the present condition of the world with all those that have preceded 
it... and the whole human species, looked at from its origins, appears to the philosopher as an immense 
whole, which, like an individual, has its infancy and its progress ... The totality of humanity, fluctuating 
between calm and agitation, between good times and bad, moves steadily though slowly towards a greater 
perfection . 10 

Historians increasingly applied the social, economic, and cultural concerns of 
their own day to the analysis of the past. The doings of kings and courts no 
longer sufficed. Two great monuments of the age were William Robertson's 
History of America (1777) and Edward Gibbon's incomparable Decline and Fall 
of the Roman Empire (1788). Only one volume of the History of the Polish 
Nation (1780- ) by Bishop Adam Naruszewicz saw the light of day, since the 
Empress Catherine's ambassador objected to a description of early Slav history 
in which the Poles were more prominent than the Russians. 




On reflection, one has to doubt whether the sages of the Enlightenment were 
any more objective than the court and clerical historians whom they so 
mercilessly ridiculed. Gibbon's attacks on, say, monasticism, or Voltaire's ill- 
informed swipes at Poland, which he used as a whipping-boy to enliven his 
views on religious bigotry, replaced one form of bias by another. But in the 
process both the scope and reputation of historiography was greatly increased. In 
reality, the Enlightenment was full of contradictions. Its leading practitioners 
held a measure of agreement on aims and methods, but reached no consensus of 
views and opinions. The two most influential figures, Voltaire and Rousseau, 
were as different as chalk and cheese. 

Francois-Marie Arouet (1694-1778), who had assumed the pen-name of 
Voltaire during a spell of imprisonment in the Bastille, was poet, dramatist, 
novelist, historian, philosopher, pamphleteer, correspondent of kings, and, above 
all, a militant wit. Born and educated in Paris, he spent much of his long life in 
various sorts of exile. His books, printers, and publishers were repeatedly 
condemned. He hovered on the outer fringes of political and social respectability, 
and eventually settled, symbolically, on the furthest frontier of France at Ferney, 
near Geneva. He left Paris in disgrace at 32 and, apart from three uneasy years as 
historiographer royal at Versailles in 1744-7, he did not return until the age of 
84. He spent six seminal years in England, three at the welcoming court of 
Stanislaw Feszczyriski at Euneville in Eorraine, and three in Prussia with an 
admiring Frederick the Great. He was chased from Switzerland for comments 
about Calvin. At Ferney, 1760-78, where he held court to a constant crush of 
visitors, 'Europe's Inn-keeper' was hailed as 'Fe Roi Voltaire'; and 'le seigneur 
du village' put his theories into practice: draining the marsh, running a model 
farm, building a church, a theatre, a silk factory, and a watch works. The refuge 
of forty savages has been turned into an opulent little town of 1,200 useful 
persons,' he noted with pride. 

Voltaire's published works, which fill over 100 volumes, are addressed to the 
goals of tolerance in religion, peace and liberty in politics, enterprise in 
economics, intellectual leadership in the arts. The Lettres anglaises (1734), 
which talk admiringly about everything from the Quakers, Parliament, and the 
commercial spirit to Bacon, Focke, and Shakespeare, gave new food for thought 
to conventional Catholic circles on the Continent. The Siecle de Louis XIV 
(1751) gave the French a rich but critical view of their recent past. The 
philosophical novel Candide ou Voptimisme (1759) was written in response to 
Rousseau. It tells the story of the eager young Candide and his enlightened tutor, 



Pangloss, whose motto is 'all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds'. 
They set out into the world from the Castle of Thunder-ten-tronckh only to meet 
with every known form of disaster: war, massacre, disease, arrest, torture, 
treachery, earthquake, shipwreck, inquisition, and slavery. In the end they 
conclude, since the evils of the world are overwhelming, that all one can do is to 
put one's own affairs into order. Candide's closing words are 'il faut cultiver 
notre jardin' (we have to cultivate our own garden). The Traite sur la tolerance 
(1763), inspired by the appalling Calas affair in Toulouse, where a Calvinist 
father was broken on the wheel for allegedly opposing his son's conversion to 
Catholicism, was a cry from the heart. The Dictionnaire philosophique 
portatif(i764), a pocket-sized rival to the great Encyclopedie, is a tour de force of 
irony and satire. In addition there are a score of tragedies, a vast collection of 
polemical pamphlets, some 15,000 letters. He died in Paris, having seen his bust 
crowned on the stage of his latest play. 'They would come in the same numbers 
to see my execution,' he said. And he was still writing verse: 

Nous naissons, nous vivons, bergere, 

Nous mourons sans savoir comment; 

Chacun est parti du neant; 

Ou va-t-il?... Dieu le sait, ma chere. 

(We are born, we live, my shepherdess | How or why we die, it isn't clear; | Each 
one took off from nothingness; | Where to?... God knows, my dear.)- 

'I die adoring God,' he proclaimed, 'loving my friends, not hating my enemies, 
but detesting superstition.'- 

Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-78), born in Protestant Geneva, was still more 
of a wanderer than Voltaire. He possessed almost the same range of talents, as 
musician, novelist, and philosopher, and acquired a similarly formidable 
reputation. A runaway boy, who spent almost a decade on the open roads of 
Savoy and Switzerland, he was taken in, at the price of his conversion, by a 
Catholic lady living at Annecy. Largely self-educated, he made his way in the 
world as a tutor, composer, ballet-master, as a valet in Paris, as secretary of the 
French embassy in Venice. His liaison with a simple and uneducated girl, 
Therese Levasseur, and the fate of their five children, who were given in care to 
the Enfants Trouves (Foundlings), was the source of much stress, of intellectual 
speculation, and possibly of his recurrent mental illness. He gained sudden 


celebrity in middle age by winning a prize from the Academy of Dijon for his 
Discours sur les sciences et les arts (1750), and by producing a popular opera, 
Le Devin du village (1752). Befriended by Diderot, he became by turns star and 
victim of the Parisian salons until he took once more to the road. Obsessed with 
a non-existent conspiracy against him, he was driven from refuge to refuge by 
fears of Voltaire's partisans and by his own inner insecurities: to Geneva, to 
Motiers in Prussian Neuchatel, to an island in the Lac de Bienne, to England, to 
Bourgoin and Montquin in Dauphine. His last years in Paris were spent editing 
his memoirs and the Reveries dupromeneur solitaire (1782). He died in the castle 
of Ermenonville. 

Rousseau's contrary character used the methods of the Enlightenment to 
denounce the Enlightenment's achievements. The Discourse which made him 
famous argued that civilization was corrupting human nature. His second 
Discours sur Vinegalite (1755) painted an idyllic vision of primitive man and 
blamed prosperity for all the ills of political and social relations. It united both 
the radicals and the conservatives against him. The novel Julie ou la nouvelle 
Heloise (1761), a love story set amid Rousseau's native Alps, forged an 
unprecedented link between passion, moral sentiment, and untamed nature. 
Emile ou /'education (1762), another prodigious success, outlines the upbringing 
of a child who is to avoid the artificial decadence of civilization. This child of 
nature was to learn from God-given experience, not from man-made books; to be 
happy, he must be skilled and free. 

Du contrat social (1762) was truly revolutionary. Its opening sentence railed 
at the iniquity of the reigning order: 'L'homme est ne libre, et partout il est dans 
les fers' (man is born free, and everywhere he is shackled). Its dominant ideas- 
the general will, the sovereign nation, and the Contract itself-pointed to 
solutions which would only be effectively defined, not by any ideal ruler, but by 
the interests of the governed. Whilst Voltaire appealed to the enlightened elite, 
here was Rousseau appealing to the masses. 

Rousseau's Confessions (published 1782-9) analysed the author's extremely 
uncharming personality with great charm and candour. He makes an exhibition 
of his guilt and doubt. 'He beats his breast vigorously', wrote one critic, 'in the 
knowledge that the reader will forgive him.' This preoccupation with the 
contortions of his own psychology was reminiscent of a later age. Rousseau 
despised his fellow philosophers, especially Voltaire. He was all set to tell the 
Supreme Being on Judgement Day: 'Je fus meilleur que eet homme-la!' (I was 



better than that man over there!).- 

Education was the sphere to which the ideas of the Enlightenment were most 
readily applicable. The Church held a virtual monopoly in the curricula of 
schools and universities. The influence of Renaissance humanism was long since 
diluted. In the Catholic world, Jesuit and Piarist schools for boys, and Ursuline 
schools for girls, were set in their ways. In France, pedagogy had ossified 
following the closure of both Huguenot and Jansenist schools. In the Protestant 
world, too, if Gibbon's memoirs of Oxford are to be believed, lethargy prevailed. 
The five years spent at Magdalen College', he recalled, 'were the five most idle 
and unprofitable years of my whole life.' Scotland's schools and universities 
were in much better shape, as were those in Prussia. The foundations of August 
Hermann Francke (1664-1727) at Halle and the Realschule in Berlin were 
laying the foundations both of vernacular and of technical schooling. None the 
less, the Enlightenment was pitted almost everywhere against a strongly 
entrenched religious tradition in education. D'Alembert's article in the 
Encyclopedic under 'College' raised an uproar: 

All this means, is that a young man... leaves the college after ten years, with an imperfect knowledge of a 
dead language, with precepts of rhetoric and philosophy which he should endeavour to forget: often with 
impaired health ... and more frequently with such a superficial knowledge of religion that he succumbs to 
the first blasphemous conversation 

In the long run, under the influence of the Enlightenment religious teaching was 
separated from general education; modern subjects were introduced to 
supplement the classics; and, as in Bentham's long campaign for the University 

of London, higher education was divorced from ecclesiastical patronage, 
[COMENIUS] 

Nothing, however, could rival the impact of Emile. Rousseau was not 
impressed by the methods of his fellow philosophes. 'Locke's great maxim was 
to reason with children, and that is the current vogue,' he wrote; 'but... I see no 
more stupid children than those who have been reasoned with' (Emile, bk. 11). 
Instead, he advocated 'natural education' from birth to maturity, with book 
learning forbidden before adolescence. He exploded current assumptions about 
child development. The first educational manual in the Rousseauian spirit, J. B. 
Basedow's Elementaryerk, appeared in 1770-2; his first school, the Phil- 
anthropinium at Dessau, opened its doors two years later. 

One of the boldest educational projects of the day, however, took place in 
Poland, where in 1772-3 very special circumstances gave rise to the National 


Education Commission, Europe's earliest ministry of state education. It 
coincided both with the political crisis of the First Partition, which provided the 
motivation, and with the dissolution of the Jesuits, who supplied much of the 
brain-power. Some years earlier the Polish reformers, desperate to escape from 
the Russian stranglehold on Poland, had approached Rousseau for his views; and 
his sympathetic Considerations sur le gouvernement de Pologne (1769) 
contained an all-important chapter on education. Rousseau recommended the 
creation of a single unified educational system in place of all existing 
institutions. He was taken at his word; and the last King of Poland, Stanislaw 
August Poniatowski, put it forward as the condition for submitting to the 
Partition. Poland's political prospects were sinking; but its cultural survival 
could still be won. Over the next twenty years the National Education 
Commission created some 200 secular schools, many of which were to outlast 
the destruction of the Republic. New teachers were trained. Textbooks in Polish 
language and literature, scientific subjects, and modern languages were written 
by ex-Jesuits. Tf in 200 years from now', the King wrote in his diary, 'there are 
still people who call themselves Poles, my work will not have been in vain.' 
Poland was indeed destroyed (see pp. 661-4,719, 721-2), but its culture was not. 
The National Educational Commission was closed down; but its ideals were 
carried over into the educational board of what became the western region of the 
Russian Empire. Under the enlightened management of Prince Czartoryski it 
survived until 1825, and educated the brightest generation of Polish patriots and 
literati that ever learned poetry or pushed pen.- 


COMENIUS 

When Jan Amos Komensky died in Amsterdam on 15 November 1670, he 
was generally thought to have been the chief crank of a totally lost cause. He 
was the last bishop of the sect of Czech Brethren; he had been an exile for 
nearly fifty years; and his grande oeuvre, setting forth a pansophic vision of 
universal peace and culture, remained unfinished. His prophecies regarding 
the overthrow of the pope, or the end of the world in 1672, had only excited 
ridicule. 

Born in Moravia in 1592, Komensky had spent a lifetime fighting the 





tide. Widely travelled, and educated at Heidelberg, he had hoped to remain 
headmaster of the Brethren's school at Fulnek. But the Habsburg triumph in 
Bohemia drove him in 1621 to Poland; and the persecution of pro-Swedish 
Protestants in Poland in 1657-8 drove him on to the Netherlands. He spent 
much of his energies publicizing the fate of Bohemia, writing on pedagogics, 
or acting as an itinerant educational consultant. In this latter capacity, he paid 
extended visits to England, Sweden, and Transylvania. 1 He was even invited 
to be president of Harvard. 

Yet Komensky's views were rather more coherent than his critics 
allowed. His passion for reforming education grew straight from the 
principles of the Czech Brethren, who nourished the Hussite tradition of 
reading the Bible in the vernacular. The need for language-teaching was 
obvious to someone from a multilingual province like Moravia, who had 
lived in a dozen countries. The obsession with a pacifist utopia was the 
natural product of a life hounded by war and religious conflict. 

As a polyglot author, Comenius (as he was best known) established an 
international reputation. His early Labyrinth ofthe World and Paradise of the 
Heart, a sort of spiritual pilgrimage, was written in Czech. His Janua 
Linguarum or 'Gate of Languages', which started asa trilingual textbook in 
Latin, Czech, and German, ran to hundreds of versions, including Persian 
and Turkish. His Orbis sensualium pictus (1658) or 'World in Pictures', 
which pioneered the subject of visual learning, was equally popular. His 
collected pedagogical works, Opera didactica omnia (also 1658) far 
outweighed his ephemeral political publications. Komensky's legacy grew in 
stature with time, and attracted four distinct categories of admirer. 

In religious matters, his name was honoured by those in the following 
century who revived the old sect of the Czech Brethren in the new form of 
the 'Moravian Church' (see p. 594 above). 

In the era of the Czech revival, he was raised to the status of national 
saint. Palacky compiled his biography; Count Liitzow popularized The 
Labyrinth round the world; and T. G. Masaryk saw him as the key figure in 
the history of Czech democracy and humanism. The first part of Masaryk's 
memoirs was entitled 'The Testament of Komensky'. 2 

Modern educational theorists have seen Comenius as one of the founding 
fathers of their discipline. His pupil-friendly textbooks inspired the 
progressive methods of child-centred learning developed by Froebel, 



Pestalozzi, or Montessori [bambini]. Advocates of universal education have 
quoted his texts as models before their time: 


Not the children of the rich and powerful only, but boys and girls alike, rich 
and poor, in all cities and ... villages should be sent to school.... If any ask, 
'What will be the result if artisans, rustics, porters, and even women become 
lettered? I answer: none of these will lack the material for thinking, 
choosing, following and doing good things Nor is it an obstacle that some 
seem to be naturally dull and stupid ... The slower and weaker the 
disposition of any man, the more he needs assistance... . 3 

Every child who reads a comic, consults an illustrated textbook, or 
watches a lesson on television, film, or video should hail Komensky as his 
mentor. 


From this one can see that the ideas of the Enlightenment were being used 
for different purposes in different countries. In the Netherlands and in Britain, 
they formed part of the repertoire of the liberal wing of the Establishment. They 
found expression in the British Parliament in the speeches of C. J. Fox and 
Edmund Burke. In the American colonies they were invoked by 'rebels' who 
defied that British Establishment. In France, and to a lesser extent in Spain and 
Italy, they inspired the intellectual circles who were opposing the Ancien 
Regime without having the legal means to do so. In many parts of central and 
eastern Europe, they were selectively adopted by the 'enlightened despots' who 
sought to improve their empires much as private gentlemen sought to improve 
their serf-run estates. Frederick II of Prussia or the Empress Catherine II in 
Russia certainly thought of themselves as rational and enlightened, as did 
Charles III of Spain or Leopold, Grand Duke of Tuscany, or his brother, Joseph 
II of Austria. But their relations with their philosophe consultants was often that 
of absolute master and deferential client. In this regard, Voltaire's sycophancy 
was no less developed than his wit. He rarely said what he must have thought 
about Frederick's warmongering or Catherine's persecutions. Only Rousseau 
spoke his mind to Frederick, [goose-step] 

One can also see that the ideals of the Enlightenment survived the upheavals 
of the revolutionary crisis. Enlightened reformers of the pre-revolutionary era- 
such as the Baron von Stein (1757-1831) in Prussia, the Jewish convert Baron J. 




von Sonnenfels (1732-1817) in Austria, Stanistaw Staszic (1755-1828) in 
Poland, or the Count von Montgelas (1759-1838) in Bavaria-were still active 
in 1815. Yet few of the revolutionaries who made their mark after 1789- 
Mirabeau, Danton, Condorcet, Robespierre, Saint-Just-had gained much 
prominence earlier. In this, Tom Paine was an exception, as in most things (see 
Chapter IX). 

None the less, by 1778, when both Voltaire and Rousseau died, the 
Enlightenment was starting to run out of breath. Its influence was to be strong 
for many decades. Indeed, it had assured itself a place as a permanent pillar of 
modern European thought. Yet the rationalism which originally inspired it was 
losing its force of persuasion. Pure reason was felt to be inadequate to the task of 
understanding the world and of reading the auguries of upheaval. 

Romanticism is a label which covers a multitude of sins. For the theoreticians of 
culture, the problem is so complex that some maintain there was not one 
Romanticism but several. But it refers to the titanic cultural movement which set 
in during the late eighteenth century in reaction to the waning Enlightenment. It 
was not associated in any way with formal religion. Indeed, it contained many 
features which may be considered at the very least non-Christian, if not actively 
anti-Christian. Yet its prime concerns were often directed to those spiritual and 
supernatural spheres of human experience which Religion also addressed and 
which the Enlightenment had neglected. In this sense, it is sometimes regarded 
as a reaction against the Enlightenment's overreaction against the preoccupations 
of the preceding Reformation and Counter-Reformation period. It may perhaps 
be better seen as the continuation and extension of certain strands of fashion and 
thought which, though always present, had little in common with the 
Enlightenment's ideals. These strands are often brought together under the 
headings of the 'Anti-Enlightenment' and of 'Pre-Romanticism'. 

Discussions about the Anti-Enlightenment centre on philosophical themes 
leading from the Neapolitan G. B. Vico (1668-1744) to the three East Prussians 
Hamann, Kant, and Herder. Apart from its cyclical theory of history Vico's 
Scienza nuova (1725) paid great attention to mythology, and to the symbolic 
forms of expression used by primitive societies. These were subjects which most 
of the philosophes would have rejected as simply untutored. Both Vico and 
Herder grappled with the problem of how the human mind sifts and interprets 
the colossal mass of data which is required for establishing our knowledge of the 



past and present world. Both stressed the role of historical perspective. Both 
'perceived ... that the task of synthesising such heterogeneous material into a 
coherent picture demands gifts very different from those required for rational 
methods of investigation... above all, the gift... of a creative imagination'.- 


GOOSE-STEP 

The Paradeschritt or 'Parade March' of the Prussian Army was one of the 
most unnatural and expressive movements ever invented for the human 
body. Its foreign critics called it the goose-step. The lines of jack-booted 
soldiers were trained to point their toes on every upward beat, raising their 
legs to a high horizontal position. In order to keep their balance, they had to 
lean forward, swinging their arms like cantilevers, and holding their chins in 
a characteristic jutting posture. Since every step required enormous effort, 
the musical tempo had to be moderate to slow; and the march was performed 
with a grim, deliberate air of latent menace. Fierce facial expressions were 
an essential adjunct to the soldiers' exertions. 

The body language of the goose-step transmitted a clear set of messages. 
To Prussia's generals, it said that the discipline and athleticism of their men 
would withstand all orders, no matter how painful or ludicrous. To Prussia's 
civilians, it said that all insubordination would be ruthlessly crushed. To 
Prussia's enemies, it said that the Prussian Army was not made up just of 
lads in uniform, but of regimented supermen. To the world at large, it 
announced that Prussia was not just strong, but arrogant. Here, quite literally, 
was the embodiment of Prussian militarism. 1 

The ethos of the goose-step contrasted very sharply with the parade- 
ground traditions of other armies. The French Army, for example, took great 
pride in the highly accelerated marching tempo of its light infantry, which, 
with bugles blaring, exuded the spirit of elan or 'dash' that was so much 
cultivated. The headlong charge of the Polish cavalry, who used to stop one 
foot short of the commander's saluting base, demonstrates an exhilarating 
mixture of horsemanship and showmanship. In London, the magnificently 
slow Slow March of the royal Foot Guards, with its instant of frozen motion 
in the middle of each stride, exuded a temper of serenity, confidence, and 





self-control that was quintessential British. 

The career of the goose-step has been a long one. It was recorded in the 
seventeenth century, and was still alive at the end of the twentieth. It was a 
standard feature of all military parades in Prussia and Germany until 1945. It 
was exported to all the armies of the world which were trained by Prussian 
officers, or which admired the Prussian model. In Europe, it was adopted by 
the Russian Army, later by the Red Army and by all the Soviet satellites. It 
was rejected by West Germany's Bundeswehr, but was kept in being by the 
army of the German Democratic Republic until one month before the DDR's 
collapse in November 1990. In 1994 it was still being performed in Moscow 
by the special squads of KGB troops who had been high-stepping in slow 
motion round Lenin's mausoleum for the past 70 years. 


J. G. Hamann (1730-88), who spent his life in Konigsberg and Riga, is often 
dismissed as an obscure, lightweight philosopher, writing dense, disjointed (and 
untranslated) German prose in a scatter of minor pamphlets. But his critique of 
the Enlightenment, which developed Hume's line on irrationality, was well 
known to contemporaries and is highly rated by specialists. It is even claimed 
that Hamann 'lit a fuse which set off the great romantic revolt': 

Hamann speaks for those who hear the cry of the toad beneath the harrow, even when it might be right to 
plough over him; since, if men do not hear this cry, if the toad is written off because he has been 
'condemned by history'... then such victories will prove their own undoing.- 

Of course, ideas do not permeate the cultural scene instantaneously. Several 
figures who were already active and mature in the 1770s and 1780s did not 
exercise any great influence until later. This is particularly true of Kant and 
Herder (see Chapter IX). 

Many commentators, however, would insist on Rousseau's inclusion in this 
company, since Rousseau is often seen as the first Romantic rather than the last 
of the philosophes. (There is no good reason why he should not have been both.) 
Rousseau's view of nature as something benign certainly contradicted most of 
his contemporaries, who viewed it with hostility as something to be tamed and 
corrected. Rousseau's appeal to sensibilite, the cult of emotion, initiated yet 
another shift in European manners: 


Having the tastes of a tramp, he found the restraints of Parisian society irksome. From him, the Romantics 





learnt a contempt for the trammels of convention-first in dress and manners ... and at last over the whole 
sphere of traditional morals.- 

Rousseau's love for his native Swiss Alps initiated a change in attitudes to the 
environment which until then was generally shunned in horror. Rousseau's cult 
of the common people, though accompanied by a sincere devotion to democracy, 
is sometimes seen as one of the roots of totalitarianism. 

Discussions about Pre-Romanticism usually centre on literary themes 
connected with the School of Sturm una; Drang -so-called after R M. Klinger's 
play of the same name staged in 1777-and with the Theory of Symbols. Amidst 
that 'Storm and Stress' of the 1770s, Germany, long passive, was asserting itself 
against French rationalism, and European culture was passing into a new era. A 
major impact was made by Goethe's first novella, The Sorrows of Young Werther 
(i774)> whose moody adolescent hero commits suicide. In writing the book, 
Goethe said that he had decided 'to surrender to his inner self'. It was a very 
unclassical decision. 

Yet no one had a greater impact than a Scots schoolteacher from Kingussie 
called James Macpherson (1736-96), who pulled off one of the great literary 
forgeries of all time. He presented his Fragments of Ancient Poetry (1760), 
Fingal (1761), and Femora (1763) as the translated works of the legendary 
Gaelic bard, Ossian. As Dr Johnson realized, they were nothing of the sort. But 
their melancholic recital of Highland lore was immensely popular, not least in 
Germany, where Herder was a leading admirer. An Italian translation was said to 
be Napoleon's favourite reading. 

Classical conventions came under attack in art also. In 1771, at the summer 
exhibition of the Royal Academy in London, the court painter Benjamin West 
(1738-1820) displayed a picture celebrating The Death of General Wolfe, who 
had been killed at Quebec twelve years earlier. To the scandal of the viewers, the 
scene was painted in contemporary dress. The dying general was shown in his 
regulation red army tunic. Joshua Reynolds, the senior artist of the day, took 
West on one side and lectured him on the convention of clothing all historic and 
moralistic scenes in the togas and laurels of antiquity. Paintings that defied the 
convention would lack the timeless, neutral setting which alone could ensure the 
transmission of their message. But it was to no avail: Realism had arrived. 
Whether or not Romanticism had arrived with it is a matter for conjecture.- 


The French supremacy in Europe lasted for the greater part of 200 years. It 


began with the personal rule of the young Louis XIV in 1661 and lasted until the 
fall of Napoleon in 1815. Indeed, notwithstanding her defeat during the 
Napoleonic Wars, France was not definitively replaced as the single most 
powerful state of Continental Europe until her submission to Bismarck's 
Germany in 1871. For most of that time Paris was the unrivalled capital of 
European politics, culture, and fashion, [cravate] 

France's lengthy pre-eminence can be explained in part by the natural 
advantages of her large territory and population, and by the systematic nurture of 
her economic and military resources. It must be explained in part also by the 
disarray of major rivals: by the decay of Spain, by the ruin of Germany, by the 
divisions of Italy, by Austria's preoccupation with the Ottomans. It was certainly 
assisted by the extraordinary longevity of the ruling Bourbon kings-Louis XIV 
(r. 1643-1715), Louis XV (r. 1715-74), and Louis XVI (r. 1774-92)-who 
supplied a focus for unity and stability. In the end it was undermined by the 
growing tensions within French society, and by the appearance of new powers- 
notably Great Britain, the kingdom of Prussia, and the Russian Empire, none of 
which had even existed at Louis XIV's accession. 

Like all great political organisms, France of the Ancien Regime passed 
through three distinct phases of growth, maturity, and decline. The first dynamic 
phase coincided with the central decades of Louis XIV in his magnificent prime, 
from 1661 to the end of the seventeenth century. The second phase saw France 
contained by the coalitions raised against her. It stretched from the last 
disillusioned years of Louis XIV to the death of Louis XV. The final phase 
coincided with the reign of Louis XVI. It saw the King and his ministers lose 
control of the mounting problems which led in 1789 to the outbreak of the 
greatest revolution that Europe had ever seen. For the French themselves, this 
was the era of la gloire. 


CRAVATE 

The French word cravate, 'necktie', has been taken into almost every 
European language. In German, it is krawatte, in Spanish, corbata, in Greek, 
gravata, in Romanian, cravata, in standard Polish, krawat, in Cracow, 
eccentrically, krawatka. In English, it acquired the special meaning of 'a 




linen or silk handkerchief passed once or twice round the neck outside the 
shirt collar'. 1 In the standard French Littre, it is given two alternative 
meanings: 7. Cheval de Croatie. 2. Piece d'etoffe legere que les hommes et 
quelquefois les dames mettent autour du cou.' 2 All sources agree that it 
derives from an old form of the adjective for 'Croat' or, as a Croat would 
say, hrvati. 

Exactly how an East European adjective became permanently attached to 
one of the commonest items of European clothing is a matter for conjecture. 
One theory holds that Napoleon admired the scarves worn by captured 
Habsburg soldiers. 3 This is clearly a misattribution, since Littre cites Voltaire 
using the word long before Napoleon was born: 'Vous figurez-vous ce diable 
habille d'ecarlate? ... Un serpent lui sert de cravate' (Do you see this devil 
dressed in scarlet? ... He's wearing a snake in place of a cravate). 4 

Louis XIV is perhaps nearer the mark. Croat mercenaries in the French 
service at Versailles are the likeliest source of the fashion which spread all 
over the world. At all events, people who deny the influence of Europe's 
'smaller nations' should remember that the Croats have the rest of us by the 
throat. 

In Croatia, as it happens, men can choose to adorn their necks either with 
the native masna, or with the re-imported kravata. 5 


'S'agrandir', wrote Louis XIV to the Marquis de Villars on 8 January 1688, 
'est la plus digne et la plus agreable occupation des souverains.'- (Self¬ 
aggrandisement is the most worthy and agreeable of sovereigns' occupations.) 

Louis XIV, more than any other European monarch, has been taken as the 
supreme symbol of his age. Reigning for seventy-two years over Europe's most 
powerful nation, this Roi Soleil, this Sun King, was the object of a cult which 
coloured the opinions both of his courtiers and of later historians. Ruling over 
France from his magnificent palace at Versailles, as Philip of Spain had once 
ruled the world from the Escorial, he was credited with almost superhuman 
powers. He was, supposedly, the embodiment of the purest monarchy, the most 
perfect form of absolutism; the architect and inspiration of a model and uniform 
system of government; the moving spirit of economic and colonial enterprise, 
the dictator of artistic and intellectual taste, the 'Most Christian King' of a 





Catholic nation that brooked no religious deviation, the doyen of European 
diplomacy, the commander of the Continent's most formidable armies. The myth 
is not without substance. 'Le Grand Roi' was undoubtedly the monarch whom 
lesser princes loved to emulate. He stamped his personality on his surroundings, 
and his achievements were not inconsiderable. Yet no man could ever match up 
to so exaggerated an image. Whilst conceding the grandeur of the experiment, 
one must also try to see the man behind the royal mask, the suffering land of 
France beyond the glittering facade of Versailles. 

The personality of Louis XIV cannot easily be separated from the theatrical 
performance which he felt to be an essential part of his trade. He grew up among 
the horrors of the Fronde, when the foundations of the modern French monarchy 
had been shaken to the core; and he felt instinctively that he was leader of a 
nation which longed for order and strong government. Hence the court of 
Versailles, which he designed and built, was not merely a piece of ostentation. It 
tied the nobles to the service of king and state. The spectacular royal balls, 
ballets, concerts, plays and hunts, the fetes and the fireworks in the Grand Pare, 
all served to cement the subservience of his leading subjects, and to create a 
sense of national community. From the day in 1661 when, on Mazarin's death, 
he personally assumed the reins of government, he was playing out a role with a 
purpose. It was not for mere amusement that he appeared as the leading actor in 
the first great open-air fete of his reign, Les Plaisirs de I'tile Enchante (see Plate 
47). Louis inherited from his Spanish mother the love of etiquette; and he 
learned from Mazarin the art of secrecy and dissimulation. Possessed of a 
handsome and powerful physique, he combined remarkable energies and 
appetites with a temperament that swung from the gallant and generous to the 
mean and rancorous. As a horseman, huntsman, trencherman, and sexual athlete, 
he outclassed his enthusiastic entourage. Yet whilst wining and womanizing with 
gusto, he could be plotting the ruin of his companions or, as with the great 
Nicolas Fouquet in 1661, the arbitrary arrest of his leading minister. 'Le Grand 
Roi' was not above pettiness. 

As the pupil of Richelieu and Mazarin, Louis had a firm grasp of the 
instruments that could increase his power. He inherited a huge, servile 
bureaucracy, a large standing army, a vast central treasury, and a subdued 
nobility. He further extended his control over a Gallican Church that was already 
subservient, destroyed the 'state-within-the-state' of the Huguenots, subordinated 
the provinces to his Intendants, and ruled without any form of central legislature. 
But his greatest talent was for publicity. Versailles was the symbol of an ideal 



which for outshone the facts of French reality. For Frenchmen and foreign 
visitors alike, the splendours of its ceremonies undoubtedly created the illusion 
that the Roi Soleil stood at the centre of a system of perfect authority. When 
Louis allegedly walked into the Palais de Justice and interrupted a judge with the 
comment, 'L'Etat, c'est moi', he may or may not have believed his witticism; but 
he certainly acted as if he did. Through his long series of flamboyant liaisons, 
from Louise de la Valliere to Mme de Maintenon, he flouted the moral code of 
the old cabale de devots, creating a climate where the King's pleasure was law. 
Yet behind the facade the grand experiment of absolutism was fraught with 
failures. Versailles was not France; the King's will was widely defied. In a huge 
country, the means of avoidance were greater than the means of enforcement. 
The drive for uniformity, powerful though it was, could not iron out all the 
wrinkles. The Parlement and the provinces persistently jibbed. Louis's foreign 
wars brought more debt and humiliation than solid gains. 

The government of France, therefore, cannot be understood through any 
formal analysis of its institutions. The long campaign to re-assert royal authority 
from the centre was not accompanied by the wholesale abolition of regional and 
municipal particularities. The great provinces of France remained divided 
between the pays d'election, where royal officials exercised a large measure of 
direct control, and the pays d'etat, which enjoyed a great degree of autonomy. 
Customary law operated in the north, codified Roman law in the south. Within 
each of the provinces, a mass of local libertes, parlements, franchises, and 
privileges survived; and the nobles retained many of their traditional powers of 
jurisdiction in their own domains. It was essential, of course, that the central 
Assembly, or Estates General, should only survive in a condition of permanent 
suspension, and that the central Parlement in Paris should be schooled to register 
royal decrees without discussion. The vast army of some 50,000 royal officials, 
riddled with venality and corruption, pressed like a dead weight on the whole 
country, as slow to react to royal instructions as to the needs of their local 
subjects. 

The King's main advantage lay in the absence of any major institution round 
which alternative centres of authority might have coalesced. Secure from 
concerted opposition, he was able to construct a small but extremely powerful 
complex of central organizations run by himself, together with a new network in 
the provinces which could override local objections. At the pinnacle, the King 
convened the Conseil en Haut (Supreme Council), where he discussed high 
policy two or three times every week with a small coterie of advisers. Louis 



made good an early boast to be his own chief minister. In the formative decade 
after 1661 he worked closely with the favoured triad of Le Tellier, Lionne, and 
Colbert. The formulation of advice and the execution of policy was entrusted to 
the Secretariats- initially Etranger, Guerre, Marine, and Maison du Roi -and 
to a series of secondary committees-the Conseil Royal for finance, the Conseil 
Prive for judicial decrees, the Conseil de Conscience for Religion, the Conseil de 
Justice for codifying the law. 

For the enforcement of his decisions the King relied in the early days on 
special commissions, which would be sent out to regulate specific matters. But 
increasingly he relied on his Intendants, who were soon turned from mere 
inspectors of inquiry into permanent viceroys, each overseeing the financial and 
judicial affairs of their generalites or areas of competence. In the last resort he 
relied on the military reforms, which abolished the old noble levy and created a 
huge standing army entirely subordinated to royal command. This army was an 
instrument of internal as well as external policy. 

The realities of French society bore little relation to the structures enshrined 
in the three traditional Estates. In theory, the Estates should have been 
autonomous, self-regulating communities. In practice, they were highly 
fragmented; they were deprived of any serious autonomy, and all were 
increasingly subordinated to royal control. The clergy (the First Estate) was 
alone in retaining its own organization, the quinquennial assemblies. But it was 
deprived of any corporate initiative by the King's patronage of over 600 leading 
abbatial and episcopal appointments, and by the glaring chasm of interest and 
outlook between high and low clergy. 

The nobility (the Second Estate) had been tamed by Richelieu and disgraced 
by the failure of the Fronde. It was equally divided against itself. The grandees 
were turned into royal pensioners, boasting more titles than influence. Most of 
the old noble families depended increasingly on royal service, either in the 
noblesse de robe, through legal or administrative positions, or in the noblesse 
d'epee, through army commissions. Their influence was greatly diluted by the 
influx of a mass of upstarts and promotees-the bourgeois gentilhommes of 
whom Moliere made such fun. Trouble-makers such as the petty nobles and 
robber lords of the remoter districts like the Auvergne found themselves brought 
violently to heel by hanging commissions. 

As for the Third Estate, which contained everyone not included in the other 
two, it had no chance whatsoever of developing a sense of common purpose. 



The best hope of social advancement lay in buying a royal office or a patent of 
nobility. Least concern was shown for the peasants-the absolute majority of the 
population-who remained triple-taxed serfs, oppressed by their lord, their 
priest, and the royal officials. They lived on the verge of starvation. The 
academician La Bruyere called them 'animaux farouches'. They repeatedly 
described their own condition in terms of 'la Peur', the primordial fear of 
extinction. Their frequent, desperate, and ineffectual revolts were part of the 
mral landscape. 

Economic policy constituted an important part of the Great Experiment. 
Under Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619-83), the original 'homme de marbre' and a 
bourgeois gentilhomme par excellence, a systematic plan was conceived to put 
the finances, taxes, and commerce of the country onto a sound footing. This 
Colbertisme represented a specially dirigiste form of mercantilism, and is often 
considered a failure, especially in the later period. But it was the engine which 
made all the other projects of Louis XIV possible; and it can only be judged 
against the colossal demands made by the King's truly insatiable financial 
appetite. 

In the financial sector, Colbert created the Controle General (1665) through 
which all other subordinate institutions were supervised-the Tresor de 
Vepargne (Treasury), the Conseil Royal, the Etat de Prevoyance and the Etat au 
Vrai (the annual forward estimates and balance-sheet), and the Grand Livre (the 
ledger of state accounts). From 1666 the Mint struck the handsome louis d'or 
and the silver ecu, which maintained a stable value for nearly 30 years. 

In the fiscal sector, the Caisse des Emprunts (1674) was created to raise 
money from state loans. The Ferme Generale (1680) was created to co-ordinate 
the collection of all taxes except for the notorious Taille or land-tax (which was 
left to the Intendants). After Colbert's death the budgetary deficit mounted, and a 
variety of expedients were tried, including the capitation or poll-tax in 1695, the 
billets de monnaie or paper money of 1701, and the dixieme or state tithe of 
1710. 

In the commercial sector, Colbert introduced a regime which attempted to 
lock all private activity into state regulations, and to give priority to state 
enterprise, especially in manufactures and foreign trade. The Code de la 
Draperie (1669) or 'Textile Code' was an example of his mania for detailed 
regulation. The great Vanrobais textile factory at Abbeville, or the state Gobelin 
factory brought to Paris from Brussels, were monuments to his penchant for 



manufacturing. The various state trading companies- des Indes Orientates 
(1664), des Indes Occidentales (1664), du Nord (1669), du Levant (1670)-were 
monuments to his belief that the country's total wealth could only be increased 
by what was brought in from abroad. Colbert's enthusiasm for the navy, and for 
the construction of naval ports and state arsenals, derived from the common 
mercantilist dogma that foreign trade involved an international struggle over 
finite resources. Successful competition required military force. Significantly, 
France's principal industry- agriculture-received little attention, except as the 
object of regulated prices and the source of cheap food. 

The mobilization of France's military resources required a sustained effort 
over several decades. Colbert himself laid great emphasis on the formation of a 
navy that could hold its own against the Dutch and the English. Apart from the 
traditional chiourmes or convict gangs which manned the galleys based at 
Toulon, he created a register of all the sailors and ships in the land, all liable to 
conscription. In twenty years he increased the ships of the line from 30 to 107, of 
which the four-masted Royal-Louis, armed with 118 cannons, was the pride and 
joy. He founded the naval base of Rochefort, fortified the northern ports of Brest, 
Le Havre, Calais, and Dunkerque, and opened naval dockyards and naval 
academies. 

For obvious reasons, however, France looked more to its land borders than to 
the sea. Louis XIV set foot aboard one of his warships on only one occasion. 
Under the Bureau de guerre of Colbert's chief rival, the ruthless war minister 
Francois Michel Le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois (1641-91), the main effort was 
devoted to the army. Louvois's bureaucrats took control of every detail. The old 
noble levy was abandoned and regimental structures revolutionized. New 
formations of grenadiers (1667), fusiliers (1667), and bombardiers (1684) were 
created. The traditional supremacy of the cavalry was handed to the infantry. 
Subjected to rigorous drill and training, armed with flintlock and bayonet, and 
dressed in fine uniforms, the new formations foreshadowed the practices of the 
eighteenth century. The artillery and the corps of engineers, once contracted out 
to civilians, were integrated into the overall command. Professional officers, 
trained in military academies and promoted on merit, were led by commanders 
of renown- first the old Turenne, then the young Conde and the dashing 
Marechal du Villars. Massive barracks and arsenals were built in all the major 
cities. On the initiative of the celebrated siege-master, ingenieur du roi and 
commissaire-general des fortifications, Marshal Sebastien Le Prestre de Vauban 
(1633-1707), a magnificent chain of 160 fortresses was constructed along the 



northern and eastern frontiers. The likes of Saarlouis, Landau, Neubreisach, and 
Strasbourg cost France even more than Versailles. The net result was a military 
machine that could only be stopped by the concerted strength of all France's 
neighbours. Its motto was Nee pluribus impar (a match for many), [elsass] 

Religion stood necessarily near the centre of affairs. Louis XIV displayed 
little more than conventional Catholic piety, but he was guided by the tradition 
which demanded that le Roi Tres Chretien should be master in his own house, 
and that religious dissidence posed a threat to national unity. After his secret 
second marriage to Mme de Maintenon in 1685, he was strongly influenced by 
the advice of Jesuits. The overall result was one of considerable inconsistency 
and, as in other spheres, of striking contrast between the King's early and 
declining years. In 1669, when Moliere's long-delayed anticlerical satire Tartuffe 
was finally performed, it received the royal applause; in 1680 it was banned. 

For thirty years Louis was a true Gallican-packing the French bishoprics 
with the relatives of his ministers, authorizing the Declaration of the Four 
Articles (1682), and provoking in 1687-8 an open rupture with the Papacy. The 
Four Articles, the purest formulation of Gallican doctrine, were ordered to be 
taught in all the seminaries and faculties of France: 

1. The authority of the Holy See is limited to spiritual 
matters. 

2. The decisions of Church Councils are superior to those 
of the Pope. 

3. Gallican customs are independent of Rome. 

4. The Pope is not infallible, except by consent of the 
universal Church. 

But then, distressed by his isolation from the Catholic powers, Louis turned tail. 
In 1693 he retracted the Four Articles, and for the rest of his life gave unstinting 
support to the ultramontane faction. His decree of 1695, handing the episcopate 



full control over the livings and property of the parish clergy, earned him the 
lasting opposition of the radicals. In the quarrel over Quietism, his decision to 
favour the bombastic Bishop Bossuet, 'the Eagle of Meaux', against the 
Quietists' champion, Bishop Fenelon, 'the Swan of Cambrai', offended both the 
aristocratic and the more spiritual elements. After all, it was Bossuet who had 
once enjoined Louis 'to be a god for his people 5 . 

In his policy towards the Protestants, Louis passed from passive 
discrimination through petty harassment to violent persecution. At first, under 
Mazarin's tutelage, the King felt disinclined to dismpt a community that had 
demonstrated its loyalty throughout the wars of the Fronde. From the weavers of 
Abbeville to the great Turenne himself, the Huguenots were hard-working and 
influential. Unfortunately, breaches of the Edict of Nantes and the supposedly 
preferential treatment of the 'RPR 5 (religion pretendue reformee or 'so-called 
reformed religion 5 ) were the two issues which united all wings of Catholic 
opinion. Hence from 1666 all Huguenot activities not specifically approved by 
the Edict were regarded as illegal. The first chapels were razed; a caisse des 
conversions or 'conversion fund 5 was created to reward the NCs (nouveaux 
converts) at six livres per head. From 1679 a series of legal and military 
measures sought to extirpate Protestantism by. force. In the vicious dragonnades 
of Poitou, Beam, and Languedoc, where soldiers were billeted on all families 
refusing conversion, unspeakable atrocities were committed. Finally in October 
1685, pressed by Louvois (Le Tellier), and the depraved Archbishop of Paris, 
Harlay de Champvallon, the King revoked the edict of toleration. Bishop 
Bossuet awarded him the epithet of the 'New Constantine 5 . Up to a million of 
France's most worthy citizens were forced to submit or to flee amidst a veritable 
reign of terror. Resistance in the Dauphine and the Cevennes persisted for thirty 
years. 

Similarly, in its treatment of the Jansenists, royal policy wavered between 
compromise and repression. Jansen's ideas were eagerly received by one wing of 
the French Church, and were widely disseminated through the works of the 
Abbe de St Cyran (1581-1643), of Antoine Arnauld I (1612-94), and, above all, 
of Blaise Pascal. Jansenist activities centred on the Cistercian convent of Port- 
Royal in Paris and on the ubiquitous Arnauld clan, who had strong connections 
at Court-with the King's cousin, Mme de Longueville, with the King's foreign 
minister, Simon Arnauld, Marquis de Pomponne (1616-99), with Racine, a 
former pupil of Port-Royal's school, even with Bossuet. But from the 1650s, 
when the 'Five Propositions' taken from Jansen's Augustinus were officially 



judged heretical, the Jansenists were treated as subversives. Pascal and others 
were forced to publish in secret. In 1661 a Formulation of Obedience 
denouncing the Propositions caused an open breach; and the sisters of Port- 
Royal, 'pure as angels, proud as demons', were rusticated to a new location at 
Port-Royal-les-Champs near Versailles. This first round of persecution ended in 
the strange Paix de I'Eglise (1668), which enabled the Jansenists to sign the 
Formulation whilst upholding their conscientious objections 'in respectful 
silence'. But further attacks were launched in concert with the campaign against 
the Huguenots. Arnauld le Grand was driven into exile at Brussels in 1679. 

The decisive round followed the publication in 1693 of the Reflexions of the 
Oratorian Pasquier Quesnel (1634-1719). When the ensuing furore became 
entangled with the other feud between Bishops Bossuet and Fenelon over 
Quietism, the King resolved to act. In 1705 the Pope was persuaded to retract the 
compromise regarding 'respectful silence', and in 1713 the Bull Unigenitus 
comprehensively condemned the Jansenists and all their works. In the process 
the convent of Port-Royal was closed, its church destroyed, its cemetery razed. 
The remains of Pascal and Racine had to be rescued from their tombs by night. 
At a stroke, Louis turned a doctrinal squabble into a lasting confrontation 
between the reigning Establishment of Church and State and its intellectual 
critics. Here lay the true beginning of the French Enlightenment. 

Nothing has been more schematized in the history books than the policy of 
Louis XIV to the arts. This 'Intellectual Absolutism' is sometimes described as a 
model where royal taste and patronage could determine the entire cultural life of 
an age. 'Classicism is made to appear as an official doctrine corresponding on 
the literary plane to the doctrines of monarchical order and religious unity which 
prevailed in the political and spiritual spheres.'^ In the words of Nicolas 
Boileau (1636-1711), the principal literary critic of the day, 'Un Auguste 
aisement peut faire des Virgiies' (an Augustus can easily create Virgils). 


ELSASS 

One day in 1670 the French army seized the Rhine bridge at Strassburg, 
and burned it. This was the signal that the French were not content with the 
part of Elsass acquired by the Treaty of Westphalia, and would not rest until 





Strassburg itself was theirs. At the time. Strassburg was the second city of 
the Holy Roman Empire, entirely German in character, its language the same 
Alemannic dialect spoken on the other side of the Rhine. But Louis XIV was 
implacable. Thanks to the dubious stratagem of the Reunions, Strassburg, or 
Strasbourg, would soon be absorbed, together with the whole of 'Alsace'. 
Though the local dialect would survive, the province would become the 
touchstone of French unity. 1 German restorations, in 1870-1918 and 1940- 
5, would not last. 

On the other, eastern flank of the Empire, in Silesia, the great city of 
Breslau was ruled on behalf of the Austrian Habsburgs by the last prince of 
the Silesian Piasts. Silesia's origins were no more Austrian than Alsace was 
French. Silesia's first connections were Polish and. until 1526, Bohemian. 
Just as the native language and culture of Alsace were to resist every attempt 
to Frenchify them completely, so the Silesian Slavs would hold out against 
the waves of Bohemian Germans, Austrians, and Prussians who came to 
dominate their province over the centuries. 2 

On the other, eastern flank of Poland, in the province of Red Ruthenia, 
the great city of Lwow had been ruled by Poland for over 300 years. It was 
far more Polish than Strasburg was French or Breslau Austrian. Its Jewish 
community, too, had enjoyed great continuity. Yet the origins of Lwow or 
L'viv were not Polish but Ruthenian. In 1670, its career as a premier centre 
of Uniate, Ukrainian culture was in its infancy. 3 [Ayczakow] 

On the other, eastern flank of Ruthenia, the great city of Kiev on the 
Dnieper had just been conquered by Moscow (see p. 556). The Russian 
Orthodox Church was establishing its supremacy over central Ukraine, and 
launching the myth that Kiev was the cradle of Russian civilization. 

Strassburg, Breslau, Lwow, .and Kiev had more in common than they knew. 
All were cosmopolitan capitals of multinational provinces or countries, for 
whom exclusive national claims would prove particularly destructive. By 
1945, each had been re-laundered many times. Alsace had changed hands 
between France and Germany four times over. Silesia (alias Slqsk or 
Schlesien) had been fought over regularly by Austria, Prussia, Germany, and 
Poland. Red Ruthenia (alias East Galicia, Western Ukraine, or eastern 
Malopolska) had been disputed by Austrians, Poles, and Ukrainians at least 
six times. Central Ukraine had been torn apart by Russians and Germans, 



Ukrainians and Poles, Reds and Whites, Nazis and Soviets, at least twenty 
times. 

When Strasbourg was made capital of the Council of Europe in 1949, the 
Iron Curtain shut out the city's eastern counterparts. Indeed, since the 
German population of Breslau had been forced to leave, since Breslau had 
just become Wroclaw through the mass influx of Polish refugees from 
Lwow, and since L'viv was swamped by an influx of Russians, resentments 
were running high. The internal frontiers of the Soviet bloc were every bit as 
impermeable as the Iron Curtain. The process of reconciliation, which 
started in the West, could not reach the whole of Europe for almost fifty 
years. 


It is true, of course, that lavish royal patronage did provide a powerful 
stimulus in the direction of institutionalized uniformity. The Academie Frangaise 
(1635), whose great Dictionary appeared in 1694, acted as the official guardian 
of the French language. The Academie de Peinture et de Sculpture, later the 
Beaux-Arts, put enormous powers into the hands of the King's painter, Charles 
Le Brun (1619-90). The Academie des Sciences (1666) pursued similar 
activities to those of the Royal Society in London. The Academie de Musique 
(1669) offered a similar platform for the talents of the King's musician, Jean- 
Baptiste Lully (1633-87), who wrote a score of operas. At the Beaux-Arts, 
which linked the artistic dictatorship of Le Brun with the organizational genius 
of Colbert, architects, decorators, engravers were mobilized into projects where 
harmony and order were the ruling passions. Above all, the royal Court 
commanded a concentration of cultural creativity with few parallels. In 
literature, 'the King's Four Friends'-Boileau, Moliere, Racine, and La Fontaine 
-exercised an influence in their heyday which few writers have ever enjoyed. 
The Comedie-Fran^aise (1680) joined several existing troupes into one united, 
theatrical operation. 

Yet on examination it becomes clear that the classical monopoly was more 
illusory than real. For one thing, the King's own taste was more eclectic than is 
often supposed. The classical mania for formulating artistic rules was certainly 
present, but the rules were not necessarily observed by everyone. For another, 
the 'Classical Parnassus' which reigned for perhaps twenty years was gradually 
undermined. From 1687 onwards French cultural Ufe was absorbed by the 




furious quarrel of the Anciens and the Modernes. The facade of unity was 
cracked wide open, to expose a cultural landscape of variety and heterodoxy 
from which the parade of the giants has all too often diverted attention. 

The foreign policy of Louis XTV was the best measure of his power and 
prestige. It rested on the most complete diplomatic service which Europe had 
ever seen-personally run by the King at Versailles-and on military forces 
which were only deployed in full after a long period of preparation. It led the 
continent of Europe into conflict. As a result, Louis XIV has been seen in some 
quarters as the first of a line of tyrants who have tried to conquer Europe by 
force, the precursor of Napoleon or Hitler. The coalitions ranged against him can 
be made to appear as the ancestors of the 'Allied Powers' of later centuries. 

In reality, Louis's vision was rather limited. Despite later comment, he does 
not seem to have had any clear plan for attaining France's 'natural frontiers', let 
alone for overrunning the Continent. Though the caution of his early years was 
abandoned, his aims remained essentially dynastic and consolidatory. Having 
been linked by Mazarin to a Spanish Infanta, Maria Teresa, whom he married at 
Saint Jean-de-Luz in 1660 as part of the Treaty of the Pyrenees, he could not 
have avoided the problems presented by Spain's crumbling succession. His 
constant involvement in the Netherlands and on the Rhine was justified by a 
genuine fear of encirclement. His thirst for war and expansion can hardly be 
compared to that of his brother monarchs in, say, Sweden or Russia. His love for 
la gloire might have seemed entirely conventional had it not been backed by 
such threatening logistics. Of Louis's four major wars, the first two were 
confined to the Netherlands; the third was provoked by the reunions -Louis's 
campaign to acquire German territory by judicial subterfuge. The fourth arose 
directly from the failure of the ruling Spanish dynasty. Behind them all lay 
international rivalry over colonies and trade, [grotemarkt] 

The War of Devolution (1667-8) derived from Louis's exploitation of a 
dynastic claim to Brabant. It began with a French invasion of the Spanish 
Netherlands; inspired a 'Triple Alliance' of England, Holland, and Sweden; and 
ended at the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle with Louis in possession of twelve 
Belgian fortresses. 

The Franco-Dutch War (1672-9) derived from Louis's determination to 
punish the Dutch for their interference in his previous campaign. It was 
thoroughly prepared diplomatically, with Holland's maritime rivals, England and 
Sweden, persuaded to switch their allegiance, and with Poland added to the 



French camp. It turned William III of Orange, Stadtholder of the United 
Provinces, into coordinator of the opposition. It began, as before, with a French 
advance into the Spanish Netherlands; but Conde's crossing of the Rhine roused 
the Empire; and Louis did not miss the chance to disrupt Spain's hold on the 
Franche-Comte. The Congress of Nijmegen (1678-9) saw Louis's diplomats 
holding the ring-appeasing the Dutch with commercial advantages, forcing the 
Spaniards to cede territory, imposing a settlement on the lesser powers. 

By the policy of reunions, Louis suspended open warfare in favour of 
annexations arranged through elaborate but dubious legal process. Courts were 
established to try royal petitions laying claim to scores of cities and jurisdictions 
on the eastern border. Every favourable verdict led to immediate occupation of 
the district concerned. No less than 160 annexations were organized in this way 
in the 1680s, notably Strassburg (1681) and Luxemburg (1684). With the Empire 
preoccupied by the Turkish advance on Vienna, Louis had timed the operation 
well. 

The Nine Years War (1689-97) occurred as the result of Louis's defiance of 
the League of Augsburg (1686), formed at the instigation of William of Orange 
to halt further French adventures. The French invasion of the Spanish 
Netherlands and of the Palatinate, where Heidelberg was devastated, initiated an 
exhausting series of sieges and naval battles. By the Treaty of Ryswick (1697) 

Louis was obliged to abandon most of his reunions, but not Strasbourg, [elsass] 
[GROTEMARKT] 

The War of the Spanish Succession (1701-13) has some claim to be called 
'the first world war'. It was fought in Germany, in the Netherlands, in Italy, in 
Spain, in the colonies, and on the high seas. It was brewing from the day in 1700 
when Charles II of Spain died childless, and when Louis XIV decided to honour 
the late King's will and to neglect his own undertakings. It was unavoidable once 
Louis had presented the court with his youthful grandson, Philippe d'Anjou, 
with the words 'Void le Roi d'Espagne'. It brought together the most extensive 
and powerful of anti-French coalitions, which was managed on the military front 
by the triumvirate of Prince Eugene of Savoy, the Duke of Marlborough, and the 
Grand Pensioner Heinsius. The fighting began when Louis took the precaution 
of reoccupying the Dutch-held 'barrier fortresses' in the Spanish Netherlands. It 
carried on through siege and countersiege, on land and sea, until all parties were 
thoroughly drained. In 1709, after the 'very murdering' but indecisive battle of 
Malplaquet, which saved France from invasion, Marshal du Villars was said to 
have told his sovereign, 'One more victory like that for your enemies, Sire, and 



they will all be finished.' 

The final outcome of the French wars, as enshrined in the twin treaties of 
Utrecht (1713) and Rastatt (1714), did not match the expectations of any of the 
principal combatants. France's ambitions were trimmed but not reversed. She 
kept many important gains, including Lille, Franche-Comte, and Alsace; and 
Philippe d'Anjou remained on the Spanish throne. The Dutch, like the French, 
were exhausted, but survived with the control of the barrier fortresses. Spain, 
which had lost out when allied to the anti-French coalitions, lost out again when 
allied to the French. The Spaniards' main purpose was to preserve the unity of 
their empire. They found that they provoked the very catastrophe which they had 
sought to avoid. The Austrians, who had sought to prevent the Spanish 
inheritance from falling to France, settled instead for a major share of the 
pickings, including the Spanish Netherlands, Milan, Naples, and Sardinia. It was 
the peripheral powers who proved the most obvious beneficiaries. Both the 
Hohenzollerns in Prussia and the House of Savoy were confirmed in their royal 
status. The former took Upper Gelderland on the Rhine and, with some delay, 
Swedish Pomerania; the latter took Sicily. The new United Kingdom of Great 
Britain (see below) gained immensely in status, confirmed in her control of 
Gibraltar and Minorca, of Newfoundland and other American lands, and of the 
Spanish colonial trade. The United Kingdom-no longer just England-now 
emerged as the foremost maritime power, as the leading diplomatic broker, and 
as the principal opponent of French supremacy. 

From its high point early in the 1680s, therefore, Louis XIV's Great 
Experiment produced ever diminishing returns. The wars, the religious 
persecutions, the deaths of all the great personalities, were accompanied by 
failures of a more deep-seated nature. Both the French state and French society 
were showing signs of a long wasting disease. The state's finances, for example, 
passed into grave disarray. By 1715 the Government's net income stood at 69 
million livres, and expenditure at 132 million; the public debt was variously 
computed at between 830 to 2,800 million. - More seriously, the mass of the 
French population was gaining little benefit from a life of increasing deprivation: 
the scandalous exemptions of the nobility continued; the middle classes, sorely 
wounded by the departure of the Huguenots, were struggling to ease the burdens 
of state regulation; the peasants toiled on the verge of starvation and without 
hope of relief. In the years of famine, contemporary reports of their dire distress 
-of barefoot starvelings eking out a subsistence on a diet of bark, berries, and 
beet-are supported by modern statistical studies of mortality and food prices. 


The long procession of provinces in open and bloody revolt continued-Bearn 
(1664), the Vivarais (1670), Bordeaux (1674), Brittany (1675), Languedoc 
(1703-9), Cahors (1709). Rural riots and outbreaks of chateau-burning were 
mercilessly punished with military repressions and mass hangings. The facade 
still glittered, but the foundations were starting to shake. When Louis XIV 
finally died, on 1 September 1715, the curtain fell to the ringing words which 
began the funeral oration: 'Dieu seul, mes freres,' intoned Bishop Massillon, 
'Dieu seul est grand' (my brothers, God alone is great). 


GROTE MARKT 

In 1695 the Grote Markt or Grand'Place of Bmssels was reduced to cinders 
when one of France's more inept marshals, the Duke of Villeroi, bombarded 
the city with red-hot shot. In that one engagement, when the armies of Louis 
XIV advanced into the Spanish Netherlands, they destroyed sixteen 
churches, 4,000 houses, and a civic square which has been described as 'a 
perfect image in stone of our European political culture at its finest'. 1 

Laid out in the decades after 1312, when Brussels was granted its charter, 
the expanse of the Grote Markt had seen the jousting tournaments of the 
Dukes of Brabant and of Burgundy. On the south side, the Gothic City Hall 
supported a slender, soaring belfry 160 ft high, surmounted by a gilded 
statue of St Michael. Opposite, the Renaissance Maison du Roi had housed 
many dukes but never a king. On either flank rose the tall guild houses of the 
'nine nations', among them the 'Bakers' Dome' of Le Roi d'Espagne, the 
statued facade of the Archers' House, La Louve, and the poop-shaped upper 
storey of the 'Boat-Builders'. In front of them, the cobbled pavement had 
witnessed the hanging of Egmont and Horn. In 1795 it would resound to 
Dumouriez's declaration of the French Republic, and in 1830 to skirmishes 
with Dutch troops. Nowadays, it is the setting for the annual Ommegang 
procession, headed by actors playing out 'the court of Charles V'. Otherwise 
it has been taken over by flower-sellers, the Sunday bird market and, until 
recently, by parking lots. 

Brussels was handsomely restored under Austrian rule after 1713, and 
extensively renovated when it became capital of the Kingdom of Belgium in 




1830. In the nineteenth century, linked by a 'pentagon' of boulevards, the 
new districts spread over the nearby hills. The Coudenberg received the 
royal, palace, the government ministries, and the Parliament. The 
Koekelberg, in imitation of Montmartre, received the grandiose domed 
basilica of the Sacre-Coeur, completed only in 1970. The gleaming metallic 
molecule of the Atomium recalls the Universal Exhibition of 1958. The 
modern Cite deBerlaymont (1967) houses the headquarters of the European 
Commission, Zaventem the headquarters of NATO. Since 1971, Brussels- 
Bruxelles has formed a bi-lingual region within Belgium's three linguistic 
cantons-equal in legal status to its Flemish-speaking, French-speaking, and 
German-speaking counterparts. Originally a predominantly Flemish city, it 
now displays the most complicated linguistic patterns, including French, 
Turkish, and even English sectors.. 

Sentimental observers have seen Brussels as a fitting capital for the 
future Europe because it has supposedly overcome its own and its 
neighbours' nationalism. It has been described as the mouth of a 'tunnel of 
history', reaching back under the dark mountain of modern nationalism to 
'the wonderful model' of 'multicultural', 'polyphonic Burgundy'. 2 It may be 
so. But extravagant intellectual pretensions do not fit the local style. From 
his pedestal on a street corner just off the Grote Markt, the statue of the 
Manneken Pis, the jovial 'Fittle Piddle Boy' (1619), who survived Villeroi's 
bombardment, expresses the healthiest of opinions on all such conceits. 


France of the eighteenth century was entirely the child of Fouis XTV's great 
but flawed experiment. The intellectual ferment of the French Enlightenment 
was a natural reaction against the political and social immobility of the Ancien 
Regime which Fouis had created. Both external and internal policy were devoted 
to the maintenance of the status quo in all spheres. The innate conservatism of 
the system was bolstered by the initial shock of John Faw's risky projects, which 
seemed to discredit the very notion of change and reform. It was solidified by 
the minority (1715-23) of Fouis XV, when the reins of government were held by 
a polished but debauched Regent, the Due d'Orleans, and by the young king's 
long subordination to his elderly tutor Andre, Cardinal de Fleury (1653-1743). 
The Regent rashly restored the Parlement's right of remonstration against royal 
decrees-a classic recipe for endless mischief without responsibility. The 




Cardinal supervised an era of competent stability, marked only by diplomatic 
crises and a violent resurgence of the controversy over Jansenism. The personal 
reign of Louis XV (1723-74), who paid more attention to hunting women and 
stags than to governing the country, was one of debilitating stagnation. The 
perpetual financial crisis, fuelled by recurrent wars, turned the clashes between 
court and Parlement into ? routine spectacle. The religious feuds between the 
ultramontanes, Gallicans, and Jansenists, which culminated in 1764 with the 
expulsion of the Jesuits, degenerated into a ritual round of spite and 
obscurantism. The chasm between court and people yawned ever wider. The 
most memorable personality of the age must surely be that of Jeanne Poisson, 
Mme de Pompadour (1721-64)-intelligent, influential, and totally helpless. She 
did what she could to relieve the King's unspeakable boredom, and is credited 
with that most telling of remarks, 'Apres nous le deluge', [Corsica] [dessein] 

Louis XVI no doubt looked forward to a reign as long and as boring as that 
of his grandfather. He even saw the need for reform. But he was the first prisoner 
of the Ancien Regime. On the day that the Deluge broke, on 14 July 1789, his 
diary contained the entry which his grandfather had always used on days when 
there was no hunting-'Rien' (nothing). 

In the British Isles the capital event of the period, the founding of the United 
Kingdom (1707), occurred as the culmination of complicated religious, dynastic, 
constitutional, and international conflicts. The Restoration of the Stuarts after the 
Civil War had ushered in an uneasy stand-off, and the reign of Charles II (d. 
1685) survived two Dutch wars, the fraudulent Popish Plot of 1679, and two 
rebellions of Scottish Covenanters. Like his father, the King submitted 
unwillingly to government through Parliaments and did his best to circumvent 
them. His religious policy steered a middle course between the extreme 
Protestant and Catholic factions. The return of the Anglican supremacy put 
limits on toleration. It was characterized in England by the Clarendon Code and 
Test Acts and in Ireland and Scotland by the reimposition of episcopacy. In 
foreign policy there was great dissension over fighting the Dutch on commercial 
grounds or supporting them on religious and strategic grounds. [LLOYD'S] 



CORSICA 


It is a moot point whether Napoleon Bonaparte was born a subject of the 
King of France. His elder brother, Joseph, was certainly not. The island of 
Corsica was sold to Louis XV by the Republic of Genoa in a deal that was 
not confirmed by the island's assembly until September 1770, when 
Napoleon was one year old. Napoleon's father had served as secretary to 
Pasquale Paoli, who had led the revolt against Genoa and who would lead 
another against the rule of the Jacobin Convention, before dying in England. 

Corsica had a long history of self-government, the terra di commune, 
going back to the eleventh century. It survived under Pisan, Genoan, and 
French royal suzerainty, until suppressed by the French Republic. 

Since 1793, Corse has been incorporated into metropolitan France as 
Departement 90; but its individual character is very marked, and local 
separatism has always been present. The regional law of 1982 returned a 
measure of autonomy, but not enough to eliminate anti-French terrorism. 
The illegal Corsican National Liberation Front can be compared to the ETA 
of the Basque provinces in Spain or to the IRA in Northern Ireland. 1 Despite 
a widespread stereotype, terrorist-style nationalism is not confined to Eastern 
Europe or the Balkans. 


All these issues came to a head after 1685, when Charles was succeeded by 
his brother, James II (r. 1685-8 (1701))-a militant Catholic, an absolutist, and a 
client of Louis XTV. His accession was marked by two more unsuccessful 
rebellions-by the Duke of Argyll in Scotland and by the Duke of Monmouth in 
England. When the King tried to widen the toleration acts to include Catholics, 
the dominant Protestant and Parliamentary party in England-henceforth known 
as 'Whigs'-forced a showdown on their royalist opponents-henceforth known 
as 'Tories'. The spectre of civil and religious strife beckoned, though trimmers 
of every hue, like the Anglo-Irish Vicar of Bray, were ready to keep their 
positions at any cost: 





When royal James possessed the throne 
And Popery came in fashion, 

The Penal Laws I hooted down 
And signed the Declaration. 

The Church of Rome I found did fit 
Full well my constitution; 

And I had been a Jesuit 
But for the Revolution. 

And this is Law that I'll maintain, 

Until my dying day, Sir! 

That whatsoever King may reign, 

I'll be the Vicar of Bray, Sir!- 

James put his faith in mobilizing French support, and succeeded in fleeing 
abroad at the second attempt. 

The Protestant victory was secured by the firm action of the Dutch 
Stadholder, William of Orange, the husband of James's daughter Mary, who was 
determined to stop England from falling into Louis's net. Landing at Torbay on 5 
November 1688 with a powerful army of mercenaries, he cleared London of 
English troops without resistance, and estabUshed a position of unassailable 
strength. Only then did he summon the Convention Parliament which was to 
carry out the 'glorious' and 'bloodless' revolution and to offer him the English 
throne jointly with his wife.- Here was a resolution which suited all the main 
participants. The States General of the United Provinces, who paid for the 
operation, were content to see their Stadholder in a stronger position abroad than 
in the Netherlands. William was content to have greatly increased his resources 
for fighting the French. The English 'Whigs' were content to have a foreign king 
whom they could control more easily than the Stuarts. 

In England, the 'Revolution' was confirmed by the Declaration and the Bill 
of Rights and by another Toleration Act (which admitted Protestant dissenters 
but not Catholics). It was closely allied to new constitutional arrangements 
which shifted the balance away from the Crown and towards Parliament. In 
Ireland, it was achieved by bloody conquest and the triumph of 'King Billy' and 
his 'Orangemen' at the Battle of the Boyne on 1 (11) July 1690. It perpetuated 
the Protestant supremacy in a largely Catholic country. In Scotland, it was sealed 
by the treacherous Massacre of Glencoe (1692)-where the murder of the 
Catholic Clan Macdonald by the English-backed Campbells marked the onset of 


a war to the death between Lowlands and Highlands. Internationally, it was 
accompanied by the engagement of England and Scotland in the League of 
Augsburg, and in all subsequent coalitions against Louis XIV. 


LLOYD'S 

On18 February 1688 the London Gazette mentioned a coffee-house run 
by Edward Lloyd in Tower Street. Shortly afterwards Lloyd launched a 
weekly bulletin, the precursor of Lloyd's List, providing news about 
commerce and shipping. By so doing, he supplied both a meeting-place and 
an information service for all interested in the insurance business. Lloyd's 
would grow into the world's largest insurance association. Transferred to the 
Royal Exchange, it issued its first standardized policy in 1774. It was 
reorganized in 1811 [tabard], its privileges confirmed by statute in 1888. It 
provides the point of contact between the syndicates of 'names', who 
subscribe the capital, and the firms of 'underwriters', who share out the 
cover on every policy issued. 

The insurance business sells security. Its roots can be traced to the 
trading cities of medieval Italy, where the principle of 'mutuality', or risk¬ 
sharing, was clearly understood. It was one of the preconditions for the 
growth of commerce. Its acceleration in the eighteenth century reflects the 
wider growth of security in many other spheres. 

Initially, the culture of insurance was the preserve of a tiny mercantile 
elite, [mercante] But it steadily extended its frontiers-first into new areas 
of risk, such as fire, life, accident, and health; secondly into new social 
constituencies; and thirdly into new, less commercialized regions of Europe. 
By the mid-nineteenth century, governments were beginning to ponder the 
benefits of universal insurance schemes; and in 1888 the German 
government introduced a health and pension scheme for all state employees. 
By the late twentieth century the concept of 'social security', accessible to 
everyone by right, was a widely accepted ideal. 

Insurance had far-reaching implications in the realm of social 
psychology. If chronic insecurity had encouraged traditional beliefs in 
religion and [magic], the advance of material security was bound to have its 




effect on popular responses to the great imponderables of luck and death. In 
1693 the Royal Society commissioned Edmund Halley to prepare a 
statistical report on 'The Degrees of Mortality of Mankind'. It was worried 
by a recent financial disaster resulting from annuities sold without reference 
to age. Halley found that the only suitable data came from Breslau (now 
Wroclaw) in Austrian Silesia, where the registration of deaths included the 
age of the deceased. By analysing 6,193 births and 5,869 deaths in Breslau 
for the years 1687-91, he was able to draw up a table, showing the age 
cohorts of the population, the estimated population totals in each cohort, and 
the annual number of deaths at each age. From this he demonstrated the 
principle of life expectancy and the varying probabilities of death. Halley's 
'Breslau Table' was the pioneer of all actuarial calculations. It robbed 
Providence of its monopoly on human mortality. 


The 'Glorious Revolution' of 1688-9, therefore, was not specially glorious 
nor revolutionary. It set out to save the political and religious Establishment from 
James's radical proposals; and it was brought to fruition through the only 
successful invasion of England since 1066. Yet in subsequent generations it 
would spawn a powerful myth. It lay at the root of a constitutional doctrine 
which came to be known as 'the English ideology', and which postulates the 
absolute sovereignty of Parliament. This doctrine holds that 'absolute despotic 
power', as the jurist Blackstone put it, had been transferred from the monarch to 
the elected Parliament. In theory at least, it gives Parliament the power to rule 
with all the lofty authoritarianism that was previously enjoyed by England's 
kings. In this it differs fundamentally from the doctrine of the sovereignty of the 
people, which most other European countries were to acquire from the example 
either of the USA or of revolutionary France, and which operates through a 
formal constitution governing all branches of the polity. It inevitably became the 
flagship not only of Protestant but also of English supremacy within Great 
Britain, since English MPs could always engineer a majority over the non- 
English members. It was destined to survive all the changes of subsequent 
centuries; 300 years later, it would still be offering one of the principal obstacles 
to Britain's entry into a united European Community.- 

Dynastic complications rendered the ultimate outcome uncertain for 25 
years. From 1701, Louis XIV formally recognized the claims of James Edward 





Stuart, the 'Old Pretender' or 'James III' (1688-1766), whilst the deaths of Mary 
(1694), of William III (1702), and of all 17 children of Queen Anne (r. 1702-14) 
rendered the Protestant Stuarts heirless. In the middle of the War of the Spanish 
Succession, no one needed to be reminded of the mischief which heirlessness 
could wreak; and the Act of Union (1707) between England and Scotland largely 
came about as a result of common frustration in London and Edinburgh at the 
welter of dynastic settlements being floated. As the price of its disbandment, the 
Scots Parliament was able to secure English acceptance of free trade between the 
two countries, English cash for settling Scotland's huge debts, English 
agreement to the separate existence of Scots law and the Presbyterian Kirk, and 
the unwritten promise of English armed force against the rebellious Highlands 
(see Appendix III, p. 1285). 

Henceforth, the 'United Kingdom of Great Britain' was to be ruled by a joint 
Parliament at Westminster; and a new 'British' nationality was to be 
superimposed on the older nations of the islands. Modern British identity derives 
from this time. English traditions were to be revered. Memories of Scotland's 
separate history were to be subverted. Britain entered the era of its greatest 
assertiveness, free from insular divisions. The choice of the Hanoverians as 
successors to the Stuarts, though hotly contested, was carried through. 
Thereafter, a monarchy which was neither English nor Scottish became a pillar 
of Britishness.- [gotha] [mason] 

The Jacobite cause, which persisted for much of the eighteenth century, 
encompassed all that was lost in the events of 1688-1714. Apart from the 
personal fortunes of the Old Pretender and his son, Charles Edward Stuart, 
variously known as the 'Young Pretender', 'Bonnie Prince Charlie', and 
'Charles III' (1720-88), it united all the wounded feelings connected with the 
defeated order. It mourned the demise of the old monarchies, of English 
Catholicism and its European connections, of the rights of the Scots and the Irish 
to control their own destinies. In England it commanded the sympathy of many 
High Tories, and of all who wept for the fugitives and exiles. It inspired two 
great risings-'the Fifteen' (1715), which saw the Jacobite armies march as far 
south as Lancashire, and the 'Forty-Five' (1745), which saw them reach Derby. 

This latter occasion inspired the ultimate campaign to destroy the civilization 
of the Scottish Highlands. After the terrible disaster of Culloden Moor, on 16 
April 1746, when the last great charge of the clansmen was cut down by the 
volleys of redcoat English and Lowland Scots, the life of the clans was 


suppressed forever. Their Gaelic language was proscribed, their native dress 
forbidden, their organizations banned, their leaders banished. The terrible 
Clearances, which allowed loyalist landowners to expel the inhabitants in favour 
of sheep, left more Gaels in North America than in Scotland. They gave the 
Highlands that haunting emptiness which unknowing tourists have admired ever 
since, [philibeg] 

Combined with the enclosure movement, which had been driving 
smallholders from the land in England for two centuries or more, the Clearances 
completed a purging process which was to give British society some of its most 
abiding characteristics. These purges deprived Great Britain of the peasants who 
formed the backbone of most other nations in Europe. They took away the social 
solidarity, the primitive democracy, and the sort of national consciousness which 
grows naturally from a peasant-based community. They meant that a sense of 
British nationality could only be projected downwards from the institutions of 
the state, especially from Crown and Empire, and could not grow upwards from 
the peasant family's traditional attachment to the soil. Henceforth the soil was 
largely the property of a narrow class of farmers and landowners. British society 
was divided into a well-endowed loyalist minority and a dispossessed majority, 
who would carry the half-remembered resentments of their disinheritance into 
the very bowels of the British class system. 


MASON 

On St John Baptist's Day 1717, representatives from London's four 
existing freemasons' lodges met at the Goose and Gridiron alehouse to form 
a 'Mother Grand Lodge of the World' and to elect their first Grand Master. 
Though the minutes did not survive, historians of freemasonry do not 
question that the meeting took place, or that London's Grand Lodge was 
henceforth the nerve-centre of an international movement. 1 

The earlier history of freemasonry is murky. The story of a thirteenth- 
century papal bull creating a society of church-builders is pure fiction. 
Connections with the medieval commecines or steinmetzen, still more with 
an underground association of ex-Templars, are quite unproved. A report of 
1723 contained the jingle: 




If history be no ancient Fable 
Freemasons came from the Tower of Babel. 

The earliest reliable references point to seventeenth-century Scotland, and to 
contacts with England made during the Civil War. Elias Ashmole (1617-92), 
the antiquary, astrologer, and founder of the Oxford Museum, made a note of 
his own initiation in his diary: 

1646 Oct 16, 4h 30' pm. I was made a Freemason at Warrington in 
Lancashire with Col. Henry Mainwaring of Cheshire. The names of those 
who were then of the Lodge: Mr Rich. Penket, Warden, Mr. James Collier, 
Mr. Rich, Sankey, Henry Littler, John Ellam, Richard Ellam, and Hugh 
Brew. 2 

The air of mystery surrounding freemasonry is deliberately cultivated. It 
is attractive to sympathizers, offensive to opponents. Non-initiates are left 
guessing about its rituals, its hierarchy, its pseudo-oriental jargon, its signs 
and symbols, and its purposes. The compass and square, the apron and 
gloves, and the circle on the floor are obviously designed to encourage belief 
in the movement's medieval guild origins. But it is the alleged oath of 
secrecy which has caused the greatest controversy. According to one 
account, the blindfolded initiate was asked: 

'In Whom do you put your trust?' and answered, Tn God.' 'Where are you 
travelling?' and answered 'From West to East, to the Light.' He was then 
required to promise on the Bible, not to reveal the society's secrets 'under no 
less penalty than having my throat cut across, my tongue torn out, and my 
body buried in the rough sands of the sea .. .' 3 

Freemasonry has always acted essentially as a mutual benefit society, though 
the benefits are nowhere defined. Its enemies have often maintained that it is 
anti-feminist, since it does not admit women, and antisocial as well as anti- 
Christian, since its members supposedly help each other with political, 
commercial, and social contacts to the detriment of others. Freemasons have 
always stressed their opposition to atheism, their religious tolerance, 
neutrality in politics, and commitment to charitable works. 

Freemasonry expanded dramatically in the eighteenth century. It 
recruited from the highest ranks of the British aristocracy, and became a 



lasting pillar of the monarchy. A lodge was founded in Paris in 1725 by 
expatriate Scots; thereafter it spread to every country of the Continent. It was 
established in Prague (1726), Warsaw (1755), even St Petersburg. By the 
time of the Napoleonic wars the network was sufficiently wide for stories to 
circulate about officers on opposing sides at Borodino or Waterloo giving 
each other the secret sign of recognition and holding their fire. 

In the Catholic countries, freemasonry took an anti-clerical turn and 
played an important role in the radical Enlightenment. 4 Its members were 
often deists, philosophers, critics of Church and State. In Austria, for 
example, where the papal bulls denouncing it were not published, it was 
extremely active in the promotion of the arts until its suppression in 1795. In 
France, it contributed to the pre-revolutionary ferment. In the nineteenth 
century and beyond, it would be strongly associated with the cause of 
Liberalism. 

The response of the Catholic Church was unequivocal. The Vatican 
regarded freemasonry as evil. From the Bull In Eminenti (1738) to Ab 
Apostolici (1890), the popes condemned it on six separate occasions as 
conspiratorial, wicked, and subversive. Loyal Catholics could not be 
freemasons, who were often classed in ultra-Catholic circles as a public 
enemy alongside Jacobins, Carbonari, and Jews. Totalitarian regimes of the 
twentieth century were still more hostile. Freemasons were consigned to 
concentration camps by both Fascists and Communists. In many parts of 
Europe they could only rebuild their activities after the fall of Fascism, or, in 
the East, after the collapse of the Soviet bloc. 

Controversy about the role of freemasonry continues. But the most 
impressive document about freemasonry is its membership list, which is said 
to include, Francis I of Austria, Frederick II of Prussia, Gustav IV of 
Sweden, Stanislaw-August of Poland, and Paul I of Russia; Wren, Swift, 
Voltaire, Montesquieu, Gibbon, Goethe, Burns, Wilkes, Burke; Haydn, 
Mozart, Guillotin, and Marat; Generals Lafayette, Kutuzov, Suvorov, and 
Wellington; Marshals MacDonald and Poniatowski; Talleyrand, Canning, 
Scott, Trollope, O'Connell, Pushkin, Liszt, Mazzini, Garibaldi, and Kossuth; 
Leopold I of Belgium, William I of Germany; Eiffel, Tirpitz, Scharnhorst, 
Masaryk, Kerensky, Stresemann, and Churchill; and all British kings except 
one from George IV to George VI. Which shows that the greatest of 
international secret societies was not completely secret. 



PHILIBEG 


In 1727 the chief of the Clan Macdonnell of Glengarry entered the iron¬ 
smelting business. He leased the forest of Invergarry to a Quaker 
forgemaster from Barrow in Lancashire, Thomas Rawlinson, and raised the 
workforce to cut the timber and man the furnace. Rawlinson, who visited 
regularly, noticed that the clansmen's traditional attire, the long breacon or 
'belted plaid', was hampering their labour. So, consulting the garrison tailor 
at Inverness, he designed a shorter, pleated, knee-length garment, which 
would soon be known as the felie-beg, the 'philibeg' or small kilt. In this 
way, the central item of Scotland's supposedly ancient Highland costume 
was invented by an Englishman. 1 

Soon afterwards the second Jacobite Rising was defeated; and the 
Westminster Parliament banned all Highland dress. For forty years the kilt 
could not be worn in public, except by the Highland regiments which the 
British Army was busy recruiting-the Black Watch (1739), the Highland 
Light Infantry (1777), the Seaforth Highlanders (1778), the Camerons 
(1793), the Argyll and Sutherlands and the Gordons (1794). In those same 
decades, whilst the Highland Society in London campaigned for the return of 
the kilt, male civilians in the Highlands took permanently to trousers, 

[NOMEN] 

In 1822 George IV paid the first royal visit to Edinburgh since the Union. 
Sir Walter Scott, the novelist, acted as a master of ceremonies. The Highland 
regiments, who had covered themselves in glory at Waterloo, were paraded 
in full kilted splendour. All the clan chiefs of Scotland were urged to attend 
in 'traditional costume'. They, too, wore kilts, each in a distinctive tartan. 
Chequered plaid had been woven for centuries by a thriving industry, which 
supplied the 'trews' or tapered breeches of the well-to-do. But its colourful 
'setts' or patterns had been loosely associated with regions, not with clans; 
and it had not been used by ordinary folk. The most famous of the setts, the 
black-and-green tartan of the Campbells, which would be given to the Black 
Watch, had been known in the trade as 'Kidd No. 155', after a Caribbean 
planter who ordered it for his slaves. Yet the Highland regiments and the 



gathering of 1822 combined to establish the custom of linking each sett with 
one particular clan name. They were greatly assisted by the later publication 
of a finely illustrated but spurious work, the Vestiarium Scoticum (1842), 
written by two charlatan brothers, the self-styled Sobieski-Stuarts, who held 
romantic court on the island of Eileann Aigas near Inverness. 

The allocation of tartans completed a remarkable process of cultural 
invention which had been evolving over two centuries. In the first stage, 
after the founding of the Presbyterian colony in Ulster, the obviously Irish 
origins of Highland civilization were neglected, then repudiated. A new, 
exclusively Scottish history and literature were compiled, not least by the 
brilliant fake poetry of James Macpherson's 'Ossian'. Supposedly 'ancient 
and original' Highland customs, like the kilt, proved attractive, since they 
met the demand for an unambiguous national pedigree. In the final stage, 
which started with the Act of Amnesty (1786), masses of Highland refugees 
crowded into the Lowlands, and the new traditions were adopted by Scots of 
all ilks as a mark of their non-Englishness. This highly romantic game was 
abetted by Queen Victoria, who acquired the estate of Balmoral in 1848, and 
invented a Balmoral tartan for her own very un-Scottish consort and family. 

The Macdonnells of Glengarry did not see the end of this revolution. 2 
Originally a sept or sub-clan of the Clan Macdonald of Skye, once 'Lords of 
the Isles', their Gaelic name meant 'sons of Domhnull', the 'world ruler'. 
During intervals of their feud with the Mackenzies, they had always been 
prominent in the Catholic and Jacobite cause. A Macdonnell carried the 
standard of James II at Killiecrankie in 1689, and fought again at Sheriffmuir 
in 1715. His successor fought in the Forty-Five at the head of 600 clansmen, 
and was imprisoned in the Tower of London. But the sixteenth chief sold the 
ancestral lands and emigrated to New Zealand. Their red, black, dark green, 
and white tartan has all the signs of a simple and ancient sett. Whether it 
adorned the original Scottish kilt of 1727 is not known. 

In the late nineteenth century, 'invented tradition' was mass-produced all 
over Europe. 3 When the German Socialists invented May Day (1890), when 
the Greeks restaged the Olympic Games (1896), when the Russians marked 
the founding of the Romanov Dynasty (1913), or the Scots instituted 'Burns 
Night'-the Lowlanders' answer to the kilt, the pipes, and the haggis- they 
were all seeking to endow their constituents with a common sense of 



identity. 


Within the British Isles, Ireland was a country apart. Though its fate cannot 
be compared to the harrying of the Scottish highlands, the legacy of conflict was 
deep and bitter. Both Protestants and Catholics had suffered foul persecution 
during the religious wars. After 1691 the Protestant supremacy was bolstered by 
dracon-ian penal laws which denied Catholics the right to office, property, 
education, and intermarriage. Ireland was excluded from the Union of 1707. It 
retained its own Parliament, but was still subject to the ancient 'Poyning's Law', 
which gave automatic control of legislation to the king's ministers in London. 
Unlike Scotland, Ireland was not allowed to benefit from free trade with 
England. Unlike Wales, it did not yet experience any sort of national or cultural 
revival. With the sole exception of Protestant Ulster, where Huguenot refugees 
started the prosperous linen industry, it did not participate directly in Britain's 
industrial revolution. A rising population made rural distress a fact of life. The 
famines of 1726-9 and 1739-41 foreshadowed the disaster of the 1840s. The 
ferocious 'Whiteboy' gangs first made their appearance in the countryside in 
1761. A movement for reform led by Henry Flood (1732-91) and Henry Grattan 
(1746-1820) was eventually overtaken by the abortive rebellion of Wolfe Tone 
and his United Irishmen (1798), and by Ireland's forcible incorporation into the 
United Kingdom through the second Act of Union (1801). 

Hanoverian Britain lasted for 123 years. The reigns of the four Georges-I 
(1714-27), II (1727-60), III (1760-1820), and IV (1820-30)-witnessed a truly 
constitutional monarchy presiding over the acquisition and the loss of an empire, 
over the world's first Industrial Revolution, and over the rise of unprecedented 
naval power which rendered Britain uniquely immune from the Continent's 
affairs. Such indeed were the differences between Britain and its Continental 
neighbours which arose during this period that many insular historians have been 
led to conceive of British and European history as separate subjects. 

In retrospect, the most momentous event of later Hanoverian times is to be 
found in the loss of thirteen British colonies during the so-called 'American 
Revolution' of 1776-83. Of course, no one in 1776 could possibly have foreseen 
the full potential of the USA. The thirteen colonies still looked to be very fragile 
ventures, surrounded by the uncontrolled forces of nature in a largely unexplored 
continent. Even so, the prospects for the British Empire on the eve of the War of 




Independence were enormous by any standards. British naval power had already 
raised the very real possibility that the vast western and mid-western territories 
of Spain and France in America could be absorbed without serious opposition. 
(In 1803, the French were indeed obliged to sell their 'Louisiana'-effectively, 
the whole of the mid-West-for a song.) Shorn of their most attractive 
transatlantic possessions, however, the British were increasingly constrained to 
seek their further imperial fortunes elsewhere, especially in India and Africa. 

At the time, the British government was blind to even the most immediate 
implications. John Hancock was right to sign the Declaration of Independence 
(1776) in large letters, so that King George could read it 'without his spectacles'. 
For Britain's Continental rivals, the American revolt provided an opportunity for 
short-term meddling. France and Spain assisted a cause which they would never 
have tolerated among their own colonists. Yet for all Europeans of conscience it 
raised issues of fundamental political principle, challenging the very foundations 
of the monarchies by which almost all of them were ruled. The seven articles of 
the Constitution to which it gave rise contain the clearest and most practical 
formulations of the ideals of the Enlightenment. They are short, secular, 
democratic, republican, rational; firmly grounded in the contract theory of 
Locke, in English legalism, in Montesquieu's thoughts on the division of powers, 
in Rousseau's concept of the general will. The Constitution was written in the 
name of'We, the people of the United States', and has proved remarkably 
durable. Its irony lies in the fact that many of its leading authors, including 
Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, were slave-owners, and that it was 
wrested from a country which was one of the most free and best-governed of the 
day. 

Prior to the eighteenth century, Savoy had been a frontier province of the Holy 
Roman Empire. It straddled the ridge of the western Alps between the kingdom 
of France and the plain of Lombardy. Its ruling house, which claimed to be 
Europe's oldest ruling dynasty, was descended from the eleventh-century Count 
Umberto Biancamano, 'Humbert of the White Hand', whose family secured 
possession of territory on either versant of the Mont Cenis and the Grand St 
Bernard passes. Its western region-the francophone county of Savoy, including 
Chambery, Annecy, and the massif of Mont Blanc-reached to the shore of Lake 
Geneva. Its eastern region, the Italian-speaking principality of Piedmont, 
including Aosta, Susa, and Turin, extended as far as the Ligurian riviera. After 
the rise of the Swiss Confederation the province was cut off from the main body 



of the Empire, and its rulers in Turin, when raised to the status of imperial dukes, 
were able to pursue a virtually independent existence. Like his predecessors, 
Duke Victor Amadeus II (r. 1675-1730) trod a delicate path between his 
powerful French and Habsburg neighbours. However, by deserting his alliance 
with Louis XIV at a critical point of the War of the Spanish Succession, he was 
rewarded by the Emperor with royal status, and the island of Sicily to boot. In 
1720 he was obliged by the Austrians to exchange Sicily for the island of 
Sardinia, thereby ending his reign on the throne of a composite 'Kingdom of 
Sardinia' made up of Savoy, Piedmont, and Sardinia itself. This strange 
conglomerate, an archetypal product of dynastic politics, a 'Prussia of the south', 
was to turn a century later into the unlikely leader of the movement for Italian 
unification (see Chapter X). 

Spain headed the long procession of countries which were fast losing their 
former political and economic standing. Under the Bourbon kings-Philip V (r. 
1700-46), Ferdinand VI (r. 1746-59), Charles III (r. 1759-88), and Charles IV 
(r. 1788-1808)-it lost all pretensions to be a great power. Stripped of its 
Continental possessions except for Parma and Piacenza, and tied to a vast 
American empire of doubtful value, it stayed under the domination of the 
grandees, the Church, and the Inquisition. In Philip's reign alone, 700 autos-da- 
fe were staged. Some success was achieved in reorganizing the administration on 
French lines, in embellishing Madrid, and in encouraging cultural life through 
the Academy (1713). [baserria] [prado] 

Portugal likewise vegetated under the rule of indifferent monarchs and a 
militant Church. John V (r. 1706-50), known as 'The Faithful', was a priest- 
king, 'one of whose sons by an abbess became Inquisitor-General'. The reign of 
his successor, Joseph I (r. 1750-77), was shattered by the Lisbon earthquake, and 
restored by the energetic but short-lived reforms of Portugal's latter-day Colbert, 
Sebastao, Marquis of Pombal (1699-1782). Pombal probably never uttered the 
words most frequently attributed to him-'Bury the dead, and feed the living'- 
but from 1750 he dominated the country for a quarter of a century, reorganizing 
finance, education, navy, commerce, and colonies. Maria I (r. 1777-1816), like 
her British contemporary, lapsed into insanity, and Portugal, like Britain, was to 
pass the whole of the revolutionary period under a regency, [quake] 



BASERRIA 


1 hat the baserria or 'communal farmstead' formed the basis of a unique 
type of social organization in the Basque country is confirmed by the census 
records of Navarre from 1786. To overcome the succession crises which 
often beset the single peasant household [grillenstein], the Diet of Navarre 
had confirmed the right of each farmstead to be run by two coresident 
managerial couples. All the adult members of a farmstead, whether owners 
or tenants, were empowered to elect an heir or heiress in each generation 
who would succeed as soon as one of the managerial couples was disabled 
by death or retirement. The marriages and dowries of the managers and their 
offspring were also subject to communal approval. As a result, the baserria 
was r-markably stable in terms of ownership and management, as well as 
being economically self-sufficient. It was the 'true repository of Basque 
culture' in the face of growing urbanization and industrialization, the 
bedrock of the Basques' separate identity until the onset of rural 
depopulation in recent times. Culture, economy, and social organization 
were inseparable in a system which preserved one of Europe's oldest pre- 
Indo-European peoples through many centuries. 1 


Eighteenth-century Italy was still divided, even if the lines of division were 
somewhat altered. The main rivalry now lay between the House of Savoy in 
Turin, the Austrian Habsburgs, holding Milan, and the Duchy of Tuscany. The 
re-establishment in 1738 of an independent Bourbon kingdom in Naples added 
some balance. All these territories benefited from the sound management of 
enlightened despots. Elsewhere, the old contrasts prevailed between the city 
republics such as Venice and the divine autocracy of the Papal States. The 
Vatican lost much of its room for political manoeuvre when the Catholic powers 
were disunited in everything except their demand to suppress the Jesuits (see pp. 
593-4). Three long papacies, those of Clement XI (1700-21), Benedict XTV 
(1740-58), and Pius VI (1775-99), could not check the Vatican's political 
effacement. Secular culture saw a marked revival; Italian language and literature 
were promoted by official academies in Florence and Rome. Science and 
scholarship flourished. Names such as that of L. A. Muratori the archivist 
(1672-1750) at Ferrara, Antonio Genovesi the economist (1712-69) at Naples, 




Cesare Beccaria the criminologist (1738-94) at Milan, or Alessandro Volta the 
physicist (1745-1821) at Pavia gained continental fame. They undoubtedly 
strengthened the bonds of a growing national cultural community, [tormenta] 


QUAKE 

On 1 November 1755 the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, was wrecked by an 
earthquake. A tidal wave destroyed the quays and ships in the Tagus. Two- 
thirds of the city's buildings were razed or burned. Between 30,000 and 
40,000 citizens' lost their lives. The shocks were felt from Scotland to 
Constantinople. 

The Lisbon earthquake was neither the first nor the last of Europe's 
disasters. Similar devastation had occurred in 1421, when the collapse of the 
Maas Polder drowned hundreds of low-lying villages in Holland, in 
December 1631, when an eruption of Mt Vesuvius killed some 18,000 
people in Italy, or in 1669, when lava from Mt Etna buried the port of 
Catania in Sicily. The earthquake of 1356 wrecked Basle, whilst that of 28 
December 1908 levelled both Messina and Reggio di Calabria, with a loss of 
77,000. London's Great Fire (1666) had many counterparts. Visitations of 

plague and cholera did not cease until the end of the nineteenth century, 
[SANITAS] 

Yet the quake of 1755 caused more than physical damage. It rocked the 
most cherished hopes of the Enlightenment. It shook the belief of the 
philosophes in an ordered, predictable world and in a benign, rational God. It 
brought ruin to just and unjust alike. As Voltaire himself was forced to 
admit: 'After all, the world does contain evil.' 1 


The United Provinces, like Portugal once a jewel in the Spanish crown, were still 
left with an overseas empire but with little influence over events nearer to home. 
At sea they had lost their maritime pre-eminence to the British; on land they 
were surrounded on all sides by the Habsburgs. The long-standing tug-of-war 
between the republican oligarchy and the House of Orange continued until 1815, 
when a hereditary monarchy was finally created, [batavia] 






Eighteenth-century Scandinavia entered centre-stage on only one occasion. 
Sweden's last throw for greatness under Charles XII (r. 1697-17) was an 
anachronism which ended in disaster (see below). With that exception, the 
Scandinavian countries settled down to an existence of inoffensive obscurity. In 
Denmark-Norway the four Oldenburg kings-Frederick IV (r. 1699-1730), 
Christian VI (r. 1730-46), Frederick V (r. 1746-66), and Christian VII (r. 1766- 
1808)-went some way to modernizing the country on enlightened lines. A 
zealous experiment in this direction, with 2,000 decrees passed in two years, 
ended abruptly in 1772 when the King's chief minister, J. F. Struensee, a 
Prussian, and presumed father of the Queen's child, was beheaded for lese- 
majeste. In Sweden a long and strong reaction against royal absolutism gave 
prominence to a Diet whose stormy proceedings were given over to the laborious 
workings of its four estates, and the rivalry of the factions of 'Hats' and 'Caps'. 
The monarchy was greatly weakened by the abdication of Charles XII's sister, 
Ulrica Feonora, in favour of her hapless German husband, Frederick I (r. 1720- 
51), and in 1756 by the Prussian-inspired intrigues of his successor, Adolphus 
Frederick (r. 1751-71) of Holstein-Gottorp-Eutin. Its successful reassertion after 
the royal coup d'etat of 1772 under Gustavus III (r. 1771-92) brought Sweden 
closer to the mainstream of contemporary politics and culture. This patriotic and 
accomplished young king, who had once stormed the salons of Paris, was to be 
assassinated in 1792 whilst trying to organize a league of princes against the 
French Revolution, [eldluft] 

Whilst Western Europe was preoccupied with the supremacy of France, the 
countries of Central and Eastern Europe had major preoccupations of their own. 
Within the lifetime of Fouis XIV, Central Europe experienced two unexpected 
developments which seriously affected the history of the German states. One 
was the last great surge of the Ottomans, who in 1683 returned to the siege of 
Vienna. The other was provided by a further dramatic stage in the rise of Prussia, 
whose ambitions now stood to disrupt the entire region. Eastern Europe 
witnessed the decisive stage in the emergence of the Russian Empire, henceforth 
a military and political power of the first rank. Trapped in the middle of these 
rapid shifts, the old Republic of Poland-Eithuania first rallied to the rescue of 
Vienna, then slowly sank beneath the blows of her rapacious neighbours. Before 
the eighteenth century was out, the traditional power structure of Central and 
Eastern Europe had been transformed out of all recognition. 

The Ottoman surge of the late seventeenth century was associated with an 



extended political crisis, which for thirty years put the grand viziership in the 
hands of the Kopriiltis, a family of Albanian origin. It began in the 1650s amidst 
recriminations over Crete and the Venetian blockade of the Dardanelles, and was 
fuelled after 1660 by a disputed succession in Transylvania which placed the 
Porte in direct opposition to the Habsburgs. The Kopriilus saw war as a means 
for diverting the intrigues and resentments of the army, especially the corps of 
janissaries, against whom they had taken such drastic disciplinary measures. In 
1672 they attacked the Polish province of Podolia, seizing the fortress of 
Kamieniets on the Dniester, until checked at Chocim by the Crown Hetman, 
John Sobieski. In 1681-2, in Hungary, they took the side of rebels led by Count 
Tokoli and, after declaring Hungary to be an Ottoman vassal, advanced up the 
Danube towards Vienna. 

The Siege of Vienna lasted for two months, from July to September 1683. It 
saw the poorly provisioned Austrian capital invested by a powerful army of 
200,000 men equipped with a large siege train of heavy artillery. At a juncture 
when the German princes were fixated by the encroachments of Louis XIV on 
the Rhine, the Emperor had great difficulty responding to the danger on the 
Danube. As it was, the most effective assistance came from Poland, where 
Sobieski, now King and weaned from his early alliance with France, saw a 
Turkish war and Austrian subsidies as a solution to his own domestic problems. 
Having taken command of the relief force in early September, he prayed in the 
chapel on the heights of the Kahlenberg in the Vienna Woods. Then, in the mid¬ 
afternoon of the 12th, he ordered the attack: his winged hussars charged down 
the hill and rode straight for the centre of the Ottoman camp. At half-past five he 
was galloping through the enemy ranks amid scenes of panic, confusion, and 
slaughter. The following evening, he found time to write to his wife, Queen 
Marie-Louise, from the Grand Vizier's tent: 


ELDLUFT 

In 1773 the Swedish pharmacist Karl Scheele (1742-86) discovered that air 
was a mixture of 'several airs', and that one of its components, which he 
called eldluft or Tire air', held the secret of combustion. 1 In October of the 
following year, he sent his findings to Antoine Laurent Lavoisier (1743-94), 




the director of France's gunpowder and saltpetre monopoly. That same 
month Lavoisier gave lunch to the English dissenter and experimenter 
Joseph Priestley (1733-1804), and heard from him too how 'dephlo- 
gisticated air' caused lighted tapers to burn with incandescent flame. 

Lavoisier, who directed the King's Ferme Generate or tax-farming 
system as well as the Regie de Poudre, had the time and money to indulge 
his passion for experimentation. He had already noticed that many 
substances gained weight when burned, and he knew that this effect was not 
compatible with the reigning theory of Phlogiston-an invisible (and 
imaginary) form of matter which most scientists, including Priestley, still 
believed in. 

So Lavoisier designed an experiment which would measure the amount 
of Tire air' that might be absorbed when quicksilver was burned in a closed 
flask. 2 He found not only that the heated quicksilver combined with fire air 
but also that further heating separated out the new compound into its 
component parts. Modern chemical notation would have described 
Lavoisier's experiment thus: 

Hg + O = HgO (Mercuric oxide): HgO = Hg+O 

Science had finally reached an understanding of the nature of chemical 
reactions, namely that substances could be coupled and uncoupled with 
others in a material world made up of simple elements and their compounds. 

Lavoisier then addressed the task of giving simple names to the simple 
elements and compound names to compounds. Scheele's Tire air', or 
Priestley's 'Dephlogisticated air', became oxygene, Scheele's Toul air', 
hydrogene. The compound of mercury and oxygen became 'mercuric oxide'. 
In 1787 Lavoisier helped publish a list of 33 elements with their new 
nomenclature. In 1789, he published his Traite preliminaire de la Chimie, 
the world's first chemical textbook. 

Scheele was already dead, in all probability poisoned by the fumes of his 
own furnace. In 1791 Priestley was burned out of house and home by the 
Birmingham mob, for having welcomed the French Revolution. He fled to 
the USA. On 8 May 1794 Lavoisier met his death on the guillotine in the 
company of twenty-six other royal tax-farmers. The appeal judge was said to 
have remarked, 'The Republic has no need of savants.' The Chemical 



Revolution coincided almost exactly with its political counterpart. Both of 
them 'consumed their own children'. 


Only solace of my heart and soul, my fairest, most beloved Marysienka! 

Our Lord and God, Blessed of all ages, has brought unheard victory and glory to our nation. All the 
guns, the whole camp, untold spoils have fallen into our hands... There is enough powder and ammunition 
alone for a million men... The Vizir took such hurried flight that he had time to escape with only one 
horse... [The camp is] as extensive as the cities of Warsaw or of Lwow within their walls ... I have all the 
tents, and cars, et mille autres galanteries fort jolies et fort riches, mais fort riches.... They abandoned their 
janissaries in the trenches, who were put to the sword during the night... They left behind a mass of 
innocent Austrian people, particularly women; but they butchered as many as they could... The Vizir had a 
marvellously beautiful ostrich ... but this too he had killed... He had baths; he had gardens and fountains; 
rabbits and cats, and a parrot which kept flying about so that we could not catch it.. .- 

When Sobieski posted the green standard of the Prophet to the Pope, he 
appended Charles V's comment after Miihlberg: 'Veni, vidi, Deus Vicit' (I came, 
I saw, God conquered). 

The Ottoman retreat which began that day at Vienna continued by stages for 
the next 200 years. In the short term it inspired the leaders of the Holy League, 
organized by the Pope, to press on down the Danube into lands undisputed since 
crusading times. By the Peace of Carlowitz (1699) Hungary was returned to 
Austria, Podolia to Poland, Azov to Muscovy, and the Morea to Venice. In the 
long term it trapped the Ottomans' European provinces between a concerted 
pincer movement, with the Habsburgs holding the line of their Military Frontier 
on the western flank and the Russians advancing relentlessly round the Black 
Sea on the eastern flank. In this regard the Austro-Russian treaty signed in 1726 
played a long-standing strategic role (see Appendix III, p. 1284). 

The fortunes of the Ottoman wars swung back and forth. In 1739 Austria was 
made to disgorge all the gains, including Belgrade, achieved at the earlier Treaty 
of Passarowitz (1718). But three extended Russo-Turkish Wars-in 1735-9, 
1768-74, and 1787-92-left the entire northern coast of the Black Sea in 
Russian hands. The decisive Treaty of Kiiciik-Kainardji (1774) gave the Tsar a 
protectorate over all the Sultan's Christian subjects, and commercial rights in the 
Ottoman Empire previously enjoyed only by the French. It marked the onset of 
the 'Eastern Question'. Much of the Balkans, however, remained under Ottoman 
mle. The eighteenth century was a period of slowly rising national expectations, 
often among people whose first instinct was to support the Ottoman authorities. 





Greece was brought into the political arena partly through a growing degree 
of autonomy, partly through Russian intervention. A class of Greek officials 
grew up, together with Greek schools to educate them. The tribute of children 
(the dev§irme) fell into abeyance after 1676. Greek society became more 
consciously Greek. The Venetian presence in Corfu and, from 1699, in the 
Morea strengthened links with the West. In 1769 a Russian fleet sent to the 
Mediterranean against the Ottomans promised deliverance to Greece. The 
extension of Russian commercial privileges to Greek merchants was an 
important step. 

Serbia was affected by similar developments. The battles over Belgrade, and 
the Austrian occupation of 1711-18, when many Serb volunteers flocked to the 
Habsburg colours, showed that the Ottomans were not invincible. Serbia's 
Orthodox links with Russia were even closer than Greece's. The activities of 
'Karadorde' or 'Black George' Petrovic (1767-1817), who served both with 
Turkish brigands and with a Habsburg regiment, culminated in the rising of 
1804-13 that was to bring the first taste of independence. A second rising in 
1815-17 under Karadorde's assassin, Milos Obrenovic (1780-1860), was to 
pave the way for international recognition. 

The two Romanian principalities, Moldavia and Wallachia, were ruled by the 
Porte through the medium of Phanariot Greeks-so-called from the Greek 
quarter of Phanar in Constantinople. The Phanariot regime, though corrupt and 
exploitative, encouraged immigration and Western cultural contacts. The 
Austrian seizure of Bukovina (1774) and still more the Russian occupations of 
1769-74 and 1806-12 were catalysts of change. The notion of liberation from 
the Ottomans first gained ground among the dominant Greek minority. 

Bulgaria suffered greatly from the passage of Ottoman armies, and from 
bands of deserters, known as Krajlis, who ravaged the countryside for decades. 
In 1794, one of the Krajli leaders, Pasvanoilu, established himself at Vidin on the 
Danube in a virtually independent robber republic. Like the Serbs, the Christian 
Bulgars looked increasingly towards Russia. 

Albania fell into the hands of local tribal chieftains. One such chief, 
Mehemet of Bushat, founded a dynasty c.1760, which ruled upper Albania from 
Scutari for several generations. Another, Ali Pasha of Tepelen, carved out a 

fiefdom centred on Joanina, which stretched from the Adriatic to the Aegean, 
[SHQIPERIA] 

Crna Gora, which was known to the outside world by its Venetian name of 



'Montenegro', was the only part of the Balkans to escape Ottoman rule. 
According to legend, when God created the earth a lot of rocks were left over; so 
He made Montenegro. Though the Turks occupied the capital, Cetinje, for short 
periods, they never held onto it. 'A small army is beaten', they said, 'and a large 
army dies of starvation.' From 1516 to 1696 Montenegro had been a theocratic 
state, ruled by monkish bishops. From 1696 until 1918 it was ruled by hereditary 
princes of the Petrovic dynasty. 

By the late eighteenth century, when the Balkan elites first began to dream 
about independence, they had been living under Ottoman rule for four to five 
centuries. The experience had left its mark. The Orthodox Church had made its 
accommodation long since, instilling in its subjects profoundly conservative and 
anti-Western attitudes. From the time of the Crusades, the Orthodox looked on 
the West as the source of a subjugation worse than that of the infidel. As a result, 
none of the great civilizing movements that shook the Western world- 
Renaissance, Reformation, Science, Enlightenment, Romanticism-could 
effectively penetrate the Balkan countries. Political traditions owed little to 
rationalism, absolutism, or constitutionalism; kinship politics dominated at all 
levels; nepotism lubricated by bribery was a way of life. 'Power is a trough,' ran 
the Turkish proverb, 'and he who does not feed is a pig.' The border of the 
shrinking enclave of what came to be called 'Turkey-in-Europe' formed one of 
Europe's most deep-seated cultural fault-lines. 


SHQIPERIA 

Albania (Shqiperia , 'Land of the Eagles') can fairly claim to be the least, 
familiar of all European states. Sailing down the coast in the 1780s, Edward 
Gibbon wrote of 'a country within sight of Italy which is less known than the 
interior of America'. Yet no country has suffered more from the whims of 
international politics. 

The insurrection of 1911, which was to free Albania from Ottoman rule, 
accelerated the creation of the Balkan League made up of Albania's 
Christian neighbours. All the League's members, except Bulgaria, possessed 
territories containing important Albanian populations; and none was 
prepared to see a 'Greater Albania' in which all Albanians would have been 




united. The Treaty of London (May 1913), which ended the War of the 
Balkan League, recognized Albanian sovereignty. But it insisted on the 
delimitation of frontiers by an international commission, and the 
introduction of a Western-style monarchy. (See Appendix III, p. 1310.) 

Albanian society was deeply divided both by social structure and by 
religion. The highland clans of the north, the Gheg, who lived by the law of 
the blood feud, had little in common with the lowlanders, or Tosk, of the 
south. Two-thirds of the inhabitants were Muslim. The remaining third was 
equally divided between Catholics and Orthodox. Important minorities 
included the Vlach-speaking pastoralists of the east, Italians in the coastal 
cities, and Greeks, who were accustomed to regard southern Albania as 
'northern Epirus', [gagauz] 

During the First World War Albania was invaded both by Serbia and by 
Greece. By the second Treaty of London (1915), with Italy, the Allied 
powers secretly promised to turn Albania into an Italian protectorate. The 
Albanian monarchy suffered a chequered fate. The first Mpret or King, 
Wilhelm von Wied (r. 1914) landed in March and fled in September. After 
the War, General Ahmet Zogu was established as State President of an 
Albanian Republic, only to have himself proclaimed King in 1926. 

During the Second World War, Mussolini established the Italian 
protectorate promised a quarter of a century earlier. Albanian territory was 
extended to include the district of Kossovo; and Victor Emmanuel X was 
declared King. There was a brief German occupation in 1944-5. 

The Albanian People's Republic was set up in 1946 by a group of 
communist Tosk partisans, who had gained wartime ascendancy thanks to 
Western support. Their leader, Enver Hodzha, resigned all interest in the 
Albanians living in Montenegro, Kossovo, and Macedonia, retreating into 
almost total isolation behind the pre-war frontiers. Two hundred years after 
Gibbon, tourists in the Adriatic were still sailing or flying past Albania with 
the same feelings of wonder and incomprehension. 1 


Once the Ottoman threat was repulsed, the fortunes of the Habsburgs revived. 
Leopold I (r. 1658-1705) did not live to see the humbling of Louis XTV; but his 
sons, Joseph I (r. 1705-11) and Charles VI (r. 1711-40), succeeded to an 




inheritance greatly enlarged in Hungary, Italy, and the Netherlands. The principal 
political crisis arose once again from a problem of succession, which caused the 
outbreak of a major Continental war. Charles VI, like the Spanish namesake 
whom he had once nominally succeeded, had no male heir. A narrow-minded 
bigot, he devoted much of his life to enforcing religious conformity and, by the 
Pragmatic Sanction, to ensuring the succession of his daughter, Maria Theresa. 
In the event, the imperial throne was seized on his death by Charles Albert, 
Elector of Bavaria, who as Charles VII (r. 1742-5) briefly reigned with French 
collusion as the only non-Habsburg emperor in 400 years. It then reverted to 
Maria Theresa's husband, Francis I (r. 1745-65), Grand Duke of Tuscany, and 
their elder son, Joseph II (r. 1765-90). In effect, in her various capacities as 
Empress-consort, Emperor's mother, or Queen of Bohemia and Hungary, Maria 
Theresa (1717-80) held sway in Vienna for 40 years. She was a woman of 
conscience and restraint, devoted among other matters to agrarian reform and the 
relief of the serf-peasantry. Joseph II, in contrast, was an impatient radical, 'a 
crowned revolutionary', a convinced anticlerical and opponent of noble 
privilege. Jozefism-the name given to his policy of asserting state power 
against the traditional pillars of Church and nobility-was one of the more 
thorough variants of enlightened despotism. 

In this period, Austria developed a bureaucratic system that is sometimes 
called cameralism, that is, a system based on an elite caste of professional office¬ 
holders. Together with an expanded and reorganized military system, it provided 
the cement which was to keep the Habsburg monarchy going long after the 
demise of the Empire in Germany. The University of Vienna possessed a special 
faculty for the training of such civil servants, who passed straight into the higher 
echelons of finance, justice, and education. (The University of Halle did the 
same for Prussia.) These highly educated, well-paid, German-speaking and 
loyalist bureaucrats were entirely dependent on the monarch's favour. They 
formed a solid buffer against the divergent interests of the nobility, the Church, 
and the nationalities, and led the drive for disinterested rationalization and 
reform. 

In this (as it proved) its terminal phase, the cohesion of the Holy Roman 
Empire was greatly undermined by the separate dynastic policies of its leading 
princes. Just as the Habsburg emperors could rely on their lands and possessions 
beyond the Empire, so increasingly could the Electors. From 1697 to 1763 the 
Wettins, Electors of Saxony, ruled as kings of Poland-Lithuania (see below). 
From 1701 the Hohenzollerns, Electors of Brandenburg, ruled as kings in Prussia 



(see below). From 1714 the Electors of Hanover ruled as kings of Great Britain 
(see above). Throughout the century the Wittelsbach Electors of Bavaria sought 
to enlarge their fortunes through their traditional alliance with France. Because 
of their varied connections, all the 'capital cities' of 'Germany'-Vienna, 
Dresden, Berlin, Hanover, and Munich-assumed very different flavours. The 
last two emperors-Leopold II (r. 1790-2), Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Francis 
II (r. 1792-1806)-had little chance of saving their Empire from the 
revolutionary deluge which destroyed it. [freude] 

Hungary, liberated from the Turks, fell victim to the despotic designs of its 
Habsburg liberators. In 1687 the 700-year-old elective monarchy was abolished. 
Hereditary Habsburg rulers turned the noble Diets into mere registers of royal 
decrees. The ancient 'right of resistance' of the Magyar nobles was eliminated. 
From 1704 to 1711 a widespread rebellion under Francis Rakoczi II succeeded in 
exploiting the Habsburgs' preoccupations with Spain and with the Turks. Many 
of the ancient liberties were restored first by the Peace of Szatmar (1711) and 
later as the Magyars' price for acceding to the Pragmatic Sanction. Here were the 
basic laws which prevailed until 1848. Hungary escaped the fate of neighbouring 
Bohemia. Still, the compromise was not an easy one. Maria Theresa ruled after 
1764 without recourse to the Hungarian Diet; whilst Joseph II rode roughshod 
over all the constitutional formalities, omitting even to be crowned. In 1784, 
treating Austria and Hungary as one united state, he introduced German as the 
official language. The storms of protest were defused by Leopold II, who in 
1791 reconfirmed Hungary's separate status, together with the use of Latin and 
Magyar. The deep conservatism of Hungarian life, centred on the patronage of 
the magnates and the dietines of the counties, was strengthened by the repeated 
Turkish wars and by the ethnic and religious divisions. It may well have been 
prolonged by Maria Theresa's agrarian reforms which, in the so-called Urbarium 
of 1767, ended the peasants' adscription to the land and reduced their 
revolutionary temper. Her educational reforms, together with the founding of the 
University of Buda and the Magyar literary revival at the turn of the century, laid 
the seeds of modern national consciousness. In due course, the groundswell of 
Magyar nationalism was to awaken corresponding reactions among the Slovak, 
Croat, and Jewish minorities. 

The rise of Pmssia reached its critical momentum in the eighteenth century. It is 
generally interpreted in the light of Prussia's later mission of unification in 
Germany. In reality, it occurred through the relendess pursuit of dynastic 



policies, which repeatedly divided the German world and which raised a 
kingdom possessing none of the characteristics of a latent national state. It was 
achieved through the creation of an administrative machine of marvellous 
efficiency, which enabled its rulers to maintain a standing army of 
disproportionate size. (In terms of the ratio between professional soldiers and 
population, Prussia was thirty times more efficient than its neighbour, Poland- 
Lithuania.) The Prussian Excise (1680) made possible the upkeep of the Prussian 
army. The army was based on an aristocratic officer corps, and after 1733 on the 
cantonal system of peasant conscription, [goose-step] 

Under Frederick III (r. 1688-1713) and Frederick-William I (r. 1713-40), the 
'drill-master of Europe', the Hohenzollerns followed the same unscrupulous path 
laid down by the 'Great Elector' (see Chapter VII). In 1700 their electoral vote 
was sold to the Habsburgs in return for recognition of their own claim to 
kingship. In 1728 their accession to the Pragmatic Sanction was bought by the 
cession of Berg and Ravenstein. Fleet footwork in the alliances of the Spanish 
Succession and the Great Northern War resulted in the important acquisitions of 
Stettin and Western Pomerania. Sweden was only the latest to learn that it was 
no less dangerous having Prussia as an ally than as an enemy. The inimitable 
'Prussian spirit' grew from a mixture of loyalty to the dynasty, of arrogance born 
of military prowess, and of justified pride in cultural and educational advances. 
Halle received the first Prussian university in 1694; Berlin, invigorated by a 
major influx of French Huguenots and Austrian Protestants, received its Royal 
Academy of Arts (1696) and its Royal Academy of Sciences (1700). An edict of 
1717 looked to the improvement of public education. 

Under Frederick the Great (r. 1740-86) Prussia unleashed the forces so 
carefully garnered by his predecessors. From Frederick's opening sensation, the 
seizure of Austrian Silesia in 1740, war was the prime instrument of policy for a 
quarter of a century. Then, having brought his country to the brink of 
annihilation, Frederick turned to diplomatic brigandage, which in the first 
Partition of Poland finally brought the prize of a consolidated territorial base (see 
below), [GROSSENMEER] 

Frederick's personality was one of the wonders of the age. It was formed 
under the lash of a brutal father, who had forced him in boyhood to watch the 
execution of his friend, Katte, and had imprisoned him for years in the fortress of 
Kiistrin (Kostrzyn) on the Oder. Throughout the reign, the crash of cannon and 
the groans of the battlefield were mixed with the flights of the King's flute and 



the chatter of the philosophes. 'I was born too soon/ Frederick once said, 'but I 
have seen Voltaire/ German historians have not been alone in praising his 
merits. Lord Acton called him 'the most consummate practical genius' that ever 
inherited a modern throne. 

The wars and battles of Frederick the Great fill many volumes. They are 
among classics of historic warfare. After the two Silesian wars, 1740-2 and 
1744-5, which formed part of the wider War of Austrian Succession and earned 
him the undying hatred of Maria Theresa, he retained the fruits of his aggression. 
At Mollwitz, Chotusitz, Hohenfriedberg, Frederick carried the day. In 1745 he 
occupied Prague. In the Seven Years War he reached the heights of glory and the 
depths of despair. It began with his attack on Saxony. Through Lobositz, 
Rossbach, Zorndorf, Leuthen, Kolin, Kunersdorf, Liegnitz, and Torgau, he 
brilliantly exploited his interior lines of communication, and repeatedly evaded 
his enemies' attempts to bring their overwhelming numbers to bear. At 
Rossbach, he triumphed with trifling losses. At Kunersdorf, he survived amidst 
scenes of carnage. In 1762, with the treasury empty, British subsidies stopped, 
and the Russians poised to take Berlin, he was saved by the death of the Russian 
Empress and an unexpected truce. Once again, at the Treaty of Hubertusburg 
(1763), he kept his winnings intact. 'Hunde,' he had once railed, when his guards 
had hesitated, 'wollt ihr ewig leben?' (dogs, do you wish to live forever?). 

Under Frederick-William II (r. 1786-97) Prussia began to take a different 
course. The new King even risked an alliance with Poland-Lithuania. But the 
logic of the revolutionary era and of Russian power brought him back into line. 
At the second and the third Partitions of Poland, Prussia acquired both Danzig 
and Warsaw. By 1795 Berlin found itself ruling over a country that was 40 per 
cent Slav and Catholic, with a large Jewish community. It was one of the most 
dynamic melting-pots of Europe. Had this situation developed without 
interruption, it is hard to imagine what course German and Central European 
history might eventually have taken. As it was, old Prussia was to be 
overwhelmed by Napoleon; and the new Prussia which appeared in 1815 was to 
be a very different beast indeed. 

If Prussia exemplified the successful pursuit of power in a small country, Russia 
exemplified a similar phenomenon on a heroic scale in Europe's largest country. 
Frederick the Great himself was impressed. Of the Russians, he once remarked: 
'It will need the whole of Europe to keep those gentlemen within bounds.' 



In the 149 years which separated the deaths of Alexei Mikhailovitch in 1676 
and of Alexander I in 1825, the Romanovs raised the fortunes of their country 
from that of a nascent regional power to that of the invincible 'gendarme of 
Europe'. Alexei, who had succeeded in the same decade as Louis XIV, was an 
obscure Muscovite prince of whom, at Versailles, little was even known; 
Alexander rode through Paris in triumph. During the intervening century and a 
half, scores of military campaigns were fought, largely with success; the Grand 
Duchy of Moscow was revamped as the 'Empire of all the Russias'; the territory 
of the state engulfed a string of neighbouring countries; society and 
administration were subjected to root-and-branch reforms; the whole identity of 
the state and ruling nation was remodelled. For all who revelled in this 
exhibition of power, all the people and policies who made the transformation 
possible were by definition good and, as Klyuchevsky wrote of Peter the Great, 
'necessary'. 

In autocracies the personality of the autocrat is no secondary factor, and in 
Russia two personalities stood out-those of Peter I (r. 1682-1725) and of 
Catherine II (r. 1762-96). Both were awarded the epithet of 'Great'; both were 
larger than life, in physical stature, animal energy, and determination; and both 
have been eulogized for their undoubted contribution to Russia's own greatness. 
In any overall judgement, however, whether about the ruler or the realm, one 
must wonder if size and brute strength alone can be taken as the test of greatness. 
Critics find no difficulty in finding traits that provoke shame rather than respect. 
Peter, in particular, was a moral monster. His lifelong participation in the 
debaucheries of the Sobor of Fools and Jesters-an obscene and blasphemous 
Russian variant of the English Hell-fire Club-may conceivably be dismissed as 
eccentric bad taste. But his personal involvement in gross and sadistic tortures, 
first revealed during the mass maltreatment of the rebel streltsyin 1697, cannot 
be counted a foible, even by the standards of his own day. His quaint delight in 
model ships and tin soldiers must be contrasted with his colossal disregard for 
the immense human suffering which attended many of his projects-such as the 
building of St Petersburg. A Tsar who could watch his innocent son and heir 
racked to death in the afternoon before attending a ribald court party in the 
evening was not far from Nero, even if he did change Russia 'from non-being 
into being'. 



GROSSENMEER 


In 1785 Grossenmeer was a village in the Duchy of Oldenburg in northwest 
Germany, close to the border of the Netherlands and the newly acquired 
Prussian province of East Friesland. At that time it had a total population of 
885, made up from 142 households, plus some 77 'paupers' or other casual 
residents. An analysis of the village's households reveals the following 


categories: 

Household type No. % 

1 Solitaries (e.g. widows) 2 1.4 

2. Non-conjugal household (co-resident siblings) 1 0.7 

3 Single-family households (parents and children) 97 68.3 

4. Extended family units (several generations and relatives) 28 19.7 

5. Multiple-family households (2 or more conjugal units co-resident) 14 9.9 

Total 142 100 


From this, it is evident that single-family households formed a clear majority 
(68 per cent), although extended and multiple-family households constituted 
a strong minority (30 per cent). 

A senior scholar in the field chose this example to typify 'that ill-defined 
European area where households tended to have the characteristics we have 
called 'middle'. A 'Four-Region Hypothesis' was built on isolated examples 
of that sort. If Grossenmeer (1785) typified Europe's 'West-Central' or 
'Middle' region, the Essex village of Elmdon (1861) was taken to typify 'the 
West', Fagagna (1870), near Bologna, 'the Mediterranean', and Krasnoe 
Sobakino (1849), in Russia, 'the East'. The geography is as suspect as the 
generalizing is grandiose. 

The hypothesis was presented as the refinement of an older scheme, 
taken to be 'universally accepted', which had presumed to divide the 
traditional European family into two still simpler types-'West' and 'East'. 
Grossenmeer was taken to be a variation on Elmdon, where no less than 73 
per cent of households conformed to the simple type, whilst Fagagna was 
taken as a variation on Krasnoe Sobakino, where 86 per cent of households 
were of extended or multiple type. 1 



Comparative social history is an extremely fruitful subject. But it is an 
absolute principle that like must be compared with like. To compare a village 
in pre-industrial Germany with one at the industrializing height of Victorian 
England is dubious. Yet to typify the whole of another 'ill-defined area' 
called 'Eastern Europe' on the basis of one serf-bound village in the depths 
of Russia is, for 'Western' scholars, alarmingly typical. Diversity 
schematized is diversity denied, [zadruga] 

Family history only came into its own in the 1970s. The English-language 
Journal of Family History dates from 1976. Hitherto, social scientists who 
studied family problems had apparently been 'indifferent to the historical 
dimensions', whilst social historians had been preoccupied with questions of 
class. Many scholars had assumed that a large, traditional, patriarchal form 
of household had existed in Europe since time immemorial, and hence that 
there was not much to study until the onset of modernization. The work of 
pioneers such as Frederic Le Play (1806-82), whose Organisation de la 
Familie (1871) introduced a typology of families, was not widely known. Le 
Play posited three family types: the patriarchal extended family; the familie 
souche or 'stem-family', with three generational nuclei; and the unstable 
household unit or cellule, which only existed as long as the parents were 
raising children. Apart from genealogy, which had a very long genealogy, 
the systematic study of family problems in history had to wait for a hundred 
years. 2 

None the less, the variety of studies within the field has become very 
impressive. One can find studies of everything from wet-nursing techniques 
in medieval Iceland to bastardy in seventeenth-century England, or paternal 
authority in nineteenth-century Sardinia. There are several main lines of 
enquiry. One concerns the formation, structures, and disintegration of 
household units, [baserria] Another centres on the statistical, biological, 
and sexual trends within the realm of family and kin. A third focuses on the 
problems of the individuals, of the sexes, and of the generations within the 
family unit-and hence on 'life-course analysis', on women, on labour 
patterns, on childhood, marriage, and old age. [grillenstein] A fourth, 
anthropological focus highlights family customs, ceremonies, and rituals. A 
fifth is legal, examining the evolutions of family law and government policy. 
A sixth is economic, examining family budgets in varying agrarian, urban, or 
industrial contexts. All modern family problems, from single-parenting to 



unemployment, child discipline, and juvenile crime, have historical roots. 
Nor has genealogy been forgotten. What was once the passion of a noble 
elite has recently become the most popular of pastimes. 3 

To some extent, historians' interests reflect the nature of available 
sources. The households of the medieval nobility, for example, or of 
Renaissance merchants had long been accessible because both left copious 
records, [mercante] The households of the peasantry or plebs were much 
less accessible. Yet the application of sociological and quantitative 
techniques [rentes] and the exploitation of visual, literary, statistical, and 
oral sources has opened up a wealth of information. No period or location 
has escaped. Family history has universal appeal. For everyone has either 
been, or has missed being, the member of a family. 


Catherine, too, presents the historian with 'images of splendor contending 
with the specter of scandal'.- A German princess, born in Stettin as Sophia 
Augusta Frederica von Alhalt-Zerbst, she has few equals in the annals of 
grasping ambition. Her gross sexual licence was not in itself out of place, but 
must be judged repulsive when mixed with foul intrigue. The rumour that she 
died through the failure of a machine called 'Catherine's Winch' whilst trying to 
make love with a horse is notable only because people have been willing to 
believe it. More to the point, she seized the throne through a palace putsch, 
having incited the imperial guards to murder her husband, Peter III (r. 1761-2). 
She governed with the cooperation of a long line often official lovers-from 
Gregory Orlov, and Gregory Potemkin to Platon Zubov, 38 years her junior. In 
her favour, it can be said that she headed a civilian entourage practising 
persuasion more than terror. An indulgent biographer might conclude: 'she did 
for Russia what Louis XIV did for France before he became the prisoner of 
Versailles... autocracy [was] cleansed from the stains of tyranny... despotism 
turned into a monarchy.'- 

Praetorian revolutions became a habit with the Romanovs, as with the 
Romans. Legal succession by the dynastic heir was a rarity. Catherine I (r. 1725- 
7), alias Skovorotska, a Latvian peasant girl and Peter's second consort, 
overthrew him on his deathbed. Peter II (r. 1727-30) succeeded through a forged 
will; the Empress Anne (r. 1730-40), Duchess of Courland, through a ploy of the 
Privy Council; Ivan VI (r. 1740-1), the infant Duke of Brunswick, through a 





scheme of Baron Biron; the Empress Elizabeth (r. 1741-61), sometime fiancee 
of a Bishop of Liibeck and frequentee of the guards' barracks, through a 
straightforward coup de force; Alexander I (r. 1801-25), through the 
assassination of his father. Paul I (1796-1801), a would-be reformer-Tsar, was 
long held to be mentally unbalanced by official historiographers, obviously for 
being sane. When Paul insisted on exhuming the body of his murdered father, 
Peter III, and on reburying his parents in the cathedral of Peter and Paul, the 
aged Count Orlov was obliged to carry the imperial crown behind the coffin of 
the victim, whom he had killed 35 years before. This grisly act of reconciliation 
well symbolizes the fraud, fear, and violence which surrounded the court of St 
Petersburg and all its works. 

Muscovy took its giant leap out of the shadows during the second or Great 
Northern War, 1700-21. This 20-year contest centred on the rivalry of Peter the 
Great, who had set envious eyes on Swedish possessions at the head of the 
Baltic, and the youthful Charles XII of Sweden, who was eager to attack all his 
neighbours at once. It began in August 1700 with Charles's adventurous landing 
near Copenhagen and with Peter's disastrous attack on Narva, a Swedish fortress 
on the Gulf of Finland. But it was largely fought out on the intervening territory 
of Poland-Lithuania, whose King (Augustus, Elector of Saxony) had formed a 
private alliance with Peter. In the end, Poland-Lithuania was to be an even 
greater casualty than Sweden (see below). 

After the initial clashes Charles XII took the initiative on the mainland. He 
first aimed to punish Peter's Saxon ally, and in 1704 succeeded in replacing 
Augustus on the Polish throne with a leader of the pro-Swedish faction, 
Stanistaw Leszczynski. In so doing, he gave Peter the chance to grab the 
Swedish provinces of Livonia and Ingria, where in 1703 the foundation of the 
new city of St Petersburg was immediately proclaimed. In 1707 he turned east, 
counting on support from Livonia and from Mazeppa, Hetman of Ukraine. He 
was deceived on both scores. In the winter of 1708-9, harassed by peasant 
guerrillas, he was forced to abandon the original plan of a march on Moscow and 
to turn south. On 27 June 1709, at Poltava in Ukraine, he was comprehensively 
beaten and driven to take refuge in the Ottoman domains. The triumphant 
Muscovite armies swept westwards. Warsaw was occupied and Augustus II 
restored. The Baltic provinces remained in Muscovite hands. No shortage of 
vultures was found among the German princes to join Denmark and Prussia in 
preying on Sweden's more westerly possessions. Charles XII was killed in action 
in November 1718, besieging the fortress of Frederikshald on the Norwegian- 



Swedish frontier. A diplomatic congress held on the Aland Islands preceded the 
Russo-Swedish Treaty signed at nearby Nystadt (1721). Sweden was humbled. 
Peter was left the arbiter of the North, the proud possessor of his 'Window on the 
West'. In 1721 he promoted himself from the style of Muscovite 'Tsar' to that of 
Emperor-a title not generally recognized in his lifetime, [petrograd] 

As Muscovy assumed its imperial mantle, far-reaching reforms were 
imposed to turn the new Empire into a modern, Western state. In the eyes of 
Peter I, in particular, reform was equivalent to 'Westernisation'. The Tsar made 
two lengthy visits to Western Europe, in 1696-8 and in 1717, taking notes on the 
techniques of everything from naval construction to face-shaving. But it was the 
Great Northern War that served as Russia's taskmaster. First and foremost came 
the Tsar's demand for a standing army, and for the financial and social 
institutions required to support it. The old Muscovite state had been monstrously 
inefficient. A ragbag army, which melted away in winter, was consuming the 
produce of two-thirds of the population and, in bad years like 1705, up to 96 per 
cent of the state's revenues. By the end of Peter's reign a permanent force of 
over 300,000 trained men was supported by a poll-tax or 'soul tax', which had 
tripled revenue, by peasant conscription, and by the reorganization of the 
nobility. 

Few stones were left unturned. A key statute, the Preobrazhensky Prikaz 
(1701), regulated the system of political police. Important changes were made by 
the division of the country into guberniyas or 'provinces' (1705); by the creation 
of a senate and of administrative colleges within the central administration 
(1711); by the introduction of municipal government (1718-24); by the state 
promotion of trade, industry, education, literature, science, and the arts. In 1721 
the Patriarchate was abolished, subordinating the Russian Orthodox Church to 
the state-run Holy Synod. Priests were ordered to betray the secrets of the 
confessional. From 1722 the table of ranks tied an enlarged nobility into a 
hierarchical caste system wedded to state service and landed privileges. The 
creation of so many new institutions involved what one authority has called 'the 
partial dismantling of the Patrimonial State' and the first realization in Russia of 
the distinction between 'state' and 'society'.- This occurred even though no 
significant changes were made in the political sphere and the nobles themselves 
were held in abject servitude. They were subject to public flogging and 
shelmovanie (outlawry) for evading education or service. Most historians would 
now agree, in fact, that the Petrine reforms were not quite what contemporaries 
imagined. They did not act as a great unifying force; on the contrary, they 


divided the loyalties of the Tsar's subjects, especially in matters of religion and 
nationality. Equally, they were apt to introduce the form of Western institutions 
whilst ignoring the substance. Peter could not turn Muscovites into Europeans by 
ordering them to shave their beards and to dress in powdered wigs. 

Catherine II cared more about the substance. Once again, despite the 
enlightened rhetoric, there was no tampering with the foundations of autocracy 
or serfdom. But her famous instruction to the legislative commission of 1766-8 
aiming at a modern legal code, her centralizing and 'russifying' tendencies in 
provincial administration, and, above all, her acceptance of the 'freedom of the 
nobility' made lasting modifications to the system. The Charter of Nobility 
(1785), which confirmed an earlier decree granting limited rights of noble 
assembly and self-government in the provinces, complemented the table of 
ranks; and ancient restrictions on the sale of serfs as chattels were eased. The 
final product was a compromise, half-old, half-new: a hybrid whereby the 
autocratic monarchy was gradually rendered dependent on the service nobility 
which it had created, whilst the nobility could not transmit to central government 
the power which they wielded over the mass of the population in the localities. 
'Paradoxically, by their insistence on the monopoly of political power, the 
Russian autocrats secured less effective authority than their constitutional 
counterparts in the West.'- The old Muscovite tyranny was at least consistent. 
The new Russian Empire contained the seeds of its own destruction, [euler] 

None the less, Russia's remorseless expansion continued (see Appendix III, 
p. 1277). A country that already possessed more land than it could usefully 
exploit kept on indulging its gargantuan appetite. In the west, Russia ate up the 
larger part of Sweden-Finland and of Poland-Lithuania. In the south, starting 
with Azov (1696), it swallowed up the whole of the Ottomans' Black Sea 
provinces and Crimea (1783), before moving against Persia, the Caucasus, and 
Central Asia. In the east, having crossed Siberia to the Pacific, from the 1740s it 
explored the shores of Alaska, where a permanent settlement was built on 
Kodiak Island in 1784. 

Russian historians have rationalized their country's expansion in terms of 
'national tasks' and 'the gathering of the lands'. In reality, Russia and its rulers 
were addicted to territorial conquest. Their land-hunger was the symptom of a 
pathological condition born of gross inefficiency and traditional militarism. It is 
highly ironic that the world's largest country needed an ever-growing supply of 
land and people to offset its sense of insecurity, to execute operations which 


others achieved with far smaller resources, and to reward the overblown machine 
which guarded the Romanovs' throne. Here, if ever, was an extreme case of 
bulimia politico, of the so-called 'canine hunger', of gross territorial obesity in 
an organism which could only survive by consuming more and more of its 
neighbours' flesh and blood. Every successful Russian officer needed an estate 
mn by hundreds or thousands of serfs, to support his family in the accustomed 
style. Of 800,000 such conquered 'souls' redistributed by Catherine II, no fewer 
than 500,000 came from Poland-Lithuania alone. Significantly, whilst the 
German nobility of the ex-Swedish 'Baltikum' were permitted to retain their 
privileges, the ex-Polish nobility of Lithuania and Ruthenia (Byelorussia and 
Ukraine) were not. 

Within the expanding Russian empire, Ukraine upheld its separate identity 
for more than a hundred years. From 1654 to 1783 the 'Hetman State' of Ukraine 
was ruled, under Tsarist supervision, by the heirs of the Dnieper Cossacks who 
had first sought the Tsar's alliance against Poland. Their bid to break free under 
Hetman Mazeppa during the Swedish invasion of 1708-9 (see above) came to 
nothing. Their suppression coincided with the annexation of Crimea and the end 
of their usefulness as a buffer against Tartars and Ottomans, [Rusq 

Thereafter, the historic distinction between Ruthenia and Russia was 
officially suppressed. Ukraine was renamed Malorossiya (Little Russia), and all 
traces of its separate traditions were erased. Its Cossacks were denied the same 
degree of autonomy granted to their Russian counterparts on the Don or the 
Kuban. Its rich lands were subjected to intense russification and colonization. 
The 'wild plains' of the south, Europe's last frontier, were settled with peasant 
immigrants, mainly Russians and Germans. The monopoly of the Russian 
Orthodox Church among the Slavs was enforced, as was the public use of the 
Russian language. Any remaining Uniates were removed. Russian immigrants 
began to change the complexion of the cities, especially Kiev, now presented as 
an ancient Russian city. Ukrainian, Polish, and Jewish culture steadily lost 
ground. The Ruthenian (Ukrainian) language, which survived in the countryside, 
was officially described as a Russian dialect The magnificent new port of 
Odessa, founded in 1794 as capital of the province of'New Russia', opened an 
outlet for the growing corn trade, a window to the south, [potemkin] 

The Republic of Poland-Lithuania was the principal European casualty of 
Russia's expansion. Indeed, the Republic's demise was the sine qua non of the 



Russian Empire's success. Like its former province of Ukraine, the Republic was 
the object first of Muscovite penetration and then of alternating periods of 
indirect and direct rule. Muscovite influence rose steadily after the death of 
Sobieski in 1696. 


RUS' 

On 6 September 1749, in St Petersburg, the imperial historian, Dr Gerhard 
Muller, rose to read a paper in Latin on The Name and Origin of Russia'. 
He was to expound his theory that the ancient Kievan state had been founded 
by Norsemen. But he was shouted down; his patriotic Russian audience was 
not willing to hear how Russia had not been founded by Slavs. After an 
official inquiry, Dr Muller was ordered to abandon the subject and his 
existing publications were destroyed. (He at least escaped the fate of the 
Lrench scholar, Nicholas Preret, who had died that same year, and who had 
once been cast into the Bastille for writing that the Pranks were not 
descended from Trojans.) 1 

Historians of Russia have been arguing about the 'Normanist' theory 
ever since. Owing to state censorship, Russian history has been subjected to 
a peculiar degree of political interference and teleological argument. The 
story of the Kievan State has been made to serve the interests of modern 
Russian nationalism, or else, in reaction to the Russian version, the interests 
of modern Ukrainian nationalism. It has proved impossible to deny, 
however, that Norsemen were in some way involved. The name of Rus' has 
been variously ascribed to 'red-haired' Vikings (cf. russet in English); to 
ruotsi, a Pinnish name for Swedes; to a Scandinavian tribe called Rhos, 
unknown in Scandinavia; and even to a multinational mercantile consortium 
based at Rodez in Languedoc. 

According to this last ingenious (and unlikely) hypothesis, Rodez Inc. 
used Norse seamen to penetrate the Khazarian slave-market via the Baltic- 
Dnieper route and, c. ad 830, to oust the rival Jewish Radaniya consortium, 
which had controlled the slave-trade from the Black Sea to North Africa 
from Arles. Having established a 'kaganate' of Rus' over Khazaria, the 
Rodezians supposedly changed from a ruling foreign elite centred on 




T"mutorakan/Tamartarka on the Volga into the native princes of a 
predominantly Slav community centred on Kiev. 2 [khazaria] 

Where firm conclusions prove impossible, the re-examination of sources 
is essential. Yet the most forbidding aspect of Kievan scholarship lies in the 
vast range of its source materials. Apart from the Slavic and Byzantine 
chronicles, scholars must examine Old Norse literature, comparative 
Germanic and Turkic (Khazarian) mythology, runic inscriptions, 
Scandinavian and Friesian law codes, Danish and Icelandic annals, Arab 
geographies, Hebrew documents, even Turkic inscriptions from Mongolia. 
Archaeology, too, is vital. One rare element of hard evidence in the puzzle 
lies with Arab coins that are found in hoards all over Eastern Europe, 
[dirham] The earliest mention of Kiev-in the form of OYYWB- occurs in 
a Hebrew letter now in Cambridge University Library, which was written by 
Jews in Khazaria to the synagogue of Fustat-Misr near Cairo. 3 

Yet from Dr Muller's time to 1991 the main obstacle to scholarship lay 
in the fact that no one in Russia or Ukraine was free to pursue independent 
research. The emergence of a free Ukraine, and of a free Russia, may or may 
not improve the academic climate, [metryka] [Smolensk] 


In the course of the Great Northern War, it reached the stage where a Russian 
protectorate could be established in all but name. Then, after decades of turmoil 
between would-be Polish reformers and Russian-backed agents of the status quo, 
it moved towards the logical conclusion of the Partitions. Between 1772 and 
1795, Russia led the feast in which the Republic was totally consumed. 

John Sobieski (r. 1674-96) earned glory abroad whilst neglecting problems 
at home. The Siege of Vienna showed that the Republic was still a first-rate 
military power; but it was the final fling. Lithuania was left to stew in civil war; 
the Sejm was repeatedly broken by the liberum veto; the magnates went 
unpunished; central legislation and taxation ground to a halt. By the unratified 
'Eternal Treaty' with Moscow in 1686, Ukraine was abandoned. The King spent 
his strength fighting for the Holy League, hoping to carve out a base for his son 
in Moldavia. Many years later, gazing at Sobieski's statue in Warsaw, a Russian 
Tsar was to remark: 'Here is another [like me] who wasted his life fighting the 
Turk'.- 





The royal election of 1697 dashed all the Sobieskis' schemes. Jakub Sobieski 
did not gain the electors' confidence; the Austrian candidate was outbribed; the 
French candidate, the Due de Conti, was shipwrecked off the coast of Danzig. 
Thanks to Russian gold and a timely conversion to Catholicism, the prize was 
won by Friedrich-August, Elector of Saxony, who took to the throne as Augustus 
II. The exiled Sobieskis had nothing left but to marry their daughter to the exiled 
Stuarts, who came to grief at the same time. Bonnie Prince Charlie had a Polish 
mother. 

The Saxon period-under Augustus II (r. 1697-1704, 1710-33) and 
Augustus III (r. 1733-63)-is generally judged to be the nadir of Polish history. 
The Great Northern War, in which the Polish King, in his capacity as Elector of 
Saxony, was a leading combatant, brought endless disasters and divisions. 
Poland-Lithuania was fought over as the main theatre of operations between 
Swedes and Russians, each of whom was supported by a rival confederation of 
Polish nobles (see above). It was treated by the Saxon court as a counterweight 
to neighbouring Prussia and as a source of plunder. The Saxon army, when 
deployed in Poland, was immune to the protests of the Sejm. Its depredations led 
to the conflict between King and nobility which had much in common with the 
parallel conflict in nearby Hungary. This in turn gave an opening for direct 
Russian intervention. 

After the Russian victory at Poltava in 1709, Augustus II only recovered his 
Polish throne with the aid of Russian troops. Thereafter he was seen as a double 
danger, both as a pawn of the Tsar and as an 'absolutist' in his own right. In 
1715-16 open warfare broke out between the King and his opponents. For the 
Tsar, it was a heaven-sent opportunity. By acting as mediator, Peter the Great 
could save the Polish nobles from their Saxon king whilst imposing conditions 
that would reduce the Republic to dependence. At the 'Silent Sejm' or 'Dumb 
Diet' summoned to Warsaw in January 1717, the Russian army stood by as the 
following pre-arranged resolutions were passed without debate: 


POTEMKIN 


In 1787 Field Marshal Prince Gregory Potemkin (1739-91), Governor of I 
New Russia, organized a river journey down the Dnieper for the Empress 




Catherine and her court. His aim was to prove his success in colonizing the 
province, recently wrested from the Ottomans. To this end he assembled a 
number of mobile 'villages', each located at a strategic spot on the river 
bank. As soon as the imperial barge hove into sight Potemkin's men, all 
dressed up as jolly peasants, raised a hearty cheer for the Empress and the 
foreign ambassadors. Then, as soon as it turned the bend, they stripped off 
their caps and smocks, dismantled the sets, and rebuilt them overnight 
further downstream. Since Catherine was Potemkin's lover at the time, it is 
not possible to believe that she was ignorant of the ploy; the principal dupes 
were the foreign ambassadors. 'Potemkin Villages' has become a byword for 
the long Russian tradition of deception and disinformation. 1 Force and fraud 
are the stock-in-trade of all dictatorships. But in Russia Potemkinism has 
been a recurring theme. 

On this subject, the views of a professional deceptionist may not be 
entirely irrelevant. According to a senior KGB defector, Western opinion has 
been skilfully and systematically duped ever since Lenin's NEP. The control 
of all information, combined with selective leaks and plants, enabled the 
Soviet security service to feed the West with an endless stream of false 
impressions. The 'de-Stalinization' of the 1950s was only a modified form of 
Stalinism. The 'Sino-Soviet split' of 1960 was jointly engineered by the 
CPSU and the CPC. 'Romanian Independence' was a myth invented for the 
convenience both of Moscow and Bucharest. Czechoslovak 
'democratization' in 1968 was orchestrated by progressive elements in the 
KGB. 'Eurocommunism' was another sham. Even 'Solidarity' in Poland was 
mn by Moscow's agents. Published in 1984, before Gorbachev's rise to 
power, this expose of the KGB by an insider is obligatory reading for anyone 
pondering the ambiguities of glasnost' and perestroika ', or the mysteries of 
the 1991 'Putsch'. The problem is: when do professional deceivers stop 
deceiving? 2 

Apart from his 'villages', Prince Potemkin is most often associated with 
the battleship named after him, whose mutinous crew sailed out of Odessa 
during the Revolution of 1905. People inevitably wonder whether that 
mutiny, too, was a fake. 3 [sovkino] 

The proponents of conspiracy theory hold that all historical events mask the 
designs of tricksters, plotters, and evil 'unidentified forces'. Their opponents 



suggest the opposite, that conspiracy and deception do not exist. Both are 
badly mistaken, [propaganda] 


1. The King's Saxon army was to be banished from the Republic. (In other words, 
the King lost all semblance of an independent power base.) 

2 . The 'golden liberties' of the nobility were to be upheld. (In other words, 
through the preservation of the liberum veto, the central government of the 
Republic could be paralysed whenever convenient) 

3 . The armed forces of the Republic were to be limited to 24,000 men. (In other 
words, Poland-Lithuania was to be rendered defenceless.) 

4. The armed forces were to be financed through allocations from a list of royal, 
ecclesiastical, and magnatial estates. (In other words, they were put beyond 
the control of king or Sejm.) 

5 . The settlement was to be guaranteed by the Tsar. (In other words, the Tsar 
could intervene in Poland-Lithuania at any time, and could legally suppress 
any movement for Reform.) 

Henceforth, to all intents and purposes the Republic of Poland-Lithuania became 
a Russian protectorate, a mere appendage to the Russian Empire, a vast buffer- 
state which sheltered Russia from the West but cost nothing to maintain, [eros] 

Under Augustus III the central government collapsed completely. The King 
had to be installed by a Russian army which had overturned the re-election of 
Stanislaw Leszczynski, thereby sparking off the War of the Polish Succession; 
but he usually stayed in Dresden. The Sejm was regularly summoned, but 
regularly blocked by the liberum veto before it could meet. Only one session in 
30 years was able to pass legislation. By an extreme example of the principle of 
subsidiarity, government was left to the magnates and to the provincial dietines. 
The Republic had no diplomacy, no treasury, no defence. It could enact no 
reforms. It was the butt of the philosophes. When the first volume of the French 
Encyclopedie was published in 1751, the prominent article on 'Anarchie' was all 
about Poland, [cantata] [szlachta] 

The reforming party fled abroad, thereby starting the unbroken Polish 
tradition of political emigration. Stanislaw Leszczynski, twice elected king and 
twice driven out by the Russians, took refuge in France. Having married his 




daughter to Louis XV he was given the Duchy of Lorraine where, at Nancy, as le 
bon roi Stanislas he could practise the enlightened government forbidden at 
home. 

Stanislaw August Poniatowski (r. 1764-95), the last King of Poland, was a 
tragic and in some ways a noble figure. One of Catherine the Great's earlier 
lovers, he was put in place with the impossible task of reforming the Republic 
whilst preserving the Russian supremacy. As it was, shackled by the constitution 
of 1717, he provoked the very convulsions which reform was supposed to avoid. 
How could one curtail the nobles' sacred right of resistance without some nobles' 
resisting? How could one limit the Russians' right of intervention without the 
Russians intervening? How could one abolish the liberum veto without someone 
exercising the liberum veto 7 . The King tried to break the vicious circle on three 
occasions; and on three occasions he failed. On each occasion a Russian army 
arrived to restore order, and on each occasion the Republic was punished with 
partition. In the 1760s the King's proposals for reform led to the war of the 
Confederation of Bar (1768-72) and to the First Partition. In 1787-92 the King's 
support for the reforms of the Great Sejm and the Constitution of 3 May (1791) 
led to the Confederation of Targowica and the Second Partition (see Chapter IX). 
In 1794-5 the King's adherence to the national rising of Tadeusz Kosciuszko led 
to the final denouement. After the Third Partition, there was no Republic left 
over which to reign. Poniatowski abdicated on St Catherine's Day 1795, and 
died in Russian exile. 


CANTATA 

In October 1734, when the newly crowned King of Poland returned home 
at short notice, his music master had to compose an entire nine-part Cantata 
Gratulatoria in three days flat. The words were as baroque as the soaring 
music: 

i 

Chorsatz ^ re ' se c ^ e ' n Glucl ce, gesegnetes Sachsen 

(Praise Thy Good Fortune, blessed 
Saxony) 

4. Was hat dich sonst, Sarmatien, bewogen 

Rezitativ ...? 

(What has stirred thee, Sarmatia ...?) 




5. Arie 


Rase nur verwegner Schwarm... 

(Bluster now, presumptuous swarm, in 
thine own bowels!) 

7. Arie Durch die von Eifer entflammeten Waffen 

(To punish one's enemies with weapons 
inflamed by zeal...) 

g 

' . . Lass dock, o teurer Landesvater. zu 

Rezitativ 

(Grant then, O Father of our country, that 
the Muses may honour the Day when 
Sarmatia elected thee King.) 

9. Stifter der Reiche, Beherrscher der 

Chorsatz Kronen ... 

(Founder of Empires, Lord of Crowns ...) 


The events which prompted the cantata have been long forgotten. But the 
music could be reworked into later compositions, and became immortal. No. 
7 became No. 47 in the Christmas Oratorio. No. 1 now forms the 
'Hosannah' of the B Minor Mass. For the King of Poland was also the 
Elector of Saxony, and his music master was Johann Sebastian Bach. 1 


Throughout the terminal agony of the Republic, the Grand Duchy of 
Lithuania preserved its individuality. Its political weakness did not preclude a 
vigorous life which made it the source of four lasting traditions. Its capital city- 
Wilno-Vil'na-Vilnius-was a true cultural crossroads. The dominant Polish elite 
was doubly reinforced, first by the National Education Commission after 1773 
and later by a regional board of education, based on the University of Wilno, 
which was to flourish under tsarist rule until 1825. Lithuania's Yiddish culture 
was to be strengthened when the Grand Duchy was made the basis for Russia's 
Jewish Pale of Settlement. The Lithuanian and Ruthenian (Byelorussian) 
peasantry, having preserved themselves from polonization, retained enough of 
their substance to withstand all the russifications of the future. Once absorbed by 
the Russian Empire, the Grand Duchy would never revive as an administrative 
entity. But its inhabitants would not completely forget their origins. They would 
participate in all the Polish risings of the nineteenth century. The Polish and 
Jewish traditions would hold out until the murderous era of Stalin and Hitler. 
The Lithuanian and to a lesser extent the Byelorussian traditions would survive 
hell and high water to reach independence in the 1990s. [b.n.r.][Lietuva] 




The international relations of the eighteenth century were concerned, above all, 
with the balance of power. All the general wars of the period were designed to 
maintain it (see Appendix III, pp. 1282-3). No one state felt strong enough to 
attempt the military conquest of the entire Continent; but relatively minor 
regional disturbances could provoke a chain reaction of coalitions and alliances 
to contain the perceived threat. Few matters of ideology or national pride were 
involved. Alliances could be rapidly permutated, and small professional armies 
could march swiftly into action to settle the disputes in tidy, set-piece battles. 
With the Concert of Europe in full operation, a series of diplomatic congresses 
could weigh out the consequences of the fighting and draw up the balance sheet 
of colonies, fortresses, and districts won or lost. Generally speaking, these wars 
served their purpose. No major redistribution of power and territory took place 
in Europe as the direct result of military conquest. Such adjustments that war did 
provoke-notably through the cession of Spanish territories at Utrecht or 
through Prussia's seizure of Silesia-cannot compare to the greatest of all the 
territorial redistributions of the era, the Partitions of Poland, which were 
arranged without recourse to war. [dessein] 

The three Partitions of Poland-Lithuania furnish the finest examples which 
European history can boast of peaceful aggression. Completed in three stages, in 
1773, 1793, and 1795, they divided up the assets of a state the size of France. 
They were carried out by gangsterish methods, where the unwritten threat of 
violence underlay all the formal agreements and where the victims were forced 
to condone their own mutilation. Many contemporary observers, thankful for the 
avoidance of war, were conditioned to accept the partitioned' explanations. 
Many historians have accepted the view that the Poles brought disaster on 
themselves. It took a Burke, a Michelet, or a Macaulay to call a crime a crime. 

The mechanism of the Partitions rested on two simple considerations: first, 
that a Russian army of intervention was required to suppress the Polish reform 
movement; and secondly, that a Russian advance into the Republic posed a threat 
to the Republic's other neighbours, Prussia and Austria. After the draining 
experience of the Seven Years War, Prussia in particular was in no condition to 
fight another war against Russia. Instead, it was suggested that Prussian and 
Austrian interests could best be protected if, as the price of their acquiescence in 
Russian actions in Poland, they could be given territorial compensation. So, by 
general agreement of its neighbours, the defenceless Republic was to submit to 
the suppression of its reformers by Russian force, and to pay for the operation by 
the cession of huge tracts of territory. What was worse, the Republic had to listen 



in silence whilst its tormentors told the world of their generous and peaceful 
intentions. 


DESSEIN 

When the second edition of the Due de Sully's memoirs were prepared for 
publication in 1742, a great deal of re-editing was done. In particular, a large 
number of the Duke's scattered and often contradictory comments on foreign 
relations were simplified and consolidated into one single chapter entitled 
The Political Scheme commonly called the Grand Design of Henri the 
Great'. In this way, Sully's Grand Dessein was reconstructed, not to say 
invented, more than a century after his death. Critics have argued that it was 
a product more of the eighteenth than of the seventeenth century. 1 

It must be said that Maximilien de Bethune (1560-1641), Baron de 
Rosny and Due de Sully, had little to do with foreign policy during his 
decade as Henri IV's chief minister. He had been Superintendent of the 
Royal Finances, Grand Voyer (from viarius, 'master of the roads') of France, 
Grand Master of Artillery and then of Fortifications, and Governor of the 
Bastille. 2 His thoughts on international relations date from his first years in 
retirement after 1610 and then, with major amendments, from the Thirty 
Years War. He had published them all, unsorted, in the two volumes of his 
Memoires des sages et royales oeconomies d'estat (1638). 

Sully's immediate purpose was to reduce the preponderance of the 
Habsburgs. From this essentially opportunist purpose, however, he drew up a 
plan which envisaged both a new map of Europe and the machinery for 
maintaining a perpetual peace. The map was to consist of fifteen equal states 
that would be created by confining Spain to Iberia, by separating the House 
of Austria from the Empire, and by redistributing their possessions. The 
Spanish Netherlands, for example, were either to be divided between 
England and France or to be given to the United Provinces. Hungary was to 
be restored as an independent elective monarchy. The imperial throne in 
Germany was to be filled by open elections, and free from the monopoly 
power of any one dynasty. In the interests of perpetual peace, Sully planned 
a European League of Princes. The League was to be governed by a Federal 




Council, where the greater powers would hold four seats each and the others 
two, and where the chairmanship, starting with the Elector of Bavaria, would 
rotate. It would use its combined forces to settle disputes and to enforce 
policy. 

The key concept behind both the new map and the new league was to be 
'equilibrium of strength'. No power was to be strong enough to impose its 
will on the others. Europe was to be 'une republique tres chretienne' and 
'one great family'. Within its borders, it was to enjoy freedom of trade. 
Beyond its borders, it was to destroy the Turk and to undertake 'convenient' 
conquests in Asia and North Africa. 

Fashioned by a statesman in irresponsible retirement, and refashioned by 
an eighteenth-century editor, the Grand Design has more than a smack of 
abstract theorizing. It may have been influenced by emeric Cruce's Nouveau 
Cynee (1623), with its plan for a world-wide peace assembly to be chaired 
by the pope at Venice, which in turn may have owed something to the 
'League of Perpetual Union' proposed by a Bohemian king as long ago as 
1458 (see p. 428). It certainly belonged to the long tradition of theoretical 
writing from Dante's De Monarchia to Erasmus and Campanella. But 
popularized in the age of the 'balance of power', it attracted great attention. 
In the two centuries which separated its relaunch from the League of Nations 
and the European Community, its basic thoughts on international stability, on 
free trade, on pooled sovereignty, and on joint enforcement have not ceased 
to appeal. Above all, it recognized what many ignored, that peace is a 
function of power. 3 


In the first round, the point was reached in the late 1760s when the turmoil in 
Poland-Lithuania could no longer be contained. The King's proposals for limited 
reform had stirred up opposition on all sides. The Prussians had bombarded 
Polish customs posts on the Vistula, thereby ending all preparations for a modern 
fiscal system. The Russians had been stirring up a campaign against the alleged 
maltreatment of religious minorities in Poland, and had carried off the Polish 
bishops who protested. The Confederates of Bar, led by Casimir Pulaski (1747- 
79), bad taken the field to oppose both the King and the Russians. In 1769 the 
Austrians had used the uproar to seize the thirteen towns of the district of Spisz. 
St Petersburg would be obliged to take drastic action as soon as its Turkish war 




permitted. Berlin saw the chance: Prussia would not oppose Russian intervention 
if granted the Polish province of Royal Prussia. Austria would agree if given a 
slice of southern Poland: 'The more she wept/ joked Frederick II of Maria 
Theresa, 'the more she took.' Russia would take most of'White Ruthenia'. 

The first Treaty of Partition was signed in St Petersburg on 5 August 1772. 
Legal niceties were observed throughout. The air was filled with homage to 
Poland's 'golden freedom'. Then the victim was persuaded to wield the knife. 
The King placed a motion in favour of the Partition before the Sejm. The one 
member to protest, Tadeusz Rejtan, who lay across the threshold of the Chamber 
to bar the King's entry, was later declared insane. The three treaties of secession 
between the Republic and each of the partitioning powers were completed on 
7/18 September 1773. The one sovereign to protest was the King of Spain. 'I 
have partaken eucharistically of Poland's body,' was Frederick's comment, 'but I 
don't know how the Queen-Empress has squared her confessor.' 

The First Partition bought several years of relative calm. Poland-Lithuania 
was absorbed with the labours of the National Education Commission (see 
above); and in 1775 the King was given permission to form the outlines of 
ministerial government. All the Confederates of Bar had been deported to 
Siberia or had fled abroad. Pulaski had gone off to America, where he founded 
the US Cavalry. Russia, Prussia, and Austria were busy absorbing their ill-gotten 
gains. 

The century of the Enlightenment drew to its close with the spectacle of 
three enlightened despots taking concerted action to crush an enlightened reform 
movement. The assault on the Polish state was accompanied by much 
enlightened rhetoric; and the consequent 'rationalization of the map of Europe' 
was widely excused. 'Un polonais-', quipped Voltaire, 'c'est un charmeur; 
deux polonais- une bagarre; trois polonais, eh bien, c'est la question polonaise' 
(one Pole-a charmer, two Poles-a brawl, three Poles-the Polish Question).- 

[METRYKA] 

Yet the basic problem remained. Poland-Lithuania was still a Russian 
captive, and the reformers were straining at the leash. If the King were to lose 
control, others would act for him. And as soon as they moved, the whole cycle of 
reform and repression would begin again. It began in 1787. 

Monday evening, 29 October 1787, Prague. In the National Theatre of Count 
Nostitz in the old city (now the Tyl Theatre), Bondini's Italian opera company 


was presenting the premiere of II dissoluto punito, 'The Rake's Reward'. The 
performance had originally been advertised for the evening of the 14th, under 
the title of 'The Guest of Stone', when it had been intended to entertain the 
Princess of Tuscany on the way to her wedding in Dresden. In the event, the 
score of the new opera had not been completed. According to one Vaclav 
Svoboda (Wenzel Swoboda), who played the double bass in the orchestra, the 
composer had sat up all the Sunday night of the 28th with a small army of 
copyists; and the score of the overture was delivered to the theatre with the ink 
still wet on the page.- But the players were not deterred. Cheering broke out 
when the composer took his bow at the front of the candlelit auditorium at 7 p.m. 
Two extended forte chords in D minor brought the uproar to a halt. Then the 
music sped away, molto allegro, info the fast chatter of the overture's opening 
bars. 

Ouverture 

Str. 2 FI. 2 Ob. 2 Cl. 2 Bsn. 2 Hn. 2 Tr. Timp. 



At the end of the overture the maestro turned to the orchestra and complemented 
them on their sight-reading: 'Bravo, Bravo, meine Herren, das war 
ausgezeichnet' (Bravo, Gentlemen, that was admirable). 

The libretto, as printed in advance for the court, could be bought at the box- 
office in Italian only (40 kr. bound in gold paper, 20 kr. ordinary). The title-page

IL DISSOLUTO PUNITO. O sia II D. Giovanni. Dramma giocoso in due atti. 
Da representarsi nel Teatro di Praga l'anno 1787. In Praga di Schoenfeld ... La 
Poesia e dell'Ab Da Ponte, Poeta de' Teatri Imperiali di Vienna. La Musica e del 
Sig Wolfgango Mozzart, Maestro di Cap, dadesco. 


The cast was: Giovanni-Luigi Bassi; Anna-Teresa Saporiti; Ottavio-Antonio 
Baglioni; Elvira-Caterina Micelli; Leporello-Felice Ponziani; Zerlina- 
Caterina Bondini (wife of the impresario); Commendatore-Giuseppe Lolli.- 

Mozart's Don Giovanni, as it came to be known, was but the latest variant of 
a popular tale of seduction that had reached the status of a European myth. Don 
Juan, the burlador of Seville, had been played over two centuries both in 
Neapolitan carnival and in French fairground pantomime. It had been given 
literary form by Molina (1630), Cicognini (c.1650), Moliere (1665), Corneille 
(1677), Goldoni (1736), and Shadwell (1776). It had been set to music, for ballet 
or stage drama, at Rome in 1669, at Paris in 1746, at Turin in 1767, at Cassel in 
1770. In the decade before it reached Mozart it had inspired at least four full¬ 
blown operas-by Righini at Vienna (1777), by Albertini at Warsaw (1783), by 
Foppa/Guardi and Berlati/Gazzaniga at Venice (1787). Mozart's librettist, the 
Abbe da Ponte, had drawn heavily on Berlati's words; and the tenor who sang 
Ottavio in Prague had come post-haste from singing the same role to 
Gazzaniga's music in Venice.- 

The basic plot was disarmingly simple. In the opening scene Don Giovanni 
kills the Commendatore, the angry father of Anna, his latest amorous conquest. 
After numerous intrigues, he is twice confronted in the closing scenes by the 
dead Commendatore's statue, which cries for vengeance as the sinner is 
swallowed by the fires of Hell. Da Ponte condensed the story into two matching 
acts, each built round the same dramatic structure:

Collective Conclusion- 


No synopsis, however, could do justice to the exquisite partnership of the score 
and the libretto, whose memorable moments have withstood any amount of 
repetition and parody. In Aria No. 4 ('Madamina, il catalogo e questo') 
Giovanni's servant boasts to Elvira of his master's prowess in gallantry: 

In Italy six hundred and forty, 

In Germany, two hundred and thirty-one 
A hundred in France, in Turkey ninety-one, 

While in Spain already a thousand and three! Milk e tre!)- 

In the delicious No. 7 ('La ci darem la mano')-'the most perfect duet of 
seduction imaginable'-Giovanni wins the unsuspecting Zerlina without a trace 
of violence or deceit. His strong confident melody is picked up, played with by 
the soprano until both walk off arm in arm in a rapture of sheer delight: 


Duettino Zerlina, D. Giovanni 
Ser. 1 FL 2 Ob. 2 Bin. 2 Hn. Andante

In the melodramatic graveyard scene (Act II, Scene n) the players tremble as the 
Stone Guest declaims his eerie prophecy to the shattering accompaniment of 
trombones: 'By dawn you will have laughed for the last time': 


Sestetto D. Anna, D. Elvira, Zeriina, D. Ottavio, Leporello, Masetto 
Str. 2 FL2 Ob. 2 CL 2 Bsn. 2 Hn. 2 Tr. Timp. 



After the finale, when Giovanni's doom is complete, the cast is left singing the 
none-too-convincing moral in chorus to a scintillating double fugue: 

Questo e il fin di chi fa mal 
E de' perfidi la morte alia vita e sempre ugual 

(This is the end of the sinner's game I His life and death are just the same.)- 

For the opera's second performance, in Vienna seven months later, Mozart 
and Da Ponte made a number of changes to suit a new cast and a new theatre. To 
accommodate some additions, they dropped Ottavio's Aria, No. 21(22) ('II mio 
tesoro intanto'): 

Aha D. Ottavio 
Str. 2 CL 2 Bsn. 2 Hn. 

Andante grazloto 

-^73 i f >| ?. t *i jr P p QJJ i f t f-H

But the number was soon reinstated, and has remained an essential part of the 
standard repertoire ever since. 



















Mozart made two visits to Prague in 1787, both with his wife, Constanze. He 
was at the very peak of his career. During the first visit, in January and February, 
he presented his Symphony no. 38, 'The Prague' (K. 504), and later conducted a 
triumphant performance of Le nozze di Figaro. The reception was so favourable 
that he immediately signed a contract with Bondini for a new opera to be staged 
at the start of the next season. On his return to Vienna he gave some lessons to a 
seventeen-year-old pianist from Bonn called Beethoven. In May he was 
grievously stricken by the death of his beloved father and troubled by the 
settlement of the estate. Yet not a trace of his distress can be heard either in the 
Divertimento in F (K. 522) or in the delectable Fine Kleine Nachtmusik in G (K. 
525) both of which were composed that summer. 

Mozart's six-week trip to Prague with Don Giovanni can be traced both from 
his correspondence and from the local press. He left Vienna on 1 October, 
having just received the meagre proceeds of the auction of his father's chattels at 
Salzburg. He travelled again with Constanze, who was six months pregnant. The 
journey of c.150 miles took three days, since the Praeger Oberpostamtszeitung 
was already announcing his arrival on the 4th. 'The news has spread here that 
the opera newly written by [our celebrated Herr Mozart], Das steinerne 
Gastmahl be given for the first time at the National Theatre.'- He took rooms in 
the Three Lions Inn at Kohlmarkt 20, and was joined four days later by his 
librettist Da Ponte, who stayed across the street at the Glatteis Hotel. The 13th, 
14th, and 15th were taken up by the visit of the Princess of Tuscany, and by the 
last-minute decision to stage a German version of Le nozze de Figaro for her 
benefit. Mozart at this point was despondent. 'Everything dawdles along here,' 
he wrote to a friend, 'because the singers, who are lazy, refuse to rehearse on 
opera days, and the manager, who is anxious and timid, will not force them.'- 
The last week of the month was taken up by the sickness of various singers, and 
by the lack of an overture. But finally the premiere took place amidst universal 
applause. The Oberpostamtszeitung was ecstatic: 

On Monday ... the Italian Opera company gave the ardently awaited opera by Maestro Mozard [sic], Don 
Giovanni... Connoisseurs and musicians say that Prague has never yet heard the like... Everybody on the 
stage and in the orchestra strained every nerve to thank Mozard by rewarding him with a good performance. 
There were also heavy additional costs, caused by several choruses and changes of scenery, all of which 
Herr Guardosoni had brilliantly attended to. The unusually large attendance testifies to unanimous 
approbation.- 

The opera was repeated on 3 November for Mozart's personal benefit. The 


Mozarts left Prague on the 13th, but not before several prominent Praguers had 
written lavish compliments in the composer's scrapbook: 

When Orpheus' magic lute out-rings 
Amphion to his lyre sings, 

The lions tame, the rivers quiet grow, 

The tigers listen, rocks a-walking go. 

When Mozart masterly music plays 
And gathers undivided praise, 

The quire of Muses stays to hear, 

Apollo is himself all ear. 

Your admirer and friend,

Mozart's Journey to Prague, 1787 


During their second trip to Prague the Mozarts stayed much of the time with 
their friends the Duseks, in their Villa Bertramka at Smichov, where the final 
numbers of Don Giovanni were completed. Franz Dusek was a concert pianist; 
his wife, Jozefa, a soprano and long-standing friend with whom Mozart felt 
greatly at ease. Before leaving, Mozart was recommended for the sinecure of 
imperial Kammermusikus. 

He arrived back in Vienna to find that the annual salary offered was only 800 
gulden, the previous incumbent, Gluck, having died with a salary of 2,000. As 





always, his prestige outstripped his finances. On 27 December Constanze gave 
birth to their fourth child, a daughter who lived for six months. Mozart was 
coming to the end of a golden decade. 

Mozart's collaboration with the Abbe Da Ponte marks a milestone in Europe's 
musical development. Their three productions- Le nozze di Figaro (1786), Don 
Giovanni (1787), and Cost fan tutte (1790)-belong to opera buffa, one of the 
lightest and, supposedly, most ephemeral of genres; yet they have survived 
triumphantly. Together with Mozart's German operas Die Entfiihrung aus dem 
Serail (1782) and Die Zauberflote (1791), they form the earliest group of 
compositions to establish themselves within the standard repertoire of Grand 
Opera. Indeed, within that repertoire of some thirty items they are matched in 
quantity and unending popularity only by the operas of Wagner and Verdi. Da 
Ponte proved an ideal partner. A fugitive from his native Venice, where he had 
been born in the ghetto, he did not take his conversion and his holy orders too 
seriously. He wrote the text of Don Giovanni from the heart.- (See Appendix 
III, p. 1278.) 

In the absence of sound-recording [sound], there have been several literary 
attempts to recapture the extraordinary ambience of Mozart's music-making. 
Sixty years after Mozart's death, for example, the poet Eduard Morike (1804- 
75) did so by means of a short novella, Mozart auf der Reise nach Prag (1851). 
He recounts an imaginary encounter which the composer might well have had 
with the sort of cultivated people who made up his most enthusiastic audiences. 
Wolfgang and Constanze are travelling towards Prague through the pine-clad 
hills of the Bohemian forest when they spy the castle of the Counts von 
Schinzberg. Wolfgang is caught red-handed when he carelessly plucks a fruit 
from an orange tree in the castle's park. But he is rewarded with an invitation to 
dinner. After dinner he sits down to play at the piano and recounts, with musical 
illustrations, how he composed the finale of Don Giovanni. 

Without more ado, he put out the candles in the two candelabra standing beside him, and that terrifying air 
-Di rider finirai pria dell'aurora-rang through the deathly stillness of the room... From distant starry 
spheres, the silver trumpet notes seem to fall through the blue night, to pierce the soul with the icy tremor of 
doom. 

Chi va la. Who goes there? 

Give an answer-One hears Don Giovanni demand. 


Then the voice rings out afresh, monotonous as before, bidding the impious 
youth to leave the dead in peace.. .- 

Nor have the Czechs forgotten the brief days when Mozart graced their 
country. A contemporary Czech poet uses an evening at the Villa Bertramka as a 
springboard for reflections on unattainable paradise: 

A kdyz pocal hrat 

a copanek mu poskakoval po zadech 
prestaly sumet i lastury 
a nasta vily sva rozkosna ouska... 

(And when he began to play I and his pigtail to dance on his back I even the sea- 
shells ceased humming I and pricked up their delicate ears. I Why did they not 
lock the door then? I Why not unharness the horses from the coach? I He 
departed so soon.)- 

The Prague which Mozart loved was reaching a peak of splendour that few 
European cities could rival. It was the second city of the Habsburg domains, and 
had recently undergone five or six decades of unparalleled architectural 
reconstruction. The elegant neo-classical Tyl Theatre, only four years old, where 
Don Giovanni was performed, was just one of many magnificent new public 
buildings. The Thun Palace (1727), now the British Embassy, where the Mozarts 
stayed during their first visit in 1787, was just one of a score of sumptuous 
aristocratic residences of recent date, including those of Colleredo-Mansfeld, 
Goltz-Kinsky, Clam-Gallas, Caretto-Millesimo, and Lobkowitz-Schwarzenberg. 
The basilica of St Nicholas (1755), where Mozart's Mass in C was performed in 
the week after his departure, was one of a dozen Baroque churches designed by 
the Diezenhofers, father and son. The Carolinum (completed 1718) housed the 
university complex, the Clementinum (completed 1715) the Jesuit church and 
library. 

Most importantly, each of the city's four main historic centres had recently 
been enclosed, embellished, and united into a harmonious whole. Hradcany, 
Prague's ancient Castle Hill on the left bank of the Vltava, containing St Vitus' 
Cathedral (1344) and the Vladislavsky Sal (1502) of the Jagiellons, had been 
surrounded in 1753-75 by the high walls of Pacassi's imposing offices. The 
Mala strana or Lesser City, at the foot of Hradcany, was adorned by a new 
episcopal palace (1765). The ancient Karliiv Most or Charles Bridge (1357) 


which links the city's two sides, had been adorned along its 660-m length by a 
stunning series of religious and historical statues, the streets of the old city on 
the right bank, still dominated by the Tynsky chram and the City Hall, had been 
revitalized by much renovation. They were enlivened, as always, by the hourly 
spectacle of the city clock where Christ and the apostles led a procession brought 
up in the rear by Death, the Turk, the miser, the fool, and the cock, and by the 
chimes of the Loretto carillon (1694). The Charter of United Prague had been 
granted by the Emperor Joseph II as recently as 1784. 

The aristocrats whose residences graced the city and whose patronage ruled 
its music were the principal beneficiaries of Habsburg rule. They were largely 
drawn from German families who had benefited from the sequestrations of the 
native Czech nobility in the course of the Thirty Years War. The wealth of their 
estates in the prosperous Bohemian countryside supported the glitter of their life 
in town. By Mozart's time the majority of Czechs had been reduced to a 
headless, peasant nation, though a number of middle-class people, like the 
Duseks, lived on the margins of Czech and German society. 

The contrasts between rich and poor were extreme. During his first visit to 
Prague in 1771, when a sixth of Prague's population had died from famine, the 
Emperor Joseph II had been shocked: 

How shameful are the cases which have occurred in this year's famine. People have actually died, and have 
taken the last sacrament in the street ... In this city, where there is a rich Archbishop, a large cathedral 
chapter, so many abbeys and three Jesuit palaces ... there is not a single proven case where any of these 
took in even one of the miserable wretches who were lying in front of their doors.- 

Joseph II had no patience for the fossilized complacency of the Catholic 
Church. The Jesuit Order had been disbanded in the previous decade; and when 
he attained sole rule in 1780 he unleashed a flood of reforming decrees that 
threatened to undermine the most sacred pillars of the social order. Serfs were 
emancipated. Religious toleration was extended to Uniates, Orthodox, 
Protestants and Jews. Children under nine were forbidden to work. Civil 
marriage and divorce were permitted. Capital punishment was abolished. 
Freemasonry flourished. Wealth which derived from the secularization of 
ecclesiastical property was reflected in a spate of imperial and aristocratic 
architectural extravagance. 

Prague's large Jewish community were sharing in the surge of prosperity. 
They had put the last of numerous expulsions behind them in 1744-5, and in the 
1780s were reaping the fruits of the imperial Toleranzpatent. The Jewish quarter, 


renamed Jozefov in the Emperor's honour, shared in the city's extensive 
renovation. The medieval Old-New Synagogue and the Klaus Synagogue were 
both rebuilt. On the Jewish town hall, one modern clock showed the time in 
Latin numerals whilst another below it did so in Hebrew numerals. Prague's 
Jews were destined at a later date to supply the most dynamic element of 
Viennese Jewry. 

Prague's freemasons, too, basked in the glow of imperial tolerance. They 
welcomed Mozart, who was a member of the Grand Lodge of Austria in Vienna, 
as one of their own. They represented the strong reaction that was running 
against the suffocating hold of the Catholic Church over all intellectual and 
cultural affairs. 

Mozart thrived in the relaxed social climate of the 1780s, which the growth 
of the opera buffa reflected. He stmck a neutral stance towards the morals of his 
day. But the Rake's 'Reward' is too melodramatic to be taken seriously, and the 
message of his next collaboration with Da Ponte, Cosi fan tutte (All the Women 
Are At It) was judged by some to be scandalously permissive. Lines about 'the 
gaping bottom of every sweet-watered vale' were not open to too many 
interpretations. Lorenzo Da Ponte himself, a converted Jew, had earned a 
reputation not far removed from that of his friend and fellow Venetian, Giovanni 
Casanova di Seingalt (1725-98). After a lifetime of spying, lechery, and fleeing 
from justice, Casanova was passing his final years as librarian to the Count 
Waldstein at Dux (Duchcov) in northern Bohemia. He is known to have visited 
his publisher in Prague on 24 October 1787, and it is quite likely that he stayed 
on for Don Giovanni's premiere. Some critics were to suggest that he was the 
model for the Don. 

Gross libertinism had always been a strong undercurrent in the eighteenth 
century.- But given the official puritanism of Catholic Austria, it was no mean 
step to make sexual seduction the theme of public entertainment. It offended the 
moral guardians of Josephine Prague no less than it offends the guardians of 
feminist correctness today. Don Giovanni, after all, like Casanova, was a cynical 
philanderer for whom women were mere objects of desire. Casanova's own 
words are not irrelevant: 

The man who loves ... rates the pleasure which he is sure to give the loved object more highly than the 
pleasure which the object can give him in fruition. Hence, he is eager to satisfy her. Woman, whose great 
preoccupation is her own interest, cannot but rate the pleasure she will herself feel more highly than the 

r o 

pleasure she will give. Hence, she procrastinates...- 


One of Mozart's greatest qualities, however, was to place himself above the 
passions of the world around him. His scores were blithe or sublime by turns, 
even when he was oppressed by the most agonizing pains of ill health, poverty, 
and bad fortune. His music, though composed in the world, was not of it. 
Though he was highly travelled, having spent twenty years touring the courts of 
Europe, there is not the slightest trace of the politics of his day. 

In 1787 Europe was approaching the climacteric of its development over the 
previous two centuries. This was the year when the republican Constitution of 
the USA was signed, to the horror of Europe's monarchies, and when the 
American dollar began to circulate. In Britain, under the ministry of the Younger 
Pitt, world-wide imperial concerns were under discussion with the launching 
both of the impeachment of Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General of 
British India, and of the Association for the Abolition of the Slave Trade. In 
Russia, the Empress Catherine had just embarked on the latest of her campaigns 
against the Turks-to which end, in her new province of Crimea, she entertained 
her ally, the Emperor Joseph, Mozart's patron. In the Netherlands, the Stadholder 
William V had been expelled, and his wife taken hostage by the republican 
'Patriot' party. As Mozart prepared to set out for Prague, the Prussian army was 
setting out for Holland to restore the Stadholder. The Vatican was fighting the 
secular tide: Pius VI (r. 1775-99) had been barred from sending a nuncio to 
Munich, and had been refused the customary feudal homage by the King of 
Naples. In Florence he was faced by a Grand Duke who had introduced Gallican 
rules into the Tuscan Church. In France, by the time that Don Giovanni was 
performed, both the Assembly of Notables and the Parlement of Paris had been 
convened and dis missed. The King of France had been convinced of the 
country's impending bank ruptcy, and had resolved to summon the Estates- 
General, initially for July 1792. Other events, of great importance for the future, 
took place virtually unnoticed. The first practical steamboat was demonstrated. 
In August, Horace Saussure made the first ascent of Mont Blanc. Man was 
mastering Nature. 

With hindsight, the historian can see that Mozart's music was playing out 
many of the most doomed and decrepit elements of the Ancien Regime. No one 
knew at the time, but Joseph II was the penultimate occupant of the Holy Roman 
Empire. Doge Paolo Renier (r. 1779-89) was the 125th in the line of 126 doges 
of Venice. Bohemia's neighbour, Poland, had already entered the last decade of 
the last reign of its 51 sovereign kings and princes. Pope Pius VI was destined to 



die in a French revolutionary dungeon. 

In the creative arts, as always, the traditional vied with the innovative. 1787 
saw Jeremy Bentham's Defence of Usury, Goethe's Iphigenie in verse, and 
Schiller's Don Carlos. Fragonard, David, and Goya were at their easels, 
alongside Reynolds, Gainsborough, Stubbs, and Romney. Mozart's musical 
contemporaries included Haydn, Cherubini, and C. R E. Bach. 

Of course, it could be said that Don Giovanni was conceived as a brilliant, 
intuitive allegory of the judgement which awaited a corrupt and dissolute 
continent. If so, there is no such hint either in Mozart's correspondence or in the 
work itself. People had no awareness of impending catastrophe, least of all in 
France. The Marquis de Condorcet, for example, one of the most radical 
philosophes of the day, was certain of only one thing, that monarchy was 
impregnable.- An intelligent young Frenchwoman with musical inclinations 
recorded her impressions of Paris in that same era: 


The musical gatherings [at the Hotel de Rochechouart] were very distinguished. They were held once a 
week... but there were rehearsals as well. Mme Montgeroux, a famous pianist of the day, played the piano; 
an Italian singer from the Opera sang the tenor parts; Mandini, another Italian, sang the bass; Mme de 
Richelieu was the prima donna; I sang the contralto, M de Duras the baritone; the choruses were sung by 
other good amateurs. Viotti accompanied us on the violin. We executed the most difficult finales in this 
way. Everyone took the greatest pains, and Viotti was excessively severe... I doubt if there exists anywhere 
the ease, harmony, good manners, and absence of all pretension which was to be found then in all the great 
houses of Paris... 


Amid all these pleasures, we were drawing near to the month of May 1789, laughing and dancing our way 
to the precipice. Thinking people were content to talk of abolishing all the abuses. France, they said, was 
about to be reborn. The word 'revolution' was never uttered.- 

* 

^1 July 1690 (Old Style) = 11 July 1690 (New Style). Owing to confusion over the changed calendar, 
or perhaps over the Protestants' second victory of July 1690 at Aughrim, 'The Boyne' has come to be 
celebrated traditionally in Northern Ireland as a national holiday held on 12 July.

REVOLUTIO 

A Continent in Turmoil c.1770-1815 


There is a universal quality about the French Revolution which does not pertain 
to any of Europe's many other convulsions. Indeed, this was the event which 
gave the word 'Revolution' its full, modern meaning: that is, no mere political 
upheaval, but the complete overthrow of a system of government together with 
its social, economic and cultural foundations. Nowadays the history books are 
filled with 'revolutions'. There have been attempts, for example, to turn 
England's Civil War into the 'English Revolution', and still more attempts to 
upgrade the Russian Revolution into the third round of a universal series. 
There's the Roman Revolution, the Scientific Revolution, the Military 
Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, the American Revolution, even, in recent 
years, the Sexual Revolution. Not all of them deserve the title. 

But in 1789 there was reason to believe that changes were taking place 
which would affect people far beyond France and far beyond mere politics. Paris 
was the capital of a dominant power, and the centre of an international culture. 
The revolutionaries had inherited the Enlightenment's belief in the universal 
abstraction of man. They felt that they were acting on behalf of all people 
everywhere, pitting themselves against universal tyranny. Their most noble 
monument was not some parochial pronouncement on the rights of the French 
but a ringing declaration on the Rights of Man (see below). 'Sooner or later,' 
Mirabeau told the National Assembly, 








the influence of a nation that ... has reduced the art of living to the simple notions of liberty and equality- 
notions endowed with irresistible charm for the human heart, and propagated in all the countries of the 
world-the influence of such a nation will undoubtedly conquer the whole of Europe for Truth, Moderation 
and Justice, not immediately perhaps, not in a single day ... 


This was the sort of sentiment which has inspired the label of 'Europe's first 
Revolution' in place of something that was exclusively French.- 

Foreigners shared the same vivid sense of involvement. A young English 
enthusiast, later to repent, was to write ecstatically: 'Bliss was it in that dawn to 
be alive.' An elder statesman could bewail: 'The age of chivalry is gone. That of 
sophisters, economists and calculators has succeeded; and the glory of Europe is 
extinguished for ever.' 'Here and now', remarked the leading writer of the age 
having watched the Battle of Valmy, 'a new era in the world begins.'- Historians, 
whether for or against, have invariably resorted to strong words. Thomas 
Carlyle, appalled by what he dubbed 'sansculottism', called the French 
Revolution 'the frightfullest thing ever born of Time'.- Jules Michelet, 
harbouring the opposite feelings, began: 'I define the Revolution: the advent of 
the Law, the resurrection of Right, and the reaction of Justice.'- 



Map 20. 
Europe, 1810 


The French Revolution plunged Europe into the most profound and 
protracted crisis which it had ever known. It consumed an entire generation in its 
tumults, its wars, its disturbing innovations. From the epicentre in Paris, it sent 
shock waves into the furthest recesses of the Continent. From the shores of 
Portugal to the depths of Russia, from Scandinavia to Italy, the shocks were 
followed by soldiers in bright uniforms with a blue, white and red cockade in 
their hats, and with 'Fiberte, Egalite, Fraternite' on their lips. For its partisans, 
the Revolution promised liberation from the traditional oppressions enshrined in 
monarchy, nobility, and organized religion. For its opponents, it was 
synonymous with the dark forces of mob rule and terror. For France, it spelt the 
start of a modern national identity. For Europe as a whole, it provided an object 
lesson in the danger of replacing one form of tyranny with another. It began with 










hopes of limited peaceful change; 'it ended amidst promises of resistance to any 
form of change whatsoever'. In the short run, it met defeat; in the long run, in 
the realm of social and political ideas, it made, and continues to make, a major 
and a lasting contribution. 

The pageant of the Revolution contains personalities and cliches that are 
known to every European schoolchild. The central parade of revolutionary 
leaders-Mirabeau, Danton, Marat, Robespierre, and Bonaparte-is 
complemented by the long line of their opponents and victims: by scenes of 
Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette on the scaffold, of Charlotte Corday, the 
peasant girl who murdered Marat in his bath 'to save a hundred thousand men': 
of the emigre Due d'Enghien, seized and executed on Bonaparte's orders. It is 
surrounded by a host of auxiliary figures of colour and enterprise-by radical 
Tom Paine, the exiled English philosopher who 'saw Revolution on two 
continents', by the inimitable Charles de Talleyrand-Perigord, ci-devant bishop, 
'the irreverend Reverend of Autun', survivor supreme; by Antoine Fouquier- 
Tinville, the ice-cold prosecutor-general. In every European country it is 
accompanied by a vast gallery of heroes and villains, ranged for or against-in 
Britain by Nelson dying on the deck of HMS Victory, in Germany by Scharnhost 
and Gneisenau, in Austria by the patriot-martyr Andreas Hofer, in Poland by the 
noble Marshal Poniatowski riding his white horse to a watery grave, in Russia by 
the indomitable Kutuzov trudging doggedly through the snow. In European art 
and literature it is enriched by a series of unforgettable tableaux in words and 
paint, from Goya's Desastres de la Guerra or David's portraits of Napoleon to 
Stendhal's La Chartreuse de Parme, Dickens's A Tale of Two Cities, 
Mickiewicz's Pan Tadeusz, or Tolstoy's War and Peace. 

Any account of the revolutionary era must look successively at the causes, at 
the revolutionary events themselves, and at the consequences. Every 
chronological narrative must begin with the prelude of pre-revolutionary 
ferment. It must examine how moderate demands led to extreme changes, and 
how the conflict in France led to Continental wars. The crisis starts with the first 
waning of the Enlightenment in the 1770s, and closes with the Congress of 
Vienna which opened in 1814.

Prelude 



The causes of the French Revolution are the subject of endless debate. One can 
distinguish the setting (which sometimes threatens to become the whole of 
previous history), the profound causes, or deep-laid sources of instability, and 
the immediate events or 'sparks' which ignited the barrel. The setting, in the last 
quarter of the eighteenth century, consisted of a generalized but deepening 
climate of unease right across Europe. The changes that generated the unease 
were not concentrated in France; but France was both a participant and a 
witness. France, facing political paralysis and financial stress, proved less 
capable of standing the stresses than her neighbours. 'The revolution [was] 
imminent in almost all of Europe. It broke out in France, because there the 
Ancien Regime was more worn out, more detested, and more easily destroyed 
than elsewhere. '- 

On the political front, the major earthquake occurred across the Atlantic. 
Great Britain, which the philosophes had always regarded as the most stable and 
moderate of countries, was plunged into a war with its American colonists who, 
with French help, determined to break free of British rule. But the War of 
American Independence (1776-83) had important repercussions in Europe. For 
one thing, it pushed France's financial crisis towards the brink. It also made 
Frenchmen, and others, consider their own predicament: if poor old bumbling 
George III was to be classed as a tyrant, how should one classify the other 
monarchs of Europe? If the Americans could rebel against a 3d. duty on tea, 
what possible justification could there be for the massive imposts under which 
most Europeans groaned? If the USA had to be created because Americans had 
no representation in the British Parliament, what should all those Europeans 
think whose countries did not even possess a parliament? American 
constitutional thought was magnificently simple and universally relevant: 

We hold these truths to be sacred and undeniable: that all men are created equal and independent, that from 
their equal creation they derive rights inherent and inalienable, among which are the preservation of life and 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.- 

Europe's participation in the American Revolution is formally acknowledged 
with statues and monuments. The American factor in Europe's Revolution is not 
always acknowledged so readily. But in the dozen years which separated the 
Declaration of Independence on 4 July 1776 from the inauguration of the first 
President, George Washington, on 29 April 1789, it was the creation of the USA 
which brought debates about modern government to a head. 


Tom Paine (1737-1809), a Norfolk Quaker from Thetford, was the living 
link between Europe and America. 'Radical Tom' devoted himself to the 
American cause after being outlawed from England. His Common Sense (1776) 
was the most effective tract of the American Revolution; his The Rights of Man 
(1791) was to be one of the most radical responses to the French Revolution. He 
was to sit in the French Convention, and to escape the guillotine by a whisker. 
His The Age of Reason (1793), a deist tract written in firebrand prose, caused a 
scandal. 'My country is the world/ he wrote, 'and my religion is to do good.' 

In Eastern Europe, the three great empires were digesting the first Partition 
of Poland (see Chapter VIII). There was relief that war had been avoided; but the 
clouds of propaganda could not conceal the facts of violence. What is more, in 
Poland-Lithuania itself the Partition only inflamed resentments against Russian 
hegemony. The strains of Polish Enlightenment were leading inexorably to a 
confrontation with the Tsarina. The Russian sphere of influence was moving in 
parallel with that of France towards a collision between the 'tyrants' and the 
'friends of liberty'. It was no accident that the revolutionary era would 
eventually culminate in a titanic clash between France and Russia. 

Beyond or beneath everyday politics, there were indications that deep forces 
invisible on the ordered surface of late eighteenth-century Europe were 
somehow getting out of control. One source of anxiety was technological: the 
appearance of power-driven machines with immense destructive as well as 
constructive potential. The second source was social: a growing awareness of 
'the masses', the realization that the teeming millions, largely excluded from 
polite society, might take their fate into their own hands. The third source was 
intellectual: a rising concern both in literature and in philosophy with the 
irrational in human conduct. Historians are pressed to decide whether these 
developments were related phenomena: whether the so-called Industrial 
Revolution, the collectivist strand in social thought, and the beginnings of 
Romanticism were connected parts of one coherent process or not; whether they 
were causes of the revolutionary upheaval, or merely its companions and 
contributors. 

The Industrial Revolution is a blanket term which is widely used to describe a 
range of technological and organizational changes that were considerably wider 
than the single best-known element: the invention of power-driven machinery. 
What is more, the term has come to refer, after immense historical debates, to 



merely one stage in a still more complex chain of changes-now called 
'Modernization'-that did not begin to have its full effect until the following 
century (see pp. 764-82). Even so, there are a dozen elements of 'proto¬ 
industrialization' that must be taken into consideration; they include farming, 
mobile labour, steam power, machines, mines, metallurgy, factories, towns, 
communications, finance, and demography. 

Scientific farming was one of the obsessions of the Enlightenment, and of 
the physiocrats in particular. From its initial, rationalizing stage, it progressed to 
the point where horse-driven (though not yet power-driven) machinery was 
creating the potential for greatly accelerated production. An English farmer from 
Hungerford, Jethro Tull (1674-1741), had advertised a machine-drill in his 
Horse-Hoeing Husbandry, published as long ago as 1703; the steel-tipped 
Rotherham ploughshare came on to the market in 1803. Over the intervening 
century, agricultural experimentation had raged. But progress was painfully 
slow, the average level of agricultural production was dictated, not by the tempo 
of innovations, but by the pace of the average farmer, [cap-ag] 

As farms increased their food production, more people could be fed from the 
produce of the same land. Men once used to work the fields could be released for 
other forms of employment. The rise in agricultural efficiency aided a rise in the 
birth rate, and stood to create a pool of surplus labour, at least in those countries 
where peasants were free to leave the land. Yet a supply of unskilled peasants 
provided only half an answer. Industry was to need skills as well as manpower. 
The most favoured locations would be found where artisan traditions were most 
developed. 

Steam-power had been known since antiquity. But it had never been given 
any practical application until it was harnessed in 1711 by Thomas Newcomen 
(1663-1729) to a clumsy great engine for pumping flood-water from a mine in 
Devon. The steam-engine was immensely improved by James Watt (1736- 
1819), a Scots instrument-maker from Glasgow, who in 1763 was called in to 
repair a model of Newcomen's monster, and perfected the condenser. From then 
on, the different sorts of machinery to which the motive power of steam could be 
applied seemed limitless. 

Machinery had been used ever since the water-mill and the printing-press. In 
the hands of the eighteenth-century clock-makers it had reached a high level of 
precision. But the prospect of a power source far more forceful than hand, water, 
or spring inspired a rash of inventions, all initially in the realm of textiles. Three 



Lancashire men, James Hargreaves (1720-78) of Blackburn, Richard Arkwright 
(1732-92) of Preston, and Samuel Crompton (1753-1827) of Hall'ith' Wood, 
Bolton, built respectively the spinning jenny (1767), the spinning frame (1768), 
and the spinning mule (1779). The jenny was suitable only for hand use in 
cottages; the frame and mule proved suitable for steam traction in factories. A 

new level of sophistication was reached in France with the silk loom (1804) of 
[JACQUARD], 

Steam-power and machines, however, could not be put into widespread use 
unless coal-the most efficient fuel for raising steam-could be mined on a 
much expanded scale. This was achieved through a number of innovations, 
including underground pumps, Humphry Davy's safety lamp (1816), and the use 
of gunpowder for blasting. Machines, equally, which had to be made of hardened 
steel, could not be built in quantity unless the production of iron and steel could 
be expanded. This was achieved through a series of improvements, including 
those introduced at the Carron ironworks in Scotland (1760) and Henry Cort's 
patents for the puddling and rolling of steel (1783-4). 


JACQUARD 

In 1804 Joseph-Marie Jacquard (1752-1834), textile engineer of Lyons, 
perfected a loom which could weave cloth into any number of predetermined 
patterns, using sets of punched cards to control woof and shuttle. In textile 
history, Jacquard's loom was a major advance on the earlier inventions of 
Arkwright, Hargreaves, and Crompton. In the wider history of technology, it 
was an important step in the direction of automated machinery, the 
predecessor of all sorts of contraptions, from the pianola and the barrel- 
organ to punched-card data storage systems. Most significantly, perhaps, it 
established the dual principle on which computers would one day operate. 
The frame, and other working parts of Jacquard's loom, were the 'hardware', 
the sets of punched cards were the 'software'. 1 


The concentration of industrial workers under one roof, in a 'factory', long 






preceded the arrival of power-driven machinery. ('Factory' is a shortened form 
of 'manufactory', meaning 'production by hand'.) Silk factories, carpet factories, 
and porcelain factories had been common enough throughout the eighteenth 
century. But the installation of heavy plant, requiring constant servicing and 
regular supplies of fuel and raw materials, turned factory organization from an 
option into a necessity. The sight of the 'dark satanic mills'-vast, gaunt 
structures the size of a royal palace, set incongruously beside some little stream 
whose water they consumed, and belching forth pungent black smoke from a 
chimney the size of Trajan's Column-came first to the textile settlements of 
Lancashire and Yorkshire. The appearance of factories caused the sudden growth 
of new urban centres. The archetype lay in Manchester, capital of Lancashire's 
cotton industry. The first British Census of 1801 showed that Manchester had 
grown tenfold in a quarter of a century, from the proportions of a single parish to 
a town of 75,275 registered citizens. If population was drawn to new factory 
towns, it is also true that factories were drawn to the few large centres of existing 
population. Cities such as London or Paris, with a large pool of artisans and 
paupers, were attractive targets for employers seeking labour. 

Inland communications were crucial; they had to be rendered as cheap and as 
effective as maritime trade. Huge loads of coal, iron, and other commodities 
such as cotton, wool, or clay needed to be moved from mines and ports to the 
factory. Manufactured goods needed to be delivered to distant markets. River, 
road, and rail transport were all involved. Once again, the greatest incentives 
arose in Britain. In 1760 the Duke of Bridgewater's engineer, James Brindley 
(1716-72), improved the scope of earlier canals by building a marvellous 
waterway that crossed Lancashire's River Irwell on the Barton Aqueduct (1760). 
In 1804, at Merthyr Tydfil in South Wales, the Cornish engineer Richard 
Trevithick (1771-1833) coaxed a high-pressure steam locomotive into pulling 
coal wagons along a short railway. It proved more expensive than horses. In 
1815 J. L. McAdam (1756-1836) gave his name (universally misspelled) to a 
system of road construction using a chipped-stone base and a tar surface. 

Nothing could happen without money. Immense amounts of money were 
needed from investors willing to take immense risks to make immense but 
uncertain gains. Such money could only be forthcoming in countries where other 
forms of pre-industrial enterprise had accumulated a ready store of venture 
capital. 

Demographic factors were also critical. It is not hard to understand the 



workings of the demographic motor where the processes of the Industrial 
Revolution generated an increase in population, and an increasing population 
encouraged the processes of the Industrial Revolution. The difficulty is to see 
how the motor was initially primed and fired. Certainly, in France, there was a 
long period of demographic impotence, where la grande nation of Europe, 
twenty million strong, proved incapable of increasing the population levels of 
the last three centuries. Great Britain, in contrast, enjoyed many advantages: 
prosperous farmers, mobile labourers, skilled artisans, ready supplies of coal and 
iron, an extensive network of trade, small internal distances, commercial 
entrepreneurs, a rising population, and political stability. It was decades before 
anyone else could begin to compete (see Appendix III, p. 1294). 

Collectivism-the conviction that society as a whole may have rights and 
interests-was not well articulated in this period. It ran contrary to the 
individualism which had been strongly emphasized since the Renaissance and 
the Protestant Reformation. But it was an important development. It was implicit 
both in the idea of the modern state, which stressed the commonality of all its 
subjects, and in the discussions of the physiocrats and economists about the 
workings of the socio-political organism. It was explicit in Rousseau's concept 
of the general will, and was a cardinal principle with the utilitarians. It may well 
have been encouraged by the mobs and crowds in Europe's growing cities, by 
the sight of industrial workers pouring through the factory gates. At any rate, the 
power of the collective, whether ruly or unruly, could impress the imagination 
not just of philosophers but of generals, rabble-rousers, and poets. 

Romanticism thrived on the growing tensions. After the initial inroads in 
Germany, the next generation was swelled by poets and publicists in England- 
notably by the trio of young Lakeland poets, Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772- 
1834), William Wordsworth (1770-1850), and Robert Southey (1774-1843), and 
by the astonishing William Blake (1757-1827), poet, engraver, illustrator. 
German Romanticism was still productive. Goethe's friend, Friedrich von 
Schiller (1759-1805), published his historical dramas Wallenstein (1799), Maria 
Stuart (1800), and Wilhelm Tell (1804) at a time when Goethe had moved off in 
another direction. But by the time that Wordsworth climbed the cliffs at Tintern 
in 1798, it was the English Romantics who were taking the lead. Europe was 
already plunged into the horrors of war and revolution. Mankind seemed to be 
irrational to the point of self-destruction. The world was ever more 
incomprehensible. The untrammelled rule of logic and reason had come to an 
end: 



Ah! Well a day! What evil looks 
Had I from old and young! 

Instead of the cross, the albatross 
Around my neck was hung.- 

* * * 

Oh rose, Thou art sick! 

The invisible worm 
That flies in the night 
Hath found out Thy bed 
Of crimson joy; 

And his dark secret love 
Doth Thy life destroy.- 

Here, if ever, were Freudian verses almost a hundred years before Freud, 

[FREUOE] 

Defiant young rebels were staking out the frontiers of Romanticism still 
further. In 1797 in Germany, Friedrich von Hardenberg (Novalis, 1772-1801) 
composed the mystical Hymnen an die Nacht, in which, like Dante for Beatrice, 
he sublimated his passion for a long-lost love. In 1799 Friedrich Schlegel (1772- 
1829), younger brother of the translator of Shakespeare, Dante, and Calderon, 
wrote the scandalous novel Lucinde which suggested that love of beauty should 
be the supreme ideal. In France, Fran^ois-Rene Chateaubriand (1768-1843) 
published the Essai sur les revolutions (1797) and his Genie du Christianisme 
(1801) in the teeth of contemporary conventions. In 1812 in England, the 
outrageous Lord George Byron (1788-1824) published Childe Harold's 
Pilgrimage, which was to launch a Europe-wide cult. 

Important, too, were the salons and centres which propagated the new ideas. 
The Jena circle of the Schlegel brothers was influential in Germany. But pride of 
place must go to Germaine Necker (Mme de Stael, 1766-1817), daughter of 
Louis XVI's chief minister and one of the most effective purveyors of romantic 
ideas. An author in her own right, Mme de Stael held court, first on the Rue du 
Bac in Paris and then in exile, to all the literati of the day. Her novel Delphine 
(1803) had feminist leanings; Corinne (1807) was a manifesto of passion; De 
VAllemagne (1810) was a tract that made the world of German Romanticism 
accessible to France. 

Reason was not tamed, however, until the philosophers themselves turned 


against it. Vico's earlier divergences from the Enlightenment were pursued in the 
unlikely setting of East Prussia. Immanuel Kant (1724-1804), undoubtedly a 
giant among philosophers, bridged the gap between Reason and Romanticism. A 
pietist, a bachelor, and a creature of pedantic routine, he was peculiarly insulated 
from the stirring events of his lifetime. He never once left the environs of his 
native Konigsberg, and made himself all the more inaccessible by writing dense, 
contorted, professorial prose. ('Coleridge's Kantian phase', writes one 
commentator, 'did not improve his verse.'-) None the less, Kant's three Critiques 
presented a body of ideas to which almost all subsequent philosophers claim to 
be indebted. 


FREUDE 


In 1785, in the village of Gohlis near Leipzig, Friedrich Schiller composed 

I An die Freude, 'Ode to Joy'. It was a paean to the spiritual liberation which 
overwhelmed him after a hopeless love affair and a winter of penury in 
Mannheim. It had political as well as personal overtones: a persistent rumour 
maintains that the original title was 'Hymn to Freedom': 


Freude, schoner Gotterfunken, 
Tochter aus Elysium, 
wir betreten feuertrunken, 
Himmlische, dein Heiligtum. 
Deine Zauber bindet wieder, 
was die Mode streng geteilt; 
alle Menschen werden Briider, 
Wo dein sanfter Fliigel weilt. 

Seid umschlungen, Millionen! 
Diesen KuE der ganzen Welt! 
Briider-iiberm Sternenzelt 
MuE ein lieber Vater wohnen * 1 


Joy, brilliant spark of the gods, 
daughter of Elysium, heavenly being, 
we enter, drunk with fire, 
your holy sanctuary. 

Your magic reunites 
what was split by convention, 
and all men become brothers 
where your gentle wings are spread. 


Be embraced, you millions! 

This kiss for all the world! 
Brothers, above the starry canopy 
must surely dwell a loving father. 


Seven years later the young Beethoven publicly stated his intention of 
setting the Ode to music. He was to brood about it for more than thirty years. 

Beethoven conceived the idea of a grandiose 'German Symphony' some 





time in 1817. He felt that it might culminate in a choral finale. His early 
notes mentioned an Adagio Cantique, 'a religious song in a Symphony in the 
old modes ... In the Adagio the text to be a Greek mythos (or) Cantique 
Ecclesiastique. In the Allegro a Bacchus festival'. 2 Only in June or July 
1823 did he turn definitively to the Ode, and then with constant misgivings. 
During those years, bitter and despondent from advancing deafness, he 
triumphed over his adversity through the Missa Solemnis and the wonderful 
mn of piano sonatas, Op. 109-11. 

Yet the Symphony No. 9 (Choral) in D minor (Op. 125) was to scale the 
heights of intellectual invention and emotional daring still further. After a 
brief, whispering prologue, the first movement, allegro ma non troppo, is 
launched by the extraordinary sound of the whole orchestra playing the 
descending chord of D minor in unison. The second movement, molto 
vivace, 'the most divine of Scherzos', is punctuated by moments when the 
music stops completely, only to restart with redoubled energy. The third 
movement, adagio, is built round two intertwined melodies of great nobility. 

The transition to the finale was contrived by bracketing a disjointed 
recital of the preceding subjects within two outbursts of the famous 
cacophony or 'clamour'. This, in its turn, is interrupted by the ringing appeal 
of the bass voice: 'O Freunde, nicht diese Toene!' (Oh friends, no more of 
these tones! Let us sing something full of gladness!) Shortly, a new motif 
steals in from the wind section. Repeated in the triumphant key of D major, 
the key of trumpets, it is the simplest and yet most powerful of all 
symphonic melodies. In a line of fifty-six notes, it possesses only three 
which are not consecutive. It is the tune which will carry Beethoven's 
rearrangement of Schiller's stanzas: 



The dazzling complexities which follow drive performers and listeners 
into the outer realms of effort and imagination. An augmented orchestra is 
joined by a full choir and four soloists. The quartet sings the theme with two 
variations. The tenor sings 'Glad, glad as suns through ether wending' to the 
strains of a military march with Turkish percussion. An orchestral interlude 
in double fugue leads to the thundering chorus 'Oh, ye millions, I embrace 
you!'. The soloists converse with the chorus over Schiller's opening lines 



before another double fugue pushes the sopranos to sustain a top A for 
twelve endless measures. The coda sees the soloists blending into a sort of 
'universal round', a passage of florid polyphony, and a last dash into a 
diminished version of the main theme. At the end, the words 'Daughter of 
Elysium, Joy, O Joy, the God-descended' are repeated maestoso before the 
final, affirmative drop from A to D. 3 

Despite a commission from the London Philharmonic Society, 'the 
Ninth' received its first performance in the Theatre of the Kaerntnertor in 
Vienna on 7 May 1824. The composer conducted. Unhearing, he totally lost 
control; he was still conducting when the music ceased. He was turned round 
by one of the players so that he could see the applause. 

Beethoven was always seen as a universal genius. During the Second World 
War, the opening bars of his Fifth Symphony were used to announce BBC 
broadcasts to Nazi-occupied Europe. A century and a half after his death, his 
rendering of An der Freude was adopted as the official anthem of the 
European Community. The words, which were taken to celebrate the 
universal brotherhood of Man, linked a pre-nation-alist with a post¬ 
nationalist age. The melody was thought to fit the fervent hopes of a 
continent emerging from the cacophonous clamour of two world wars. 


The Kritik der reinen Vernunft (Critique of Pure Reason, 1781) denies that 
rationalist metaphysics can be accepted as a perfect science like mathematics. It 
insists that every phenomenon existing outside time and space has its own 
inscrutable source of being. Each such source was called das Ding-an-sich, 'the 
thing-in-itself'. 'I had to abolish knowledge', he wrote apologetically, 'in order 
to make room for faith.' Reason is to be complemented by belief and 
imagination. The Kritik der praktischen Vernunft (Critique of Practical Reason, 
1788) is a treatise of moral philosophy, elaborating Kant's theory of the 
'categorical imperative'. It is sympathetic to traditional Christian ethics and 
stresses duty as the supreme criterion of moral conduct. The Kritik der 
Urteilskraft (Critique of Evaluation, 1790) is a treatise on aesthetics. It makes 
the famous distinction between Verstand (intellect) and Vernunft (reason) as 
instruments of judgement. Kant argues that art should serve morality and should 
avoid the portrayal of nasty objects. 'Beauty has no value except in the service 




of man.' 


Kant was deeply interested in the philosophy of history. Like his 
contemporary, Gibbon, he was impressed by the 'tissue of folly', the 'puerile 
vanity', and the 'thirst for destruction' which filled the historical record. At the 
same time, he strove to find sense amidst the chaos. He found it in the idea that 
conflict was a teacher which would extend rationality from a few noble 
individuals to the conduct of all mankind. He wrote in his Concept of Universal 
History (1784), 'Men may wish for concord, but Nature knows better what is 
good for the species. [Nature] wants discord.' Kant's politics advocated 
republicanism. He welcomed the French Revolution though not the Terror, 
denouncing both paternal government and hereditary privilege. In Zum ewigen 
Frieden (On Perpetual Peace, 1795) he called for the creation of a 
Weltbiirgertum or 'World Community' which would commit itself to universal 
disarmament and bury the Balance of Power. None of these views was 
particularly fitting for a subject of the King of Prussia, [genug] 

J. G. Herder (1744-1803), born at Mohrungen (Morag), started his career as 
an enthusiastic reader of Rousseau, giving up a job at Riga in order to sail to 
France. He later settled in Weimar, under Goethe's patronage. His fertile mind 
produced a whole crop of original thoughts about culture, history, and art. He 
made an anti-rationalist contribution to the epistemological debate, propounding 
the idea that perception is a function of the total personality. In his Ideen zur 
Philosophie der Geschichte der Menschheit (1784-91), he developed Vico's 
cyclical concept of the birth, growth, and death of civilizations, but conceiving 
of progress as something much more complex than mere linear advancement. In 
his own estimation, however, his most important undertaking lay in a lifelong 
devotion to the collection and study of folklore and folksong, both German and 
foreign. Here was a subject that would play a central role not just in Romantic 
literature but in the whole story of national-consciousness (see pp. 816-17). 


GENUG 

When Immanuel Kant died at Konigsberg on 12 February 1804, his last 
word was Genug (Enough). Never a truer word is spoken than in death. 1

All the arts responded to the shifting climate. In music, both Mozart and Haydn 
stayed devoted to the classical canon of orderly form, delicacy, and harmony. 
But Beethoven, who had quickly mastered the classical conventions, moved 
steadily on into the musical equivalent of revolutionary storm and stress. He had 
already reached it by the time of his Symphony no. 3, the 'Eroica' (1805), 
originally dedicated to Napoleon. Carl Maria von Weber (1786-1826), sometime 
opera-master at Dresden, was to become a stereotype of the Romantic artist. His 
first successful opera, Das Waldmadchen (1800), presented the touching story of 
a dumb girl communing with the mysteries of the forest. The melodic genius of 
Franz Schubert (1797-1828) was cut short, like his Unfinished Symphony, by 
disease and an untimely death, but not before he had compiled a matchless 
oeuvre of over 600 songs. Alongside the acknowledged masters, there was a 




strong supporting cast of almost forgotten names such as J. K. Dussek (1761- 
1812), Muzio Clementi (1752-1832), M. K. Oginski (1765-1833), J. N. 
Hummel (1778-1837), John Field (1782-1837), or Maria Szymanowska (1789- 
1831)-the latter unusual in her day as a female performer and composer. 

In painting, the appeal of neo-classicism was only partially overtaken. The 
most influential of French painters, Jacques-Louis David (1748-1825), never 
ceased to address classical subjects. But Romantic pathos crept into even early 
pictures such as Saint Roch (1780), inspired by the plague at Marseilles; and it 
furnished an important element in his heroic portrayal of the Napoleonic saga. 
Yet the most radical innovations appeared elsewhere. In Germany, the portraitist 
R O. Runge (1777-1810) sought 'symbols of the eternal rhythm of the universe'. 
In England, the animals of George Stubbs (1724-1806) passed from their 
classical pastures of utter calm and restraint to agitated scenes such as the much 
admired Horse Attacked by a Lion. J. M. W. Turner (1775-1851) took the first 
steps along the road which would lead him all the way to Impressionism. He 
visited Switzerland for the first time in 1802, and painted The Reichenbach 
Falls. From the start he was drawn to the tempestuous powers of Nature, 
especially at sea. His contemporary, the landscapist John Constable (1776- 
1837), brought a gentler temperament but no less talent to the study of Nature's 
moods. William Blake, as illustrator, entered the world of fantasy and the 
supernatural. His illustrations of Dante pointed to a Romantic taste that spread 
across Europe. In Spain, Francisco Goya (1746-1828), royal painter from 1789, 
found his metier recording all the nightmares and horrors of war and civil strife. 
'The Sleep of Reason', he said about one of his pictures, 'engenders monsters.'- 

For a long time historians sought the roots of the Revolution primarily in the 
intellectual and political conflicts of the preceding age. The philosophes were 
seen to have undermined the ideological foundations of the Ancien Regime, 
whilst the ministers of Louis XVI-Turgot, 1774-6, Necker, 1776-81 and 1788- 
9, Calonne, 1783-7, and Archbishop Lomenie de Brienne, 1787-8-led France 
to national bankruptcy. Historians saw the calling of the Estates-General and the 
subsequent storming of the Bastille as the straightforward consequence of 
popular grievances, of excesses perpetrated by court, church, and nobility, and of 
reform pursued 'too little, too late'. Burke suspected a conspiracy of the 'swinish 
multitude'; Thiers, writing within memory of the Revolution, stressed the 
injustices of absolute government; Michelet stressed the miseries of 'the people'. 

An important finesse to the debate was provided by Alexis de Tocqueville 


(1805-59). In his Ancien Regime et la Revolution (1856) he showed that the 
dynamic of reform and revolution was no straightforward matter. Many aspects 
of government were actually improving under Louis XVI, who had always been 
genuinely committed to reform. 'The social order destroyed by a revolution,' he 
wrote, 'is almost always better than that which preceded it; and experience 
shows that the most dangerous moment for a bad government is generally that in 
which it sets about reform ...'- The slightest acts of arbitrary power under 
Louis XVI seemed harder to endure 'than all the despotism of Louis XIV.'- 

More recent research has given precision to many of these assertions. It has 
revealed the role of the Paris Parlement in blocking the King's reforms, of the 
Parlement's pamphleteers in spreading the ideas of the philosophes, and of 
ideology as a force in its own right. One study even claims that Necker had 
succeeded in balancing the budget during his first ministry. This would suggest 
that the financial crisis following the War of American Independence, which 
precipitated the calling of the Estates-General, was the result not of systemic 
collapse but of simple mismanagement.- 

At one stage in the debate, prime emphasis was placed on the economic and 
social problems which were judged to underlie the political upheaval. Marx had 
been an historical sociologist, who belonged to a vintage for whom the French 
Revolution remained the focus of all historical discussion; and many Marxists 
and quasi-Marxists followed suit. In the 1930s C. E. Labrousse published 
quantitative evidence both for cyclical agrarian depressions in late eighteenth- 
century France and for an acute food shortage and price catastrophe in 1787-9.- 
In the 1950s a long interpretative war between the followers of Lefebvre and 
Cobban only served to give prominence to their sociological preoccupations.- A 
consensus appeared to emerge about the primacy of 'bourgeois' interests. 'The 
revolution was theirs,' concluded Cobban, 'and for them at least it was a wholly 
successful revolution.'- 'The French Revolution', wrote another participant, 
'constitutes the crowning point of a long social and economic evolution which 
made the bourgeoisie the mistress of the world.'- But then the bourgeois theory 
was challenged, and investigations shifted to the artisans and the sans culottes. 
Much of this class analysis retains a strong Marxian flavour, especially with 
those who deny any Marxist connections. In one view, the 'bagarre des profs' 
over the French Revolution 'has become the Divine Comedy of the modern 
secular world.'- 

As always in a crisis, psychological factors were paramount. The King and 


his ministers did not have to be told that disaster loomed; but, unlike historians, 
they did not have 200 years in which to study it. Indeed, with no popular 
representation in place they had no reliable means of gauging public attitudes. 
Similarly, in the depths of a serf-run countryside, or of proletarian Paris, there 
was no means of regulating the waves of poverty-led fear and of blind anger. 
The combination of indecision at the centre and of panic amidst large sections of 
the populace was a sure recipe for catastrophe. Above all, violence bred 
violence. Trom the very beginning ... violence was the motor of revolution.'- 

There is much to be said for exploring the Revolution's international 
dimensions from the very earliest point.- When one considers the mechanisms 
which transformed generalized ferment into explosive revolution, political and 
military logistics have to be taken into the equation. There were several casks in 
the European cellar which were ready to blow their corks, and which actually did 
so. But in the case of the lesser casks, the corks could be swiftly replaced. It was 
only when one of the bigger barrels threatened to explode that the cellar as a 
whole was in danger. It is for this reason that historians have paid almost 
exclusive attention to events in Paris. Yet in terms of chronology and 
precedence, several other centres of ferment have to be brought into the 
reckoning. Extremely important, though not always mentioned, were 
developments in the Netherlands, first in the United Provinces and later in the 
Austrian Netherlands. Important, too, was the advanced disaffection of several 
French provinces, notably in the Dauphine. Crucial for the whole of Eastern 
Europe was the meeting of the Great Sejm of Poland-Lithuania, bent on reform 
at all costs. Each of these stress-points acted to some degree on the others. 
Together, they showed that the revolutionary ferment had assumed 
transcontinental proportions before the explosion occurred. 

In the United Provinces, the ancient conflict between the Stadholder and his 
opponents reached a new boiling-point in October 1787, when the Prussian army 
was invited in to maintain the status quo. The Dutch had suffered acutely from 
their adherence to armed neutrality during the American War of Independence, 
and from the resultant naval war with Great Britain. By the late 1780s old- 
established commercial and republican interests were in revolt against the 
Stadholder, Willem V (r. 1766-94), and his British and Prussian allies. They 
began to call themselves 'patriots' in the American style, and claimed to be the 
champions of the people against the princes. They caused an international outcry 
when in the course of their campaign against the government they kidnapped the 


Stadholder's consort, Wilhelmina. It was Wilhelmina's misfortune which spurred 
the Prussians into action and provided the pretext for the pacifications which 
followed in Amsterdam and elsewhere. But the appeal to force was not lost on 
those who were watching on the sidelines. It undoubtedly strengthened the 
resolve of the 'patriots' in the Austrian Netherlands, who were engaged in a trial 
of strength of their own; and it caught the attention of the French at the very time 
when relations between the monarch and his subjects were coming under intense 
scrutiny. French dissidents had looked to Holland as a haven of liberty ever since 
the days of Descartes. From 1787 the Dutch dissidents were looking again to 
France as the only realistic source of a rescue. 

The Estates of Dauphine met in the Salle du Jeu de Paume in the Chateau de 
Vizille, near Grenoble, on 21 July 1788. The meeting, which was illegal, had 
been conceived by local prominents as a means of defending the provincial 
parlement against the royal decrees which it had recently been ordered to 
register. It was the first assembly of its kind since 1628, when Richelieu had 
suspended many provincial institutions; and it was prompted by a riotous 
demonstration in support of the parlement which had taken place in Grenoble on 
7 June. It started a process of escalating demands which anticipated many of the 
events in Paris a year later. The Parlement of Dauphine had been defying royal 
authority for more than twenty years. Its refusal to legalize many of the King's 
demands for increased taxation had given it great local popularity. The decrees 
of May 1788, which aimed to break all such recalcitrant parlements and which 
provided for the banishment of offending magistrates, threatened to overthrow 
the comfortable stand-off of a whole generation. 

A second meeting of the Dauphine Estates at Romans in September 1788 
was technically legal, since it coincided with authorized preparations for the 
Estates-General. But it saw the passage of a veritable provincial constitution. 
Apart from the election of deputies to the Estates-General, among them Lefranc 
de Pompignan, Archbishop of Vienne, it heard impassioned speeches on civic 
rights from its chairman, Judge J.-J. Mounier (1758-1806), the future Chairman 
of the Constituent Assembly, and from Antoine Barnave (1761-93), soon to be 
the author of the Jacobin Manifesto. It arranged for the doubling of the 
representation of its Tiers Etat, for joint debate of the three orders, and for 
individual voting. Each of these measures, when repeated in the Estates-General, 
was to turn a subservient body convened by the King into an independent 
assembly bent on implementing its own agenda. As the local guidebook proudly 
proclaims, '1788 est l'annee de la Revolution dauphinoise.'- 


The mini-revolution in Dauphine caused ructions at the royal court. It 
provoked the resignation of the King's chief minister, Archbishop Lomenie de 
Brienne, who had set in motion the convocation of the Estates-General but who 
was now refused permission to crush the rebel province by force. The way was 
thus opened for the return of Jacques Necker, the Swiss banker, who was 
recalled to rescue the King's finances. The events in Dauphine dominated the 
deliberations of the (second) assembly of notables which was summoned to 
Versailles in November 1788 to advise on preparations for the Estates-General. 
The proposals of the dauphinois regarding the role of the Third Estate 
undoubtedly influenced the most radical pamphlet of the day. 'What is the Third 
Estate?' asked the pamphlet's author, the Abbe Sieves. 'Everything. And what 
has it been until the present time? Nothing. And what does it demand? To 
become something. '- 

In Warsaw, the assembly of the Wielki Sejm or 'Four Years' Diet' in October 
1788 was conceived as part of a royal scheme to gain Russian approval for 
restoring the Republic's independence. It started a process of reform in Poland- 
Lithuania which ran parallel to developments in France until both were 
overtaken by coercion. Much had changed in recent years. Frederick the Great 
was dead, and the new King of Prussia was well disposed to his Polish 
neighbours. Russia was heavily engaged in campaigns against both Swedes and 
Turks. Austria under Joseph II was preoccupied with the Netherlands. In 1787 
Stanislaw-August judged the moment ripe for an overture to the Empress 
Catherine. If the Empress would permit the Republic to raise a modern army, and 
the financial and administrative structures to support it, the King would 
immediately sign a treaty of alliance with Russia for common operations against 
the Turks. Russia and the Republic could then pursue their objectives in 
harmony. In May the King received the Russian Empress on the Dnieper near the 
royal castle of Kaniow. In this, the last meeting with his former lover, he learned 
little from Catherine. But it gradually emerged that the Empress, who also 
conferred with Joseph II, was not well disposed. In fact, she was determined to 
maintain the status quo at all costs. Polish aspirations were not to be 
accommodated. 

Poland's Diet pressed on regardless with the internal aspects of the King's 
scheme. In October 1788 it began by declaring itself a confederation and subject 
to majority voting, thereby bypassing the liberum veto of its russophile 
members. It then proceeded to vote for the creation of a national army of 
100,000 men, a step which had been blocked ever since the Russian-guaranteed 


constitution of 1717. It also backed a rapprochement with Frederick-William II 
of Prussia. Its activists were grouped round the anglophile King, who dreamt of 
a British-style monarchy, and a group of intellectuals-the Revd Hugo Kollataj 
(1750-1812), Rector of the reformed Jagiellonian University, the Revd Stanislaw 
Staszic (1755-1826), and Stanislaw Malachowski (1736-1809), Speaker of the 
Sejm, who were all strong admirers of the American example. After three years 
of frenzied legislation, their brief moment of glory was to come in May 1791, 
when they pushed through their Constitution of Third May (see below). 

In November 1788 the Estates of Brabant and Hainault took an equally 
momentous step. Infuriated by the torrent of reforms imposed by their overlord, 
the Emperor Joseph II, they voted to withhold the provinces' taxes. They had 
long felt aggrieved both on religious and on political grounds. As Catholics of 
the Spanish school, they could not easily accept the imperial decrees which had 
suppressed seminaries, pilgrimages, and contemplative orders; which had 
replaced episcopal by state censorship; and which had subjected the Church to 
direct taxation. Equally, as beneficiaries of privileges which had functioned since 
1354, they could not bear the Emperor's lack of consultation. The cities of 
Brussels, Antwerp, and Louvain were jealously attached to their traditional right 
of veto over the deliberations of the Estates. Yet by making their stand at the 
time they did, they precipitated a constitutional crisis which would play itself out 
in the Austrian Netherlands one step ahead of the parallel crisis that was brewing 
in France. The Belgian 'patriots' hit the headlines in Paris in the same week that 
France's notables were heading for Versailles to advise on the agenda of the 
Estates-General. The Emperor tried to impose a new constitution on the Belgian 
Estates on 29 April 1789, exactly six days before France's Estates-General 
convened. When the Emperor's impositions were rejected by the State Council 
of the Austrian Netherlands, he determined to use force. The Austrian army 
invaded Brussels, dissolved the State Council, and abolished the Joyeuse Entree 
on 20 June 1789. This was the self-same day when a defiant Estates-General, by 
taking the 'Tennis Court Oath', was setting the revolutionary process in motion 
in France (see below). 

Brussels and Paris shared the same language. News travelled fast between 
them. The 'Belgian Revolt', which continued to run long after the Emperor's 
coup, was an essential component of the 'French Revolution'. Paris did not lead 
Brussels; Brussels led Paris. 


The last week of April 1789 brought death to the streets of Paris. An 



exceptionally cold winter had added to the hardships inflicted by a bankrupt 
government, rising prices, and lack of work. Hunger stalked the poorer districts, 
and raids on bakeries were frequent. When a rich manufacturer called Reveillon 
dared to say in public that his workmen could live well off half the 30 sous per 
day which he paid them, his house in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine was 
surrounded. On the first day, the angry crowd demolished several buildings 
amidst cries of 'Vive le tiers!' and 'Vive Necker!'. On the second day, when 
soldiers of the Regiment du Royal-Cravatte were brought in, they were pelted 
with missiles; and someone fired a shot. The soldiers responded with volleys of 
musket-fire that left at least 300 dead. This was the news which awaited the 
members of the Estates-General when they converged on the capital at the 
weekend from all ends of France. 

Revolution 

In France, as in England 149 years before, the general crisis came to a head 
when a bankrupt King summoned a long-neglected Parliament to his aid. The 
expectation on all sides was that financial relief for the royal government would 
be granted in return for the redress of grievances. By prior arrangement, 
therefore, all the delegations elected by the provinces and cities came to the 
Estates-General armed with cahiers de doleances or 'catalogues of complaint'. 
These cahiers were intended by the King's ministers, and are widely used by 
historians, as a prime instrument for assessing the nature and proportions of 
popular discontent. Some of the complaints were less than revolutionary: 'that 
the master wig-maker of Nantes be not troubled with new guild-brethren, the 
actual number of ninety-two being more than sufficient.'- 

The opening scene in Paris, on Sunday 4 May 1789, was painted in one of 
Carlyle's memorable word-pictures: 

Behold ... the doors of St. Louis Church flung wide: and the Procession of Processions advancing to Notre- 
Dame! ... The Elected of France, and then the Court of France, are marshalled ... all in prescribed place 
and costume. Our Commons 'in plain black mantle and white cravate'; Nobles in gold-worked, bright-dyed 
cloaks of velvet, resplendent, mstling with laces, waving with plumes; the Clergy in rochet, alb, or other 
best pontificalibus. Lastly comes the King himself, and the King's Household, also in the brightest blaze of 
pomp ... Some fourteen hundred men blown together from all winds, on the deepest errand. 

Yes, in that silent marching mass there is futurity enough. No symbolic Arc, like the old Hebrews, do 
those men bear; yet with them, too, is a Covenant They, too, preside at a new era in the history of men. The 
whole future is there, and Destiny dim-brooding over it, in (their) hearts and unshaped thoughts .. .- 


Once summoned, however, the Estates-General proved impossible to control. 
The three orders of clergy, nobility, and Third Estate were supposed to meet 
separately, and to follow an agenda laid down by the royal managers. But the 
Third Estate, which had been granted double representation as in Dauphine, soon 
realized that it could bend the proceedings to its own desires, if the three 
chambers were permitted to vote as one. The clergy and nobility, who included 
many sympathizers, offered no concerted opposition. So on 17 June, having 
invited the two other Estates to join them, the Third Estate broke the existing 
rules and declared itself to be the sole National Assembly. This was the decisive 
break. Three days later, locked out of their usual hall, the deputies met on the 
adjacent tennis court, le jeu de paume, and swore an oath never to disband until 
France was given a Constitution. Tell your master', thundered Count Mirabeau, 
to troops sent to disperse them, That we are here by the will of the people, and 
will not disperse before the threat of bayonets.' [gauche] 

Pandemonium ensued. At court, the King's conciliatory ministers fell out 
with their more aggressive colleagues. On 11 July Jacques Necker, who had 
received a rousing welcome at the opening of the Estates-General, was 
dismissed. Paris exploded. A revolutionary headquarters coalesced round the 
Due d'Orleans at the Palais Royal. The gardens of the Palais Royal became a 
notorious playground of free speech and free love. Sex shows sprang up 
alongside every sort of political harangue. The exile of Necker', screamed the 
fiery orator Camille Desmoulins, fearing reprisals, 'is the signal for another St 
Bartholomew of patriots.' The royal garrison was won over. On the 13th a 
Committee of Public Safety was created, and 48,000 men were enrolled in a 
National Guard under General Lafayette. Bands of insurgents tore down the 
hated barrieres or internal customs posts in the city, and ransacked the 
monastery of Saint-Lazare in the search for arms. On the 14th, after 30,000 
muskets were removed from the Hotel des Invalides, the royal fortress of the 
Bastille was besieged. There was a brief exchange of gunfire, after which the 
governor capitulated. The King had lost his capital. 

At that point, at the centre of affairs, there was still hope of an orderly 
settlement. On the 17th, to much surprise, Louis XVI drove from Versailles to 
Paris and donned the tricolour cockade in public. In the provinces, in contrast, 
news of the fall of the Bastille triggered an orgy of attacks on 'forty thousand 
other bastilles'. Castles and abbeys were burned; noble families, indiscriminately 
attacked by hungry peasants, began to emigrate; cities declared for self-rule; 
brigandage proliferated. France was dividing into armed camps. It was the 



season of la Grande Peur, the Great Fear-a summer of unprecedented social 
hysteria fired by rumours of aristocratic plots and peasant atrocities across the 
country.- 

From then on, the Revolution acquired its own momentum, its rhythms 
dictated by tides of uncontrolled events. It passed through three main phases. 

In the first, five-year phase, 1789-94, the French Revolution accelerated through 
ever-increasing degrees of radicalism until all the institutions of the previous 
social and political order had been swept away. For more than two years the 
National Assembly, the Constituante, laboured over the design of a 
constitutional monarchy. In one full night, 4-5 August 1789, thirty separate 
decrees abolished all the apparatus of serfdom and noble privilege. The 
Declaration of the Rights of Man (26 August 1789) was followed by the 
abolition of the provinces (December 1789) and the civil establishment of the 
clergy (June 1790). It appeared that stability and consensus might have been 
achieved when, on the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille, on 14 July 1790, the 
whole of France joined in a Grand Festival of Federation. In Paris, the King 
attended mass in the presence of the leaders of the assembly, and the commander 
of the National Guard, General Lafayette, swore a solemn oath of allegiance 
proffered by the Bishop of Autun, Talleyrand. 

In the Austrian Netherlands, the revolution was moving still faster. In August 
1789 the powerful Archbishopric of Liege was seized by 'patriots' in a bloodless 
coup. In August a patriotic army was raised by General de Mersch to confront 
the Austrians. In November demonstrations in Ghent ended in bloody massacres; 
and finally, in December, Brussels expelled its Austrian garrison. By the end of 
the year an independent Union of Belgian States had been declared. It lasted for 
thirteen months, before the re-entry of the Austrians in force in February 1791. 

In France, the introduction of a consolidated Constitution (September 1791) 
called for elections which swept the original, moderate leaders aside. The new 
Legislative Assembly was much less sympathetic to the monarchy. It struggled 
to get a grip for twelve months until it, too, was overtaken by the declaration of a 
Republic and the opening of the Republic's National Convention. Then, in the 
summer of 1792, with France at war, the mainstream revolutionary movement 
was hijacked by root-and-branch radicals, who had earlier seized control of the 
municipal Commune of Paris. Hence, if the Estates-General and the National 
Assembly (1789-91) were dominated by Mirabeau's constitutionalists, and the 


Legislative Assembly (1791-2) by republican Girondins, the National 
Convention (1792-5) took its orders from Robespierre's extremist Jacobins. 

The two dread years of Jacobin supremacy began during the invasion scare 
of 1792, when the Prussian army was thought to be in striking distance of Paris 
(see below). When the King dismissed his Girondin ministers in expectation of 
foreign rescue, popular resentments began to rise. In July, when the manifesto of 
the Duke of Brunswick announced his intention to liberate the King and to 
execute the whole population of Paris if the Royal Palace was touched, they 
boiled over. It was exactly the pretext which the Jacobins needed to declare 'the 
fatherland in danger', and to call for the abolition of the monarchy. Five hundred 
ardent Massilians marched to the support of Paris. On 10 August, with the 
Massilians in the van, the Tuileries was duly stormed and the King's Swiss 
Guard massacred. In September, with the Commune controlling the capital, 
thousands in the Paris prisons were butchered in cold blood; the King was 
deposed; and the Republic declared. 


GAUCHE 

From the earliest days of France's Estates-General, the nobles of the Court 
Party instinctively positioned themselves to the right of the King, whilst the 
Third Estate sat on the left. To sit on the right-hand of authority, as on 'the 
right-hand of God', was an established mark of privilege. As a result, 'the 
Right' became a natural synonym for the political Establishment, whilst 'the 
Left' was applied to its opponents. These divisions grew more marked after 
1793 in the National Convention, where the Jacobins and their associates 
occupied benches in the left and upper sections of the chamber. They formed 
the revolutionary block of deputies on the 'Montague ', which physically 
towered over the moderates of the 'Plaine' below. The opposition of 'Left' 
and 'Right' has provided a basic metaphor for the political spectrum ever 
since. 1 

Yet the metaphor has its problems. It only works if the political spectrum 
is seen to be ranged along a straight line, with 'Left' and 'Right' separated by 
the conciliatory 'Centre' between them: 




Reform-Status quo-Reaction 

Extreme-Left-Centre-Left-CENTRE-Centre-Right-Right-Extreme 

Left Right 

In this scheme, the most successful politicians are likely to be those who 
command the consensus of 'the centre ground' with the help of either the 
moderate Left or the moderate Right. 

Marxists, and other dialecticians, however, see the political spectrum not 
as unilinear, but as bi-polar. In their scheme, politics consists of a struggle 
where two opposite forces are fated to contend, and where one or the other 
will necessarily establish supremacy. In the long run, as in a tug-of-war, or 
with a pair of scales, the Centre cannot hold the balance indefinitely, and 
must always give way to 'Left' or 'Right'. The notion of a political order 
based on consensus, tolerance, compromise, restraint, or mutual respect for 
the law is a 'bourgeois illusion'. 

LEFT-r-RIGHT 

A 

Progress Regress 


What the unilinear and the bi-polar schemes share is the dubious assumption 
that 'Left' and 'Right' are simple opposites. 

The spatial arrangement of political assemblies, therefore, involves 
important considerations. The British House of Commons, for example, 
places the Government benches on the Speaker's Right in direct 
confrontation with the Opposition benches on the Speaker's Left. It 
accurately reflects the adversarial politics of the two-party system, putting 
ministers and shadow ministers face to face in their exchanges across the 
despatch box. This, too, is a dialectical concept, actively discouraging the 
activities of a third party and the spirit of coalition on which most 
Continental assemblies depend. It could not be adapted to the purposes of an 
assembly elected by proportional representation. The House of Lords, in 
contrast, which has to make provision for a substantial body of independent 
members on the 'cross benches', is arranged round three sides of an open 
rectangle. In the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the massed rows of an 
undivided hall indicated the compulsory unanimity of all present (see 



Appendix III, p. 1334). 

None the less, twentieth century experience has shown that the political 
Right could be every bit as radical as the political Left. In addition to 
opposing each other, the radical elements of Left and Right shared the 
ambition for overthrowing the democratic consensus. In this light, the 
realization dawned that political forces may best be aligned round a circular 
track. In this scheme, not only does Left oppose Right, but Totalitarianism 
opposes Democracy: 

DEMOCRACY 
CENTRE 


LEFT RIGHT 

\ / 

TOTALITARIANISM 


Given these considerations, it emerges that a horse-shoe or a semicircle 
provides the most appropriate spatial arrangement for the multiple but 
competing interests within a democratic assembly. Such is the layout, not 
only for many national assemblies in Europe, from Warsaw to Paris, but also 
for the 'hemicercle' of the European Parliament at Strasbourg. 2 


On 20 September, the opening of the National Convention coincided exactly 
with the cannonade at Valmy which saved the Revolution from suppression from 
abroad. 22 September, the day when the Republic was proclaimed, was later 
judged to be the starting-point of the Revolutionary Calendar, [vendemiaire]. 

In due course executive power was concentrated in two successive 
Committees of Public Safety-the first (April-July 1793), dominated by Danton, 
the second (July 1793-July 1794) by Robespierre. The Convention's 
independent initiatives were ended. The foreign war was prosecuted with vigour. 
The 'Counter-Revolution', in the Vendee and elsewhere, was mercilessly 






assaulted. A new super-democratic Constitution providing for universal suffrage, 
for referenda, and for an elected government was passed, but remained a dead 
letter. The Committees of Public Safety in Paris maintained their grip on the 
whole country through a network of subsidiary committees in every commune 
and department in France. These committees, formed by the law of 21 March 
1793 for regulating foreigners, became instruments of unlimited dictatorial 
control. 


VENDEMIAIRE 

In October and November 1793, France's National Convention voted to 
introduce a Republican Calendar based on revolutionary principles. In a 
series of decrees it was decided that the year should begin at midnight on the 
autumnal equinox of 22 September, and that Year I of the Republican era 
should be judged to have begun on the day of the Proclamation of the 
Republic, 22 September 1792. The year was to be divided into twelve equal 
months of thirty days, and each month into three ten-day 'decades' (There 
were to be no more weeks, or Sundays.) 

months: Vendemiaire (Month of Harvest); Brumaire (Month of Mist); 
Frimaire (Month of Frost); Nivose (Month of Snow); Pluviose (Month of 
Rain); Ventose (Month of Wind); Germinal (Month of Seeds); Floreal 
(Month of Flowers); Prairial (Haymaking Month); Messidor (Month of 
Reaping); Thermidor (Month of Heat); Fructidor (Month of Fruits). 

days: 1,11,21, primidi; 2,12,22, duodi; 3,13,23, tridi; 4,14,24, quartidi; 
5, 15, 25, quintidi; 6,16, 26, sextidi; 7,17, 27, septidi; 8, 18, 28, octidi; 9, 19, 
29, nonidi; 10, 20, 30, decadi. (See Appendix III, pp. 1288-9.) 

When the system was put into operation, 1 January 1794 was officially 
transformed into Duodi of the 2nd Decade, 12 Nivose, Year II. 

To keep in line with the natural year of 36514 days, the calendar years 
were organized into four-year groups called franciades; and each year was 
allocated five complementary days, the sans-culottides. The fourth year of 
each franciade received an extra 'leap day', the Jour de la Revolution. 




The Republican Calendar was officially maintained for fourteen years; 
but it was virtually abandoned after six. The Gregorian Calendar was in 
widespread use again under the Consulate, long before it was formally 
restored on 1 January 1806/11 Nivose XIV. 

Nothing was better calculated to disrupt the nation's sense of orientation 
than the change of calendar. Counter-revolutionaries tried to keep up the old 
time. Revolutionaries tried to insist on the new. Historians have to cope with 
both. 


The Revolution started to devour its own children. The Terror raged, 
consuming an ever-mounting tally of victims. Danton and his associates were 
denounced and executed in April 1794, for questioning the purposes of the 
Terror. Robespierre, the chief terrorist, met denunciation and death on 28 July 
1794,10 Thermidor II. [guillotin] 

The fate of the monarchy mirrored these developments. In October 1789, 
after a Women's March of protest to Versailles, Louis XVI had been brought 
with his family to their palace of the Tuileries in Paris. He was already the butt 
of indecent humour: 


Louis si tu veux voir 
Batard, cocu, putain, 

Re garde ton miroir 
La Reine et le Dauphin. 

(Louis if you wish to see I Bastard, cuckold, and whore, I Look at your mirror I 
Your queen and your son.)- 

In June 1791, after repudiating all concessions made since the days of the Tennis 
Court Oath, he had fled in disguise to the eastern frontier, only to be caught at 
Varennes in Champagne. Returned to Paris in disgrace, he then signed the first 
Constitution as prepared by the National Assembly, becoming the 'hereditary 
agent' of the people. In August 1792, when the Tuileries was stormed, he was 
arrested and 'suspended'. In September, he was deposed. On 21 January 1793 he 
was tried and executed as a traitor. On 16 October Marie-Antoinette suffered the 
same fate. The ten-year-old Dauphin, Louis XVII, was handed to plebeian foster- 





parents, and subsequently died from neglect and tuberculosis. 

In Poland-Lithuania, events followed the same progression from constitutional 
reform to revolutionary terrorism. In the Constitution of 3 May 1791, in one 
short document of eleven clauses, all the obvious abuses of the old system, 
including the liberum veto, were abolished. The Rzeczpospolita oboyga 
narodow, the 'commonwealth of two nations' was established as a modern 
constitutional state. The monarchy was declared hereditary (though the King was 
an ageing bachelor). The bourgeoisie was admitted to the franchise previously 
limited to the nobility. The peasants were brought within the realm of public law, 
from which they had been excluded. Here was the first concrete success of 
peaceful reform, the first constitution of its type in Europe, formulated, passed, 
and published four months before its counterpart in France. It was the sort of 
advance which liberal reformers had been hoping for far and wide. In London, 
the enthusiasm of Edmund Burke knew no bounds. The Polish Constitution of 
Third May, Burke wrote 'is probably the most pure ... public good which has 
ever been conferred on mankind': 

The means were as striking to the imagination as satisfactory to the reason, and as soothing to the moral 
sentiments ... Everything was kept in its place and order, but... everything was bettered. To add to this 
unheard-of conjunction of wisdom and fortune, this happy wonder, not one drop of blood was spilled, no 
treachery, no outrage ... Happy people if they know how to proceed as they have begun.- 


GUILLOTIN 

Dr josephe-ignace guillotin (1738-1814) did not invent the guillotine. 
What he did was to urge France's National Assembly to adopt the 
humanitarian execution machine invented by his colleague Antoine Louis. 
The proposal was adopted in April 1792, in good time for the Jacobin Terror, 
thereby raising Guillotin to the status of an eponym -'a person after which 
something is (believed to be) named'. 1 The revolutionary years produced 
many such eponyms. Among them was Jean bigot, Napoleon's Minister for 
Religious Affairs, and the ultra-patriotic soldier Nicolas chauvin, who sang 
'Je suis fran^ais, je suis Chauvin'. 

Many eponymous words have passed into the international vocabulary. 





Botany has been a fertile source, since scores of exotic plants were named 
after their discoverers, begonia, which took its name from the botanist 
Michel Begon (d. 1710), was an early example, as were camellia, dahlia, 
fuchsia, and magnolia. The purple rock-plant aubrietia was named after 
the French painter Claude Aubriet (1665-1742). 

Physics has perpetuated the memory of its pioneers by allocating their 
names to universal units of measurement. The ampere, the metric unit of 
electric current, recalls Andre Ampere (1775-1836). Many others, from 
angstrom to ohm, volt, and watt fall within the same category. 

Garments are a common source of eponyms. cardigan and raglan were 
both derived from British generals in Crimea. The fashionable leotard 
derives from the acrobat Jules Leotard (1842-70). All wearers of 
pantaloons, pants, and panties should remember the father of trouserdom, 
Pantaleone de' Bisognosi, who figured in the Commedia dell'Arte. 

Food produced many examples, bechamel sauce derives from a steward 
to Louis XIV. The sandwich, after John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich 
(1718-92), was an eighteenth-century concoction. The nineteenth century 
gave rise to Chateaubriand steak, Madeleine cake, and pavlova, recalling 
respectively a marquis, a pastry-cook, and a prima ballerina. Smoking after 
dinner offers a reminder of the sometime French ambassador to Portugal, 
Jean Nicot (1530-1600). 

Technical inventions often attracted the name of their inventors: hence 
SPINET and MANSARD, DIESEL, SHRAPNEL, and BIRO. 

Many eponyms, however, are contested. Not all scholars accept that the 
painter Federigo Barocci (d. 1612) was the originator of the baroque, nor 
that an Irish tearaway of Victorian London, Patrick Houlihan, was the 
original hooligan. But one thing cannot be contested: Europe's present is 
filled with the verbal shades of Europe's past. 


Burke's welcome for the 'Polish Revolution' ought to be as well known as his 
denunciation of events in France. In Holland, the Leyden Gazette wrote: 'If there 
are miracles in this century, one has happened in Poland.' 

The 'happy wonder' lasted for little more than a year. Russia was not 
prepared to tolerate a constitutional, let alone an independent, Poland on its 




doorstep. Just as Poland-Lithuania experienced the first round of revolutionary 
reform, it was also due to experience the first round of revolutionary war. As in 
France, the Polish reformers were driven from moderation to desperation. After 
the Constitution of 1791 was suppressed by Russian intervention and the Second 
Partition (see below), the national rising of 1794 took the field with still more 
radical proposals, only to see itself disintegrate amidst violence and terror. In 
France the revolutionary process was contained by its own internal reactions; in 
Poland it was destroyed by foreign force. 

In the second phase, 1794-1804, which begins with Thermidor II, the French 
Revolution visibly halted in its tracks-to take breath and to take stock. 
Although executive instability continued, the blood-lust stopped. So, too, did the 
mania for legislation. (The National Convention passed 11,250 decrees in just 
over three years.) The revolutionaries had found a talent for war, and were 
absorbed in fighting their enemies. A series of political expedients were tried by 
politicians united only by the need to maintain order and to stem excess. After 
Robespierre's fall the Thermidorians ruled for 16 months. In November 1795, 
thanks to yet another constitution and yet another, two-tier, assembly, a five-man 
executive 'Directory' came into being. In September 1797 (18 Fructidor V), the 
Directors muzzled the assembly. In November 1799, thanks to the coup d'etat of 
18 Brumaire VIII by the Directory's most successful general, a three-man 
'Consulate' was instituted, and confirmed by nation-wide plebiscite. In May 
1802 the most successful general raised himself to the status of first Consul for 
life; in May 1804, to that of Emperor. 

In the third, imperial phase, 1804-15, the Revolution found stability by locking 
itself to the cult of that general, the Empire's creator, Napoleon Bonaparte. The 
doubts and divisions which still remained in France were submerged under the 
titanic operations of his mission to conquer the world. Bonapartism turned 
revolutionary war and conquest into ends in themselves, and military 
requirements into an absolute priority. A pseudo-monarchy headed pseudo- 
democratic institutions; and an efficient centralized administration ran on a 
strange cocktail of legislative leftovers and bold innovation. Success or failure 
was handed to the gods of the battlefield. 'Success', said Napoleon, 'is the 
greatest orator in the world.' 

Periodization arranged according to executive authority gives a slightly 
different result. In that case the phase of constitutional monarchy lasts from June 



1789 to September 1792; the 'first Republic' from 1792 to November 1799; the 
dictatorship of Napoleon from '18 Brumaire' to 1815 (see Appendix III, pp. 
1286-7). The full range of revolutionary opinion became apparent in the early 
1790s through the debates of the National Assembly and through the formation 
of political clubs. 

The original constitutionalists, led by Count Honore de Mirabeau (1749-91) 
and other liberal nobles such as General Lafayette, were responsible for the 
abolition of the absolute monarchy and of noble and clerical privilege. By the 
time of Mirabeau's (natural) death in April 1791, they were becoming a hard- 
pressed minority. They met in the club of the Feuillants, and after the King's 
flight to Varennes were left with the impossible task of delaying the demise of an 
unpopular monarchy. At one point Mirabeau had the idea of dedicating a 
monument to Louis XVI, the 'founder of French liberty'. 

The Girondins took their name from a group of deputies from Bordeaux, 
capital of the Gironde, headed by the eloquent lawyer Pierre Vergniaud (1753- 
93), who came together in the Legislative Assembly. They were the centrists of 
the early years, willing to co-operate with the King's government but 
increasingly giving vent to democratic and republican sentiments. Their 
activities revolved round the salon of Mme Roland, and their influence reached 
its height in 1792, when they ran the King's last government and pioneered the 
transition to the Republic. 

The Jacobins, in contrast, la Societe des Amis de la Liberte et VEgalite, were 
advocates of unlimited democracy, of revolutionary dictatorship and violence. 
They took their name from the site of their Club in a former Dominican convent 
on the Rue Saint-Honore. (The Dominicans of Paris were known as 'Jacobins' 
because of their earlier residence on the Rue Saint-Jacques.) They formed a tiny, 
iron-hard clique-perhaps 3,000 persons who perfected the art of gripping the 
throats of 20 million. Their members ranged from the Prince de Broglie and a 
couple of dukes-the Duke d'Aiguillon and the young Due de Chartres (the 
future King, Louis-Philippe)-to the rough-hewn Breton peasant, 'Pere' Gerard. 
Gerard once told them, 'I had thought myself in Heaven among you, if there 
were not so many lawyers.' Their leaders included Georges Danton (1759-94), 
whom Carlyle called 'a Man from the great fire-bosom of Nature herself', 
Camille Desmoulins (1760-94), a firebrand journalist, who died beside him, 
Jean Marat (1743-93), the 'sick physician', editor of L'Ami du Peuple, Jerome 
Petion de Villeneuve (1756-94), sometime Mayor of Paris, Antoine Saint-Just 



(1767-94), known as 'the Archangel of the Terror' and as 'St John' for his 
servility towards Robespierre, and Robespierre himself. 

Maximilien Robespierre (1758-94), the severe, the puritanical, the 
'incorruptible advocate of Arras', was said to have refused a career as a judge 
before the Revolution rather than condemn a man to death. His power and 
influence assumed legendary proportions during the second Committee of Public 
Safety. He was the hero of the Paris mob, the devil incarnate to his opponents. 

The Jacobins first surfaced in 1791, through the King's risky politique du 
pire, based on the idea of promoting his wildest opponents in the hope of taming 
the rest. After Petion was appointed Mayor of Paris with the King's approval, 
they took an unshakeable hold on the capital's municipal government, the 
Commune. Thereafter, having systematically eliminated their rivals and tamed 
the Convention, they decimated their own ranks until Robespierre alone 
remained alive. Danton's watchword was 'De l'audace, encore de Paudace, 
toujours de l'au-dace' Saint-Just, attacking the monarchy, declared, 'One cannot 
reign innocently.' In proposing the redistribution of his enemies' wealth, he said: 
'Happiness is a new idea in Europe.' Robespierre once asked the Convention, 
'Citoyens, voulez-vous une Revolution sans revolution?' (Citizens, do you want 
a Revolution without revolution?) The associated Club of the Cordeliers, la 
Societe des Droits de 1'Homme et du Citoyen, whose membership overlapped 
with the Jacobins, met in a former Franciscan monastery in the Cordelier district 
of Paris. Their later leaders, the true enrages like J. R. Hebert (1757-94), were 
marked out for their militant atheism and the cult of reason. Hebert was executed 
on Robespierre's orders for 'extremism', [gauche] 

If most of the Jacobins were professional lawyers and journalists, the 
majority of their active supporters were drawn from the anonymous proletarians 
of the Paris suburbs. These sansculottes contained elements that were still more 
radical than any of the groups and individuals that actually exercised power. 
They numbered among them Europe's very first communists, socialists, 
feminists. Organized in meeting-houses in each of the Paris 'sections', obscure 
formations such as the Societe Patriotique de la Section du Luxembourg or the 
Societe Fraternelle des Deux Sexes du Pantheon-Frangais exercised an 
influence that has not always been properly assessed. Indeed, in terms of 
revolutionary motive power they may well have been more effective than the 
bourgeois who are usually given the credit. They supplied many of the 
revolutionary commissars of the Jacobin period. They forged a lasting tradition 



which contested established authority in each of the 'revolutions' of the 
nineteenth century.- 

Opposition to the Revolution came in many forms and from all quarters. It can 
be classified as political, social, ideological, and regional. Initially it focused on 
the royal court, where the 'ultras' led by the Count of Provence (later Louis 
XVIII) aimed to restore the status quo ante. They were joined by the majority of 
dispossessed nobles, and by the formidable array of emigres, high and low. They 
opposed not only the republicans and Jacobins but also the constitutionalists: the 
court's contempt for General Lafayette, for example, knew no bounds. After 
1790, when forbidden by the Pope to swear the oath of loyalty to the civil 
establishment, the clergy were forced either to submit or to defy. After 1792, 
when the Revolution took an atheistic and not merely an anticlerical turn, all 
Roman Catholics, and hence the great majority of the population, stood to be 
offended. This major source of counter-revolutionary feelings remained active 
until Bonaparte's Concordat with the Papacy in 1801. The peasant masses, who 
were given their freedom in 1789, were long thought to be among the main 
beneficiaries of revolution. It is now generally recognized, however, that a gulf 
of non-comprehension separated the peasant ethos from that of the revolutionary 
leaders in Paris. The peasantry soon turned against the oppressions of a 
republican regime which many thought worse than its predecessors. 

Intellectual opposition to revolutionary ideas was not fully formulated until 
after the Restoration. But nothing could be more hostile than the Considerations 
sur la France (1796) of the Savoyard magistrate Josephe de Maistre (1753- 
1821), who took revolutionaries to be servants of Satan. He also opposed the 
strand of enlightened universalism which had found its way into revolutionary 
thought. He wrote that he had often met Frenchmen, Italians, Germans, and 
Russians-'But as for Man, I've never met one in my life.' His contemporary, 
Antoine Rivarol (1753-1801), known as 'le Comte de Rivarol', who had written 
a famous discourse in praise of the French language, was forced to flee when he 
turned to counterrevolutionary pamphleteering. 'One does not fire guns against 
ideas,' he wrote. 

Several French provinces remained staunchly royalist at heart, and 
repeatedly broke into open revolt. Royalist risings had to be suppressed even in 
Paris, notably on 13 Vendemiaire IV (1795). In some of the remoter departments, 
such as Le Gard, resistance continued right through to 1815.- The most 


determined resistance, however, was undoubtedly concentrated in the west. 
Popular fury had been rising there for several years, after an initially favourable 
reaction to the fall of the Ancien Regime. In 1792 many parishes supported the 
priests who refused to swear allegiance to the civil establishment. They were 
often rewarded by gangs of urban republicans who toured the countryside, 
smashing churches and assaulting the 'refractories'. In 1793 the same villages 
were hardest hit by the introduction of universal male conscription. They were 
specially offended by the exemptions that were frequently granted to the sons of 
republican administrators and professionals: it seemed that Catholic peasants 
were being ordered to die for an atheist Republic which they had never wanted 
in the first place. In May 1792 Danton was informed of a plot supposedly being 
hatched by the Marquis de la Rouairie in Brittany. The plot was nipped in the 
bud; but it was the precursor of two interrelated instances of mass rebellion, the 
rising of the Vendee and the wars of the Chouans, that were to grip the west for 
more than a decade. 

The rising in the Vendee engendered civil warfare that lasted for nearly three 
years. It broke out in March 1793 at St Florent-sur-Loire, but soon spread 
throughout the villages of the bocage. It was started by peasants such as J. 
Cathelineau, a hawker from Pin-en-Mauges, and J. N. Stofflet, a gamekeeper 
from Monlevrier, who had refused the draft; but it soon passed under the 
command of the local gentry-the Marquis de Bonchamps, the Marquis de 
Lescure, 'Monsieur Henri' de La Rochejacquelin, General Gigot d'Elbee, the 
Prince de Talmont. The 'Royal and Catholic Army of Saints' was armed with 
scythes, pitchforks, and fowling-pieces. It marched under a white standard 
spangled with lilies and the device of 'Vive Louis XVII'. Its fighters wore a 
scapulary round their necks, together with the badge of the Sacred Heart and 
Cross in flames. They fought twenty-one pitched battles, triumphed on the 
bloody field of Cholet, captured Angers, laid siege to Nantes, and broke into the 
provinces of Maine and Anjou. Their desperate courage was caught in the orders 
of'Monsieur Henri': 

Si j'avance, suivez-moi! Si je recule, tuez-moi! Si je meurs, vengez- 

moi!' 

(If I advance, follow me! If I retreat, kill me! If I die, avenge me!) 


In October 1793 the Vendeans embarked on their most ambitious and (as it 
proved) their most foolhardy gambit. Some 30,000 armed men, followed by 



several hundred thousand civilians of all ages, crossed the Loire and wended 
their way towards the coast of Normandy. Their destination was the little port of 
Granville, where they had been led to believe that a British fleet and an army of 
emigres would be waiting to greet them. But they were cruelly deceived: 
Granville was sealed. Rochejacquelin's attacks were beaten off; there was no 
sign of British ships. So the retreat began. As the columns straggled back along 
120 miles of winter roads, they fell prey to every form of misfortune and 
violence. Refused entry to the towns, they had to fight every inch of the way. 
Fifteen thousand died in the streets of Le Mans. They perished of cold and 
hunger. They were mercilessly robbed, raped, and hunted down by roving 
Republican forces. Those who reached the Loire found the bridges blockaded 
and the boats burned. Their fighters were split up and killed. The defenceless 
civilians could then be massacred with impunity. The end came at Savenay near 
Nantes, two days before Christmas. General Westermann, a client of Danton, 
reported to the Convention: 

The Vendee is no more ... I have buried it in the woods and marshes of Savenay ... According to your 
orders, I have trampled their children beneath our horses' feet; I have massacred their women, so they will 
no longer give birth to brigands. I do not have a single prisoner to reproach me. I have exterminated them 
all. The roads are sown with corpses. At Savenay, brigands are arriving all the time claiming to surrender, 

no 

and we are shooting them non-stop... Mercy is not a revolutionary sentiment.- 

The retreat of the Vendeans is known as 'la Viree de Galerne'. In the sheer scale 
of loss of life, it was not dissimilar to Napoleon's retreat from Moscow. 

By then the heartland of the Vendee was being harried by General Kleber 
and a Republican army transferred from the Rhine. Throughout 1794 the 
'infernal columns' of the Republic wreaked hateful revenge on the rebel villages. 
Tens of thousands were shot, guillotined, burned in their barns or their churches. 
At the harbour of Rochefort, several thousand non-juror priests were slowly 
starved to death on the decks of prison hulks. At Angers, thousands of prisoners 
were shot out of hand. At Nantes, thousands more were systematically drowned. 
Later, to contain resistance, a huge military fortress was planted in the centre of 
the troubled region with a garrison of 20,000. (First named Napoleon-Vendee 
when completed in 1808, it was renamed Bourbon-Vendee in 1815, and is now 
called Roche-sur-Yon.) Nearby, in the open fields, stands a cross to the memory 
of the last stand of the last commander of the Vendeans, the Chevalier de la 
Charette de la Contrie, who, expiring before the firing squad at Nantes, uttered 
one last cry of 'Vive le Roi!', [noyades] 


Thanks to the propaganda of the victorious RepubUc, 'Vendeeism' has been 
widely identified with peasant ignorance, religious superstition, and the rule of 
tyrannical priests. This picture is unfair. It is true that some of the Vendeans were 
driven in extremis to forms of mystical martyrdom, and also to excesses of their 
own. But their rebellion was not irrational. They had been subjected to many real 
assaults and humiliations, including the fashion for public mockery of religion. 
In any other country of Europe, their devotion to their traditional way of life 
would have been widely admired. Their moral integrity was well illustrated 
when the dying Bonchamps pardoned all his 5,000 prisoners. Their tragedy was 
to have taken up arms during the phase of extreme Jacobin fanaticism. Their 
enemies did not hesitate to employ genocidal measures, and then to cover the 
victims with calumny. Napoleon called them 'giants'. It has taken the best part of 
200 years for France to come to terms with this terrible story ofpopulicide* of 
genocide franco-frangais.- 


NOYADES 

In the spring of 1794, French Republican officers in Nantes had so many I 
rebels from the Vendee to kill that they didn't know how to do it. They had 
unleashed the 'infernal columns'; they had starved and massacred their 
captives; and they had been shooting batches of prisoners by the thousand. 
But it was not enough. They then hit on the idea of drowning. Nantes was an 
Atlantic slave port; and a fleet of large, shallow hulks was to hand. By 
sinking a loaded hulk in the river at night, and then refloating it, they devised 
an efficient and inconspicuous system of reusable death chambers. These 
were the terrible noyades. Necessity proved the mother of invention in the 
technology of death. 1 

A century and a half later, Nazi officers in occupied Poland faced a similar 
problem. They had so many Jews to kill that they couldn't cope. They had 
unleashed the Einsatzgruppen; they had starved Jews in crowded ghettos: at 
Sobibor, they had driven their victims round the countryside in railway 
wagons packed with quicklime. 2 But it was not enough. Then they hit on 
gassing. Initial trials using carbon monoxide in mobile vans proved 





unsatisfactory. But early in 1941, experiments using capsules of Zyklon-B in 
sealed chambers, together with advice from the leading German designers of 
crematoria, 3 promised a vast increase in capacity. Within a year, the Nazi SS 
was able to embark on a programme of industrialized genocide in purpose- 
built facilities. 4 

An eye-witness from the death-camp at Treblinka would later describe 
the process for interrogators at the Nuremberg Tribunal: 

[rajzman] Transports arrived there every day; sometimes three, four or five 
trains filled exclusively with Jews. Immediately after their arrival, the people 
had to line up on the platform-men, women and children separately. They 
were forced to strip immediately ... under the lashes of German whips. Then 
they were obliged to walk naked through the street to the gas chambers. 
What did the Germans call that street? 

Himmelfahrtstrasse [the way to heaven]. 

Please tell us, how long did a person live after arrival? 

The whole process of undressing and the walk down to the gas chambers 
lasted for the men eight to ten minutes, and for the women some fifteen 
minutes, because the women had to have their hair shaved off.... 

Please tell us, what was the subsequent aspect of the station of Treblinka? 
The Commander of the camp, Kurt Franz, built a first-class railroad station 
with signboards. The barracks where the clothing was stored had signs 
reading 'Restaurant', 'Ticket Office', 'Telegraph', and so forth ... 

A kind of make-believe station?... And tell us, how did the Germans behave 
when killing their victims? 

They brought an aged woman with her [pregnant] daughter to this building. 
Several Germans came to watch the delivery ... the grandmother begged to 
be killed. But of course, the newborn baby was killed first, then the child's 
mother, and finally the grandmother.... 

Tell us, witness, how many persons were exterminated in the camp on an 
average, daily. 

On an average, from ten to twelve thousand persons daily. 5 

A view might conceivably be entertained that the Nazi gas-chambers 
reflected a 'humane approach', akin to that of a well-regulated abattoir. If the 
sub-humans had to die, it was better that they die quickly rather than in 
protracted agony. In practice, there is no evidence that Nazi logic knew any 



such considerations. The operation of the Nazi death-camps was 
characterised by totally heartless efficiency and gratuitous bestiality. 


The 'death-factory' at Jasenovac in Croatia was operated by the Fascist 
Ustasa from 1942 to 1945. It became the object of intense propaganda in 
post-war Yugoslavia; and the official count of '700,000 victims, mainly 
Serbs' has since been called into question. 6 But there can be little doubt 
about the total absence at Jasenovac both of mercy and of modern 
technology. Sensational stories abound. But shooting or gassing might have 
been regarded as a blessed reprieve from death by mass clubbings, by 
immersion in boiling cauldrons, or by decapitation with handsaws. 


The 'Chouanneries' of 1793-1801 shared many of the basic motives of the 
Vendee rising; and they overlapped with it geographically. On the other hand, 
they were much more widespread, embracing the greater part of Brittany, 
Normandy, and Anjou; and, since they took to guerrilla warfare, they were much 
more prolonged. The Chouans took their name from the chat-huant or 
'catcalling' which was the favourite means of communication between peasant 
lads in the woods. Their first recognized leader, Jean Cottereau, a ranger from St 
Ouen-des-Toits near Le Mans, took the sobriquet of 'Jean Chouan'. To the 
Republican authorities they were simply 'brigands'; but they sustained three 
lengthy campaigns against all the forces which the Republic could muster. 

The first campaign (October 1793 to April 1795) was sparked off by the 
passage of the Vendeans through western Normandy, where 5,000 Chouans 
joined their ranks. It was eventually suspended by a truce whereby the Directory 
ordered an end to the prosecution of non-juror priests. The second campaign 
(June 1795 to April 1797) began with a daring raid on a republican arsenal at 
Pont-de-Buis in Brittany. It promised to become a war of regular armies when a 
royalist force was landed from British ships on the nearby Quiberon peninsula. 
But General Hoche proved more than equal to his task: after annihilating the 
landing force, he gradually pacified the countryside by combining religious 
toleration with ruthless military measures. The third campaign (September 1797 
to July 1801) was provoked by the Directory's decision to annul the electoral 
results in all the departements of the north and west where monarchist 
candidates had swept the board. It was marked by the renewed persecution of 




non-juror priests, and by a series of murderous local conflicts between Chouans 
and 'Bleus'. In 1799, under Georges Cadoudal (1771-1804) of Kerleano in 
Morbihan, the insurgents were able to coordinate their activities and briefly to 
occupy several cities, including Redon, Le Mans, Nantes, and St Brieuc. But 
their successes came to an end with the Consulship of Napoleon, who followed a 
similar strategy to that of Hoche. General hostilities ceased after the religious 
settlement introduced by the Concordat of 1801; but local bands of rebels 
continued to roam the backwoods until Cadoudal was caught and executed in 
1804.- [CHOUAN] 

No accurate account of the 'Counter-Revolution' can fail to take note of the 
rapidly shifting bench-marks. Constitutionalists who led the Revolution in 1789 
were already counted among the 'reactionaries' by 1792. One of the most 
determined waves of resistance, which sparked insurrections in Lyons, 
Marseilles, Bordeaux, and elsewhere in June 1793, was launched in support of 
the Girondins, who until recently had been the Jacobins' closest partners. Even 
the sansculottes, who won the right to a vote and to cheap bread, turned in time 
against their Jacobin patrons. Bonaparte, who was seen to have betrayed both the 
Bourbons and the Republic, attracted the hatred of both 'Whites' and 'Reds'. 
The explosion of an 'infernal machine' in Paris on 24 December 1800, which 
aimed to assassinate Bonaparte on his way to the opera, was the work of royalist 
emigres, but it was used to justify the execution of Jacobin and republican 
opponents. Any unsuccessful opponent could be condemned as 'reactionary', 

[ROUGE] 


CHOUAN 

For most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the local politics of the 
western region of the Departement of the Sarthe, beyond Le Mans, was 
dominated by a solid right-wing, anti-republican tradition. It stood in marked 
contrast to the region to the east, dominated by an equally solid left-wing, 
anti-clerical and pro-republican block, la zone rouge, which in the 1960s was 
still voting Communist. The pattern could not be attributed to social, 
landholding, or religious factors. According to France's leading rural 
historian, it can only be explained by the lingering trauma of the revolt of the 





Chouans of 1793-9. This is all the more remarkable since the cahiers de 
doleances of 1789 show that the most militant protests against tithe and 
clergy emanated from the west, not the east. The conduct of the 
revolutionary Republic was apparently so extreme that it converted its 
original supporters into implacable enemies. Electoral behaviour in the Fifth 
Republic was still being influenced by the mistakes of the First. 'It is 
impossible', wrote Fe Roy Fadurie, To explain the present by the present.' 1 
If this is true of one department of France, how much more does it apply to 
Europe as a whole? 


Violence is the one feature of the Revolution which its critics have always 
found most repulsive. It took many forms. Mob rule and lynching occurred from 
the start on 14 July 1789, when the heads of the Bastille's governor, du Faunay, 
and of fellow victims were paraded round Paris on pikes. Wanton attacks against 
the persons and property of priests and nobles were commonplace. There were 
random massacres, such as the slaughter in the Paris prisons in September 1792; 
there were many assassinations, such as that of Marat; and there were terrible 
revenge killings, such as were perpetrated in Marseilles after the fall of the 
Jacobins. None of these events was unique. But two aspects of revolutionary 
violence had no precedent: one was the sheer scale of military casualties that 
arose from the use of mass conscript armies; the other was the cold-blooded 
reign of political terror unleashed by the Jacobins. In the realm of mass 
psychology, both these phenomena were connected to the vast energies which 
sent a despondent and bankrupt nation on a twenty-year spree of enthusiastic 
conquest. They were both avoidable. 

The Reign of Terror was conceived by the (second) Committee of Public 
Safety and carried out as a deliberate instrument of policy. It was not confined to 
the destruction of the Revolution's active opponents. It was designed to create 
such a climate of fear and uncertainty that the very thought of opposition would 
be paralysed. Its twin weapons were to be found on the one hand in the Faw of 
Suspects of Prairial and, on the other, in the Revolutionary Tribunal. The former 
required all citizens to denounce anyone who might be suspected of harbouring 
ill will towards the authorities. Finked to the Faw of Maximum Prices, which 
turned the whole economic sphere into a source of potential crime, it exposed 
every French family to the possibility of sudden, baseless catastrophe. The latter 




law, which rarely issued anything but a summary death sentence, fed the 
guillotine with a constant supply of innocents. The total tally in Paris ran into 
tens of thousands. In the provinces, it was backed by military force. It is a 
sobering thought to realize that for every victim of the Terror killed in Paris there 
were ten who were killed in the Vendee. 

Yet the ethos of the Terror does not cease to amaze. It produced a climate of 
spies, informers, and unlimited suspicion. It produced the scenes of crowded 
tumbrils carting the condemned through hate-filled streets, of men and women 
facing death, alternately serene or wretchedly broken, of the ghoulish tricoteuses 
knitting away beside the guillotine as severed heads dropped into the nearby 
basket. Through the dire extremity of the circumstances, it produced a large 
repertoire of grim humour. Danton, when asked for his name and abode, replied: 
'I am Danton, a name tolerably well known. My abode is Le Neant 
[Annihilation]; but I shall live in the Pantheon of History/ Desmoulins, when 
asked for his age, said, 'My age is that of the bon sansculotte Jesus: a fatal age 
for revolutionaries.' He was 38. Louis XVI on the scaffold started an unfinished 
speech: 'I die innocent, and I forgive my enemies,' he began, 'I wish that my 
blood ...' Danton, in the same straits, said, 'Danton, no weakness'; then: 
'Executioner, show them my head; it's worth showing.' Robespierre, who had 
earlier taken a pistol shot through the jaw, could only shriek incoherendy. 


ROUGE 

The tricolour of 1789 was made up from the white of France's royal 
standard and the red and blue ensign of Paris. It was destined to become the 
flag of the French Republic. The same colours, arranged horizontally, were 
adopted by the Batavian Republic in 1794, in succession to the similar but 
much older flag of the United Provinces. 

But it was the red flag which the revolutionaries soon adopted. In Roman 
times, the red flag had signified war. Red was the colour of blood, fire, and 
magic. By tradition its modern career began in 1791, when the crowd 
attacking the Tuileries picked up a blood-soaked royal standard. Henceforth, 
'red' and 'white' were the accepted colour codes for revolution and counter¬ 
revolution. Stendhal used the variant of Le Rouge et le Noir for his depiction 




of the struggle between the radicals and the clerical reaction under the 
Restoration. 

The colour-coding of political movements has deep connotations. Red 
was taken up by Garibaldi's 'Thousand', by socialists, and most fervently by 
the Communists. Green, the colour of the land (and once of the 
Merovingians), was adopted by peasant parties, by Irish patriots, and much 
later by the environmentalists. 'True blue', once a Spanish epithet for 
aristocratic blood, suited British Tories and other conservatives. The 
Unionists preferred [orange] and the Liberals yellow. The Nazis, from the 
SA uniforms, were first known as 'Browns'. Later, from the uniform of the 
SS, they were associated with black, which for others was the traditional 
European colour for evil, death, and piracy. In their concentration camps, 
they forced prisoners to wear colour patches according to the scheme of Red 
= political; green = criminal; black = antisocial; pink = homosexual; violet = 
Jehovah's Witness; brown = gypsy; yellow = Jew. 1 

Ambiguities abound. In Catholic symbolism, red stands for martyrdom 
and cardinals, white for purity and chastity, blue for hope and for the Virgin 
Mary, and black for grief, the Dominicans, and the Jesuits. In the age of 
racial consciousness and political correctness, 'black is beautiful'; 'whites' 
are as unwelcome as 'dead males', 'redskins' have to be changed to 
'cardinals'; and the favourite metaphor is the rainbow. 


Many of the perpetrators of revolutionary violence, like Robespierre, met a 
violent death themselves. Westermann, the 'Butcher of the Vendee', died on the 
same scaffold as Danton. The Directory initiated trials which punished some of 
the more notorious sadists. 

Legislative reform followed the same broad trends as the Revolution itself, 
passing through constitutional, republican, and imperial phases. The effect was 
immensely confusing. The institutions of the old order were abolished, and 
replaced by abortive or short-lived expedients, which the Empire then 
overturned or modified for its own purposes. The eventual offspring often 
consisted of strange hybrid creatures, neither ancien fish nor revolutionary fowl. 
Hereditary nobility, for example, was abolished in 1789, together with the other 
social estates. Under the Republic, all people were reduced to the one rank, 




citoyen or citoyenne (citizen). Bonaparte introduced the idea of advancement by 
merit, la carriere ouverte awe talents; and the Empire adopted a hierarchical 
system of new ranks and titles, an aristocracy of princes, dukes, and counts, 
based on state service. The Legion d'Honneur (1802) was Napoleon's own idea 
for an order of merit. 

In religion, the civil establishment of the clergy (1790) turned all priests into 
salaried state officials, and sequestrated all Church property. The Republic 
persecuted the non-jurors, disestablished the constitutional Church, de- 
christianized public life by inventing its own secular Calendar and its own 
secular cults, such as the Worship of the Supreme Being in 1794 or the 
Theophilanthropy of 1796. Bonaparte, after humiliating the Papacy, officially 
reintroduced Roman Catholicism. The Concordat of July 1801 recognized it as 
the religion of most French people, whilst leaving Church appointments, 
salaries, and property at the disposition of the State. Pope Pius VII attended the 
Emperor's coronation at Notre Dame on 2 December 1804, but was too slow 
when Bonaparte placed the crown on his own head. Rightly or wrongly, Jean 
Bigot de Preamenau (1747-1825), Napoleon's minister of cults, gave his name 
to religious intolerance, [guillotin] 

In education, the former monopoly of Church schools was broken. Under the 
Empire, the system of centralized state schooling based on the Ministry in Paris 
and on lycees in all major towns gave French life one of its most characteristic 
institutions. 

In regional government, the old provinces were destroyed, together with their 
historic privileges and assemblies. The 83 smaller departements or districts, of 
1790, usually named after rivers or mountain ranges, were retained under the 
Empire and greatly increased in number. Their internal organization was 
remodelled by Napoleon, who set up the office of departmental Prefect. 

In the economic sphere, the Revolutionary regimes worked their way 
through a long series of experiments. In 1790 the Constituent Assembly, having 
abolished the old revenues, was forced to invent a number of new land, income, 
and property taxes. It financed the nationalization of Church property by issuing 
the famous assignats or state bonds, which steadily deteriorated into a highly 
devalued form of paper money. In 1793 the Jacobins adopted an economic 
programme designed to meet the demands of a mass army, of the Terror, and of 
their own social ideology. Their doctrine of 'a single will' was applied to 
economics no less than politics, and produced a state-run armaments industry; 



rigorous price control through the Law of the Maximum, and the cancellation of 
all peasant debts. After 1795 the Directory looked increasingly to plunder and 
tribute as a substitute for economic policy. Napoleon added the outlook of an 
old-fashioned Colbertian mercantilist. Grandiose public projects were made 
possible by the priority given to the regular inward flow of cash. 

Both the Republic and the Empire were opposed to free trade, and the long 
struggle with the British over the control of commercial shipping began during 
the first Coalition. In November 1806 Napoleon's Berlin Decree formally 
declared the British Isles to be in a state of blockade. 'I wish', he said, 'to 
conquer the sea by the power of the land.' The British response came in the 
Order in Council of 1807 forbidding all neutrals to trade with France, except 
under licence. This in turn provoked Napoleon's Milan Decree of December 
1807, threatening dire retribution on anyone following the British rules. The 
resultant Continental System was enforced in all countries occupied by the 
French, and was made a condition for Napoleon's co-operation with other 
countries such as Denmark, Sweden, and Russia. It gave Europe its first taste of 
a united economic community; but it also generated much of the resentment 
which undermined the French position. 

Taxation endured many vicissitudes. The old hated taxes and exemptions 
disappeared. The constitutional regime aimed at equitable and universal taxation 
for all; whilst the Jacobins excised the requirement whereby the franchise was 
limited to taxpayers. The Directory moved back towards a democracy of 
property-owners. Under the Empire, although centralized land taxes were more 
efficiently run, the tax burden, especially on the peasants, was enormous. 

The torrent of legislation in the 1790s caused a log-jam which could only be 
sorted out by systematic review and codification. Work started by the 
Convention in 1792 culminated in the towering Civil Code (1804), soon to be 
renamed the Code Napoleon. The Code replaced the 360 local codes in force in 
1789, and drove a middle path between the Roman law of the south and the 
customary law of the north, between the egalitarian principles of 1789 and the 
authoritarian, propertied reaction of the Directory. (Common law lost its place in 
the civil sphere.) The universal rights of citizenship, and of equality before the 
law, were confirmed. In family law, civil marriage and divorce were retained; but 
the equal division of property was limited to male heirs. Married women were 
judged 'incapable' of making contracts. This Code has profoundly influenced the 
social development of at least thirty countries. 



In the long run the Revolution probably had its greatest impact in the realm of 
pure ideas. Much of this detailed legislation was due for further revision after 
1815, or was applicable only in France. But many of the basic ideas, and ideals, 
remained in existence for all the world to contemplate, even where they found no 
immediate form of practical expression. Republicanism, for example, was 
defeated in France long before the restoration of the monarchy in 1814-15. But 
it remained alive to feed a tradition which reasserted itself in 1848-51, and took 
permanent hold of the country after 1871. Since monarchy was still the 
predominant mode of government in nineteenth-century Europe, the memory 
and example of the first French Republic of 1792-9 could not fail to offer 
powerful attractions. 

The idea of revolution itself was irrepressible, even where particular 
revolutionary movements were repressed. Prior to 1789 most Europeans held a 
static view of the political and social order, where change could at best be 
limited and gradual. After 1789 everyone knew that the world could be turned 
upside down, that determined men could mobilize the social forces and 
psychological motors which underlay the surface of the most tranquil society. 
This realization aroused widespread panic and, in some quarters, hope. It also 
gave a powerful spur to the growth of the social sciences. Henceforth, revolution 
was to be distinguished from all lesser forms of rebellion, jacquerie, or putsch. 

Counter-revolution, too, took flight. Henceforth, revolutionary creeds were 
to be balanced by their opposite numbers. Burke's Reflections (1790) in the 
English-speaking world and Goethe's in the German world were to have lasting 
influence. The theocentric Considerations (1796) of De Maistre, who saw the 
Revolution as the wrath of God, were to have a long progeny, stretching through 
the generations to Alexander Solzhenitsyn. All of them would share Burke's 
instinctive reaction against The antagonist world of madness, discord, vice, 
confusion, and unavailing sorrow'. 

The concept of human rights, if not invented by the French revolutionaries, 
was certainly given its strongest modern impetus. The Declaration of the Rights 
of Man and the Citizen carried forward constructs contained in England's Bill of 
Rights of 1689 and the fundamental declarations surrounding the independence 
of the USA. Battered and bruised, it survived as a lasting monument to the early 
idealism of the Revolution. Passed on 26 August 1789, 'in the presence and 
under the auspices of the Supreme Being', it consisted of a Preamble, in the style 
of its American predecessor, and of seventeen Articles listing Mankind's 



'natural, inalienable and sacred rights': 


I. Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions can 
only be founded on public utility. 

II. The purpose of every political association is the preservation of the natural 
and imprescriptible rights of men. These rights are liberty, property, and 
safety from, and resistance to, oppression. 

III. The principle of all sovereignty resides in the nation. No body of men, and 
no individual, can exercise authority which does not emanate directly 
therefrom. 

IV. Liberty consists in the ability to do anything which does not harm others. 

V. The Law can only forbid actions which are injurious to society... 

VI. The Law is the expression of the General Will... It should be the same for 
all, whether to protect or to punish. 

VII. No man can be accused, arrested, or detained except in those instances 
which are determined by law. 

VIII. The Law should only establish punishments which are strictly necessary. 
No person should be punished by retrospective legislation. 

IX. Every man [is] presumed innocent till found guilty... 

X. No person should be troubled for his opinions, even religious ones, so long 
as their manifestation does not threaten public order. 

XI. The free communication of thoughts and opinions is one of men's most 
precious rights. Every citizen, therefore, can write, speak, and publish 
freely, saving only the need to account for abuses defined by law. 

XII. A public force is required to guarantee the [above] rights. It is instituted 
for the benefit of all, not for the use of those to whom it is entrusted. 

XIII. Public taxation is indispensable for the upkeep of the forces and the 
administration. It should be divided among all citizens without distinction, 
according to their abilities. 

XIV. Citizens... have the right to approve the purposes, levels, and extent of 
taxation. 

XV. Society has the right to hold every public servant to account. 

XVI. Any society in which rights are not guaranteed nor powers separated does 
not have a constitution. 



XVII. Property being a sacred and inviolable right, no person can be deprived of 
it, except by public necessity, legal process, and just compensation.- 

Social convention held that the 'Rights of Man' automatically subsumed the 
rights of women. But several bold souls, including Cordorcet, disagreed, arguing 
that women had simply been neglected. In due course the original Declaration 
was joined by new ideas, notably about human rights in the social and economic 
sphere. Article XXI of the revised Declaration of June 1793 stated: 

Public assistance is a sacred obligation [dette]. Society owes subsistence to unfortunate citizens, whether in 
finding work for them, or in assuring the means of survival of those incapable of working.- 

Slavery was outlawed in 1794. Religious toleration was guaranteed, [femme] 

Naturally, the French version of human rights was greatly circumscribed by 
the dictatorial practices both of the Republic and of the Empire. After 1815 it 
continued to struggle against a strong, centralized, bureaucratic state. But its 
influence across Europe was far greater than the Anglo-Saxon version partly 
because French culture in general was more influential at this time and also 
because French soldiers had carried it all over the Continent in their knapsacks. 
Not for the first time did the agents of repression scatter the seeds of another 
liberation. 

Geographical variations in the patterns of revolution are often missed. Paris, 
though dominant, was not France. In Toulon, which was occupied by an Anglo- 
Spanish naval force in 1793, the port and the city were the scene of bitter 
fighting between royalists and republicans. At Marseilles, Bordeaux, and Lyons 
also, extended civil wars were fought, with the Red Terror of the Jacobins being 
matched by the 'White Terror' of 1794-5. In many areas royalist sentiment 
would probably have commanded majority support if only it could have been 
effectively organized. In the event the revolutionaries carried the day, partly 
through their superior and centralized military capacity and partly through the 
outbreak of war, which effectively tied the defence of the Revolution to the 
defence of France. Nowhere is this coincidence of patriotic and revolutionary 
fervour more evident than in the Chant de Guerre de I'Armee du Rhin (1792), 
the 'Battle-Song of the Army of the Rhine' alias La Marseillaise, which was 
destined, eighty years later, to become the national anthem of the French 
Republic, [strassburg] 

The concept of the modern state, in the sense of a centralized administration 


applying common laws uniformly to all citizens over the whole territory, 
received an enormous boost. Its elements had been growing for centuries, and 
not only in France. But ferocious levelling by the Jacobins and the energetic 
dictatorship of the Empire made greater inroads into French particularism in 
twenty years than absolute government had done in so many decades. What is 
more, by sweeping aside the entire museum of antiquated state structures in 
Europe, from the Holy Roman Empire to the Republic of Venice, the 
revolutionary armies cleared much of the ground for the administrative reforms 
of the nineteenth century. Again, nationalism was not created whole by the 
French Revolution (see Chapter X); but both the ideology of the nation and the 
consciousness of nationality were immensely strengthened in all those countries 
where the old order was overturned. 

Militarism-the belief that military force is a valid and effective instrument 
of policy-inevitably gained ground. Eighteenth-century warfare possessed 
rather limited objectives; and the greatest of its practitioners won more territory 
through diplomacy than on the battlefield. The French revolutionary armies, in 
contrast, came together after 1792 at a juncture when mass conscript armies, a 
war economy, and the enthusiasm of a nation in arms, could deliver results on a 
completely different scale. Although their eventual defeat may also have 
demonstrated the limitations of militarism, their seemingly invincible progress 
for almost a quarter of a century showed how much war could accomplish. This 
was the legacy of Lazare Carnot (1753-1823), the military engineer and 
administrator who was hailed the 'organizer of victory' under the Committees of 
Public Safety, the Directory, the Empire, and above all, Bonaparte. 'War is a 
violent condition,' wrote Carnot; 'one should make it a Voutrance or go home.' 

Revolutionary War, 1792-1815 

The prospect that revolution would provoke first civil and then international war 
was present from the start. Despite the formal renunciation of wars of conquest 
by France's Constituent Assembly in May 1790, there was not a monarch who 
could listen in comfort to the cries of 'Mort aux Tyrans', 'Death to the Tyrants', 
which echoed ever more loudly from the streets of Paris. Equally, there was not a 
revolutionary who slept easily amidst the hostile plots of the emigres and the 
monarchists. The wilful flaunting of authority created a general climate of 
unease. In 1791 the Pope openly condemned the Revolution. The challenge was 
taken up on the one hand by the Girondin J.-P. Brissot, who called for a people's 



crusade against 'the despots', and on the other by the Emperor Leopold, Marie 
Antoinette's brother, who, after meeting the Prussian and Saxon monarchs at 
Pillnitz, called for a league of princes 'to restore the honour of his Most 
Christian Majesty'. 


FEMME 

Olympe de gouges (1748-93). a butcher's daughter from Montauban, came 
to Paris as a young widow. Born Marie Gauzes, she refused to accept her 
married name, and invented her pen-name when she aspired to a literary 
career. She was writing plays and political pamphlets from the earliest days 
of the Revolution. Incensed by the exclusion of women from the 
Constitutional Assembly, she published Les Droits de la Femme et du 
Citoyen (1791) as a counterblast to the Rights of Man: 

I. Woman is born free, and remains equal to man in rights ... 

II. The aim of all political associations is to preserve the natural and 
inalien able rights of Woman and Man. These are: liberty, ownership, 
safety, and resistance to oppression. 

III. The principle of sovereignty resides in essence in the Nation, which is 
nothing other than the conjunction of Woman and Man. 

IV. ... The exercise of Woman's natural rights has no limit other than the 
tyranny of Man's opposing them. 

V. The laws of nature and reason forbid all actions harmful to society ... 

VI. The law must be the expression of the General Will; all citizens, 
female and male, should concur in its formation. All citizens, being 
equal in its eyes, must be equally eligible for all honours, positions, 
and posts ... with no distinction other than those of their virtues and 
talents. 

VII. ... Women obey the rigours of the law as men do. 

VIII. No one may be punished except by virtue of a law which was 
promulgated prior to the crime, and which is applicable to women. 

IX. Any woman found guilty will be dealt with in the full rigour of the 




law. 


X. No one should be persecuted for fundamental opinions. Woman has the 
right to mount the scaffold; she must equally have the right to mount 
the rostrum. 

XI. ... Any citizen may freely say 'I am the mother of your child' without 
any barbarous prejudice forcing her to hide the truth. 

XII. The guarantee of women's rights entails absolute service ... 

XIII. The contributions of Woman and Man to the upkeep of public services 
are equal. 

XIV. Female and male citizens have the same right to ascertain the need for 
taxes. 

XV. All women, united by their contributions with all men, have the right 
to demand an account of their administration from all public officials. 

XVI. Any society in which rights are not guaranteed, and powers not 
separated, has no constitution. 

XVII. Property is shared or divided equally by both sexes .. - 1 

This text, the founding charter of feminism, remained little more than a 
curiosity. After publicly daring to oppose Robespierre's Terror, its author 
met the guillotine. 

Anne-Josephe Therouingue de Mericourt (1758-1817), The Amazon of 
Liberty', came to Paris from Liege to advocate a more militant brand of 
feminism. She held that women should fight for the Revolution, to which 
end she organized a ferocious legion of female militia. 'Needles and 
spindles', she wrote in Les Frangaises devenues libres (1791), 'are not the 
only weapons which we know how to handle.' 

Mary Wollstonecraft (1759-97) came to Paris from London, where in her 
Vindication of the Rights of Man (1791) she had attacked Burke's 
Reflections. Her Vindication of the Rights of Women (1792) enlarged on the 
rationalist position of Olympe de Gouges. She was married to the political 
writer William Godwin, and died giving birth to a daughter who grew up to 
be the wife of the poet Shelley. 

The views of these radical feminist pioneers evoked little sympathy in 
leading revolutionary circles. Rousseau, who had set the tone, proposed a 
gender role combining the self-denying heroism of Roman matrons with a 



femininity that would encourage men to be more manly. The likes of de 
Gouges, Therouangue de Mericourt, Mme Roland, Charlotte Corday, or 
Cecile Renaud no more impressed Robespierre than the March of the 
Women to Versailles had impressed the King. In June 1793, women were 
expressly excluded from citizenship. 2 


The rulers of Russia, Austria, Sweden, Prussia, Saxony, and Spain were all in 
favour of active intervention. Their plans were strongly encouraged by Catherine 
the Great, who expressed the view that 'the affairs of France were the concern of 
all crowned heads'. Their ringleader, Gustavus III, masterminded the ill-starred 
flight to Varennes. He was already receiving subsidies from Russia when he was 
assassinated at a masked ball in Stockholm on 16 March 1792. Yet their greatest 
obstacle lay in the ambiguous position of Louis XVI, whose public 
pronouncements contradicted his secret correspondence, and who was 
simultaneously opposing and co-operating with the Revolution. In the event, the 
divided counsels of Louis's would-be rescuers caused sufficient delay for the 
revolutionaries to take the initiative into their own hands. In April 1792, with the 
King's acquiescence, they declared war on Austria and Prussia, [strassburg] 

The descent into war must be traced to one of the most dire decisions of 
Louis XVI's politique du pire. In the spring of 1792 it so happened that the court 
party and the extreme radicals were both bending the King's ear in favour of 
war. The Queen wanted war so that the Revolution could be defeated by her 
brother's international rescue force. The radicals wanted war so that the 
Brissotin faction might exploit a military triumph. So Louis took them at their 
word, spurning the advice both of his more moderate Girondin ministers and of 
the Jacobins. On 20 April 1792 ill-prepared French troops were ordered to cross 
the frontier and to invade the Austrian Netherlands. The results of Louis's 
gamble were not as any of its promoters had hoped. There was no immediate 
military confrontation. The Queen's rescue force was slow to materialize. The 
Brissot faction did not gain any lasting advantage, being overtaken during the 
summer by the Jacobins. Europe gradually lost all hope of a peaceful settlement. 
The King himself lost all credibility, his deposition was in progress before the 
first major battle took place at Valmy in September. 




STRASSBURG 


On 24 April 1792 news reached the French army at Strasbourg that war had 
been declared against the First Coalition. That night, during revels in the 
house of the Mayor of Strasbourg, a Captain of Engineers from the Jura, 
Claude-Josephe Rouget de Lisle (1760-1836), improvised both the words 
and the music of 'Le Chant de Guerre pour l'Armee du Rhin' (The Battle 
Song for the Army of the Rhine). Its rousing stanzas would soon be sung 
wherever the revolutionary cause was in danger: 

Allons, enfants de la Patrie! 

Le jour de gloire est arrive. 

Contre nous de la tyrannie 
L'etendard sanglant est leve, [bis] 

Entendez-vous dans les campagnes 

Mugir ees feroces soldats? 

lis viennent jusque dans nos bras 

Egorger nos fils et nos compagnes 

Aux armes, Citoyens! Formez vos bataillons! 

Marchons, marchons! 

Qu'un sang impur abreuve nos sillons. 

(Forward, children of the Fatherland! | The day of glory has arrived. | 
Tyranny's bloody standard has been raised against us. | [Repeat] Do you 
hear those ferocious soldiers bellowing in the countryside? | They are 
coming right into our embrace | To slaughter our sons and daughters. | To 
arms, citizens! Form up in your battalions! f Come on, let's march! | To 
water our furrows with tainted blood.) 

To be sung in Strasbourg, the song had to be translated into German as 
the Strassburgerlied. By the summer, as La Strasbourgeoise, it had reached 
the Midi. On the evening of 22 June it was sung at a banquet in Marseilles 
by a medical student from Montpellier, Francois Miroir. It proved so 
seductive that it accompanied a battalion of volunteers from Marseilles all 
the way to Paris. When they entered the capital on 30 July, singing their 
song, it was immediately called The Hymn of the Massilians', or simply La 
Marseillaise. There is no doubt about its subsequent career. But there is 
some doubt whether that battalion of volunteers from the Midi could actually 



have spoken French. 1 

La Marseillaise quickened the step of the revolutionary armies as they 
marched round Europe. It was translated and sung in many languages, from 
Italian to Polish. It was formally adopted by a decree of the Convention on 
26 Messidor III (14 July 1795), thereby initiating the custom of national as 
opposed to royal anthems (like 'God Save the King'). La Marseillaise, 
Napoleon used to say, was the Republic's greatest general. 

As for Rouget de Lisle, he was arrested in 1793 for royalist sympathies; 
survived; and died in poverty. His monument stands in Lons-le-Saunier. 


Russia alone showed no hesitation. The Empress Catherine was cramped by 
her Turkish war, which did not end until the Treaty of Jassy in January 1792. But 
after that she immediately turned her gaze to the West. Her contribution to the 
anti-revolutionary crusade was to be directed against the Polish Constitution, 
'which she could not for one minute accept': 

The Polish Constitution was in no sense Jacobinical. But to Catherine there was not, in spring 1791, much 
to choose between revolutionary Poland and revolutionary France ... [She] sensed the revolutionary 

or 

undercurrent in Poland... and she crushed the Revolution where she could most easily reach it.- 

Summoning a bogus confederation of traitorous Polish notables to St Petersburg, 
and pressing the King of Prussia to drop his Polish sympathies or else, she 
ordered the Russian army to march at precisely the time that Louis XVI was 
ordering the French army to do the same. Thus the revolutionary wars began 
simultaneously in East and West. Twenty years were to pass before the initiators, 
France and Russia, were to meet in the decisive trial of strength. 

The Russo-Polish War of 1792-3, therefore, was an integral part of the 
revolutionary panorama. It largely determined the balance of forces which were 
later to be waiting for Napoleon in the East. The outcome was not a foregone 
conclusion. Commanded by the King's nephew Jozef Poniatowski, and by the 
veteran of the American wars Tadeusz Kosciuszko, founder of West Point 
Academy, the fledgeling Polish army acquitted itself with distinction. A masterly 
victory was achieved at Zielence in Podolia on 18 June 1792, one month after 
Russian forces had crossed into Polish Ukraine. The Polish position continued to 
look tenable until surrounded by the Prussians from the rear. In the end, the 
matter was resolved by the King's capitulation rather than by force of arms. 





Joining the Russian-backed Confederation of Targowica to end the shedding of 
blood, Stanislaw-August accepted the terms of the Second Partition, signed in St 
Petersburg on 4 January 1793, and undertook to put them into effect. Six months 
later the last Sejm of the Republic's history met at Grodno in Lithuania, under 
the shadow of Russian guns. Representatives of the nobility, threatened with 
sequestration, gave legal form to their country's humiliation. The Constitution of 
Third May, duly reviled, was annulled. Russia annexed a swathe of territory half 
the size of France. Prussia took Danzig (which promptly rebelled), [tor] 


TOR 

The Brandenburger Tor was built as one of the nineteen gates of Berlin's 
old walled city in 1793, the year that the Kingdom of Prussia entered the 
revolutionary wars. Its elegant Doric colonnade was modelled on the 
Propyleia in Athens. Surmounted by its Auriga -a group of giant bronze 
figures portraying The Chariot of Victory'-it was destined to preside over 
Germany's modern tragedies and triumphs. It saw Napoleon's grand entry 
into Berlin in 1806, and all the other military parades which crashed and 
boomed their way along the avenue of Unter den Linden for King, Kaiser, 
President, and Fiihrer. In 1871, it welcomed the victorious troops returning 
from the Franco-Prussian War to a city still described as 'insanitary' and 
'irreligious'-an event which spurred the first rebuilding of Berlin as 
Germany's imperial capital. In 1933, it hosted Chancellor Hitler. During the 
Battle for Berlin in April-May 1945, it stood on the dividing-line between 
the rival Byelorussian and Ukrainian 'Fronts' commanded by Marshals 
Zhukov and Koniev. On the day when two Russian sergeants from Zhukov's 
army planted a red banner atop the nearby Reichstag, its ruins received a 
red-and-white pennant from soldiers of the 1st Polish Army fighting under 
Koniev. In 1953, it towered over the fatal protest march of East German 
workers. From August 1961 until November 1989, it formed the captive 
centrepiece of The Berlin Wall. 

Across the centuries, the Auriga has been seen as an unwitting 
weathercock of the political climate. In 1807 it was carried off to Paris. 
Restored in 1814, it was re-erected with the Chariot facing west. In 1945 it 




was destroyed only to be replaced in 1953 with new sculptures cast from the 
original moulds. This time the Communist authorities allegedly set the 
Chariot facing east. At all events, as the third rebuilding of Berlin began in 
1991, in preparation for the government of a re-united Germany, the Auriga 
was firmly facing westwards. Its stance marked the condition, not only of 
relations between the two halves of Berlin, but of the two halves of Europe. 1 

Symbolic gestures in bronze or stone can be found in many places. In 
Zagreb, for example, the statue of the Croatian champion, General Jelacic;, 
was first erected in the late 19th century with his accusing finger pointing 
unmistakably towards Budapest. In 1991, it was re-aligned to point towards 
Belgrade. In 1993, reports stated that it had been turned once more to point 
towards Knin, the capital of the self-styled Serbian Republic of Krajina. 


In the West, the revolutionary wars grew into a titanic complex of conflicts 
engulfing almost the whole Continent. The campaign of 1792 gave France a 
thorough scare which spurred the revolutionary leaders first to depose the King 
and then to organize an open-ended war effort. The initial French incursion into 
Austrian territory was soon reversed by the advance of Prussian and Austrian 
columns into France. But the vigorous political manifesto of the Duke of 
Brunswick was not accompanied by vigorous military action. The Prussians 
moved so slowly that Goethe, who was travelling with the detachment from 
Weimar, had time to set up his experiments on the psychological effects of 
cannon-balls. They were still in the Forest of Argonne, within twenty miles of 
the frontier, when, at the Battle of Valmy on 20 September 1792, they were 
repulsed by the famous 'revolutionary cannonade'. After that, war fed off the 
Revolution, and the Revolution fed off a successful war. Before the year was out 
the revolutionary armies were back in the Netherlands and had seized Savoy. 
They marched on and on and on, for nearly twenty years. 

The progress of the revolutionary wars is often described in terms of the three 
great coalitions mounted against France in 1793-6,1799-1801, and 1805-14. 
This is misleading, partly because each of the coalitions tended rapidly to 
disintegrate, and partly because fighting often continued in the intervals between 
the coalitions. The interests of the Continental powers which supplied the 
backbone of the coalitions' forces-Austria, Prussia, and Russia-did not always 




coincide with those of the coalitions' principal organizers, the British, and their 
great war minister, William Pitt the Younger (1759-1806). According to varying 
criteria, there were not just three but five, six, or seven coalitions. Britain's 
coalition partners repeatedly suffered invasion and occupation; the British, on 
their impregnable islands, did not. The conflict assumed important economic as 
well as military dimensions. On several occasions it spread beyond the confines 
of Europe, and showed signs of global, intercontinental strategy. 

The First Coalition, 1793-6, demonstrated how difficult it was to hold the 
allies together. Russia made little contribution, being preoccupied with the 
digestion of Poland. Prussia dropped out in 1795 for the same reason. Austria 
was left exposed to devastating French attacks both in the Netherlands and in 
northern Italy. In 1795-6 Spain changed sides, and Britain was left alone, with 
only the navy staving off disaster. The French, whilst destroying the Counter- 
Revolution at home, began to manufacture revolutionary regimes abroad. The 
Batavian Republic (1794) in the Dutch Netherlands was the first of many. The 
French also began to field youthful generals of astonishing skill and energies. Of 
these, the first was General Fazare Hoche (1769-97), who conquered the Rhine, 
crushed the Chouans, and once set out to capture Ireland. 

In the East, despite the Second Partition, Poland-Fithuania still refused to 
surrender. Early in 1794 Tadeusz Kosciuszko returned from exile, and on 24 
March, on the old Market Square of Cracow, read out the Act of Insurrection, 
Tor national self-rule... and for the general liberty' In May he issued a manifesto 
granting emancipation to the serfs. The victory of his peasant scythemen over a 
professional Russian army at Raclawice (4 April) echoed the Vendeans' triumph 
at Cholet. Yet in Warsaw and Wilno the mob went on the rampage. Popular 
courts sentenced bishops, Russian agents, and confederates to death. Here at last 
was open revolution: the monarchs had to act. Warsaw was besieged by 
Prussians in the west. Two Russian armies advanced from the east. On 10 
October, at Maciejowice, a wounded Kosciuszko fell from his horse, and was 
(wrongly) reported as crying 'Finis Poloniae'. Suvorov stormed Warsaw's 
eastern suburb of Praga, and put the inhabitants to the sword. He sent a three- 
word report to St Petersburg -hurrah, praga, suvorov, and received a three- 
word reply- bravo fieldmarshal, Catherine, [metryka] 

On this occasion the Third Partition proceeded on the assumption that the 
Poles and their Republic no longer existed; so, no consent was sought. The 
Prussians took Mazovia and Warsaw and called it 'New South Prussia'. The 



Austrians took another huge slice and called it 'New Galicia'. The Russians 
contented themselves with a slice the size of England. The final treaty, signed in 
St Petersburg, was followed by a secret protocol: 

In view of the necessity to abolish everything which could revive the memory of the existence of the 
Kingdom of Poland ... The high contracting parties are agreed ... never to include in their tides the name or 
designation of the Kingdom of Poland, which shall remain suppressed as from the present and forever.- 

By that time, with Bonaparte already on the march, no one in Western Europe 
could spare a thought for the injustices of Poland's fate. Russia had established 
its reputation as the most unbending opponent of revolution, the champion of 
monarchy. The Poles had been cast in their role as the most obdurate opponents 
of sound government. They were to supply the largest of numerous foreign 
contingents who fought in the French ranks throughout the revolutionary wars. 

The Italian campaign of 1796-7 was launched by the Directory against the 
possessions of an Austria already isolated by the collapse of its coalition 
partners. It was notable for the international debut of General Bonaparte, one 
year younger than Hoche. In the course of a few weeks the ragged French army 
on the frontier of the Maritime Alps was transformed into an invincible force. 
'Soldiers of the Army of Italy', the youngster told them, 'I will lead you into the 
most fertile plains in the world. You will find honour, glory and riches. Will you 
be wanting in courage?' Within twelve months the whole of northern Italy was 
overrun. Bonaparte's tactical mastery, first demonstrated on 10 May 1796 at the 
Bridge of Lodi, delivered him strategic domination. Milan was liberated; Mantua 
was reduced by siege; Austrian resistance was broken at Rivoli. The road was 
opened into Carinthia, and Vienna itself was awaiting attack, [grillenstein] 

Bonaparte showed an interest in all matters contiguous to war. Revolts and 
mutinies were repressed with swift and purposeful brutality. On entering the 
territory of the Duke of Parma, he demanded the instant surrender of all art 
treasures. This policy was to make the Louvre pre-eminent among art 
collections. On entering into the negotiations preceding the Peace of Campo 
Formio (October 1797) he insisted on dictating the terms without reference to 
Paris. This sort of conduct was to give him the upper hand over the politicians at 
home. 


METRYKA 


In 1795, after suppressing the Republic of Poland-Lithuania, the Russian 
army carried off the state archives of the conquered countries to St 
Petersburg. Their haul included the Metryka Koronna or 'Crown Register' of 
the Kingdom of Poland, containing copies of all acts, statutes, and charters 
issued by the royal chancery since the Middle Ages, together with similar 
collections from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Duchy of Mazovia. 
Since the catalogues and.indexes were also taken, no one in Warsaw knew 
exactly what was lost. Polish historians could not study the history of their 
country in the way that Prussians or Russians were doing throughout the 
nineteenth Century. The impression was created abroad that Poland's place 
in European history was as marginal as its role in the present. 

Attempts to identify, to reconstitute, and, if possible, to recover Poland's 
lost archives have been in progress for 200 years. Some parts were returned 
after 1815, and more after the Treaty of Riga in 1921. Other parts were 
pieced together from copies scattered far and wide. The Soviet Army 
reappropriated everything of interest in 1945, and only released selected 
items in the 1960s. No independent researchers were ever allowed to search 
for themselves unsupervised through the Tsarist or Soviet archives. 1 [loot] 

A detailed account of the fate of the Lithuanian Register, the Metryka 
Litewska, which dates from 1440, was only established by an American 
scholar in the 1980s. Working on an authorized survey of the Soviet archives 
for the benefit of Western scholars, and armed with a partial copy of the 
catalogues made in Warsaw by the invading Swedes in the seventeenth 
century, she painstakingly traced most of the constituent collections which 
Russian archivists had repeatedly relabelled, reassigned, and relocated. 2 Yet 
two centuries after it was stolen, the main part of the Lithuanian Register 
remained in St Petersburg. Appeals by the governments of Lithuania and 
Belarus' passed unheeded as the Russian Federation laid formal claim to all 
documents relating to 'the history of Russia' in the archives of the former 
RSFSR 'regardless of their place of preservation and their form of 
ownership'. 3 



Western historians have been trained to stress the principle of consulting 
documentary sources. This is sound advice wherever the documentary 
sources are accessible. They forget a still more important principle which the 
Russian authorities have well understood for centuries-namely, whoever 
controls the documents can also control their use and interpretation. 



GRILLENSTEIN 


In 1797 a son was bom to a family of peasant weavers in the village of I 
Grillenstein, parish of Gmiind, in Austria's Waldviertel district. The name of 
the family is not given, but their life cycle has been reconstructed from the 
parish records (see Appendix III, p. 1292). In 1817, at the age of twenty, the 
son married a woman six years older than himself, and by December at the 
latest the newly-weds had a baby son of their own. At that point the 
household appeared to constitute a perfect example of the classic 'stem- 
family' as posited by Le Play-a patriarchal, three-generational unit headed 
by the 51-year-old grandfather, [grossenmeer] 

Very soon, however, the picture changed. In the following year (1818), 
the grandfather went into retirement (Ausnahm), taking his wife and two 
unmarried teenage daughters with him and handing the headship of the 
household to his son. He continued to live somewhere on the farm for a 
further twelve years until, following his wife's death, he himself remarried 
and left. 

From 1818, therefore, the household bore very little resemblance to the 
stem-family model. For a dozen years the son took charge, free of parental 
authority but with his retired parents in the background. His family was 
increased by the births of three more children, but afflicted by the deaths of 
his elder son (1821), his mother (1826), and his younger, newborn daughter 
(1827). After the departure of his father and unmarried sisters (1830), he 
could only cope with the losses by taking in a series of weavers and their 
families plus a number of servants. By 1841, when his eldest surviving child 
reached twenty-one, the household contained three separate, unrelated 
families-the head's family and the families of two older weavers, who had 
just replaced two single women and their illegitimate sons. One can imagine 
the troubles. 1 

This one example was chosen by historians who wished to demonstrate 
the danger of generalizing from standard sociological models whilst 
observing the dynamic changes which occur over time. The family life 



cycle, which reveals the ebb and flow of fortune, is a vital concept for 
understanding peasant life throughout Europe and throughout the ages. 


The Egyptian campaign of 1798-9 was designed by the Directory to disrupt 
Britain's colonial and commercial supremacy. By establishing a French presence 
in the Middle East, it would have weakened British links with India and prepared 
the way for French domination of the whole Mediterranean. It began with the 
capture of Malta, and the landing of 40,000 troops at Alexandria. Despite the 
military defeat of the ruling Mamelukes, it was undermined by Admiral Nelson's 
destruction of the French fleet at Aboukir Bay (1799) and by a strategic alliance 
between Russia and the Ottomans. It was the predecessor of similarly abortive 
schemes to outflank the British in the Caribbean (1802), in America by the 
knockdown sale of Louisiana (1803), and even in Australia (1804). Nothing 
came to fruition, since the Royal Navy proved as invincible at sea as Bonaparte 
was on land. Bonaparte left Egypt in August 1799 to execute the Coup of 18 
Brumaire, and to take the reins of power in France. 

Nabulione Buonaparte (1769-1821)-like Hitler and Stalin-was a foreigner in 
the land which he came to dominate. He was born at Ajaccio in Corsica, one 
year after Louis XV had bought the island from Genoa. When he was sent to 
France for military education as a boy cadet, he had no personal wealth, no 
social connections, no competent command of the French language. He grew 
into a small, surly, assertive young man, with more than a hint of the native 
vendetta not far beneath his sallow skin. But France was 'a rebel mare', waiting 
to be tamed: 


O Corse a cheveux plats! Que la France etait belle 
Au grand soleil de messidor! 

C'etait une cavale indomptable et rebelle 
Sans frein d'acier ni renes d'or. 

(Oh, lank-haired Corsican! How fair was France I In the summer sun of 
Messidor! I She was a mare, rebellious and untameable, I With no steel bridle, 
nor reins of gold.)- 

The 'lank-haired Corsican' owed everything to the Revolution, which had made 





him a general of artillery at the age of 24. He had personally watched the 
shambles at the storming of the Tuileries. But he then took French leave to help 
his brothers in Corsica, and might well have stayed if the family had not been 
driven out by the local troubles. In 1794, having served at Toulon with 
Robespierre's brother, he was briefly arrested by the Thermidorians, and applied 
in vain for a commission with the Ottoman Sultan. Yet in 1795 he was on hand 
in Paris during the royalist riots of October, when he saved the Convention with 
the timely 'whiff of grapeshot'. 

After that, the once-suspect artilleryman could do no wrong. In 1796 he was 
given command of the ragged Army of Italy. He turned himself with equal speed 
into the master of his political superiors, correctly sensing that the fate of the 
government in Paris rested on good news from the battle-front. His support was 
openly courted by the faltering Directors, and his absence in Egypt during 1798- 
9 only strengthened his hand. The coup of 18 Brumaire, which made him the 
virtual dictator of France, was carried off without a hitch. It was the sort of feat 
which could only have been pulled off by a total outsider. From then on, through 
the consulships and the Empire, through the sea of blood of the forty battles 
which he claimed to have fought in self-defence, Napoleon never looked back. 
Surrounded by similar upstart marshals-Berthier, Massena, Macdonald, Murat, 
Soult, and Ney-and by similar brilliant ministers-Talleyrand, Gaudin, Fouche, 
and Clarke-he rode the French mare unerringly. 

And when France had been bridled by its Corsican rider, he saddled her by 
the rules of Corsican kinship with the whole tribe of Bonapartes: with Joseph, 
King of Naples and Spain; with Lucien, Prince of Canino; with Louis, King of 
Holland; with Jerome, King of Westphalia; with Elisa, Pauline, and Caroline- 
duchess, princess, and queen. He only stumbled on his own dynastic path. His 
marriage with Josephine de Beauharnais, a Creole from Martinique and the 
widow of an executed nobleman, produced no heir and ended in divorce. His 
Polish mistress, Maria Walewska, produced a son who was not recognized. His 
second wife, Marie-Louise of Austria, gave birth in 1811 to Napoleon II, King of 
Rome. By that time the clouds were gathering over 'the Sun of Messidor'. The 
first ruler of all Europe was already considering the invasion of Russia. 
According to Tocqueville, Napoleon was 'as great as a man can be without 
virtue', [Corsica] 

The Second Coalition, 1799-1801, was made possible by a new Tsar, Paul I, 
who was eager to play a more active role. Suvorov's Russian army recovered 



most of Austrian Italy before Bonaparte reappeared to restore the balance. But 
Paul I was assassinated; the Continental allies lost heart; and again Britain was 
left facing France alone. The allies' Treaty of Luneville (1801) was matched by 
Britain's Peace of Amiens (1802). 

After the collapse of the second Coalition, Bonaparte could take stock from a 
position of strength. He made further conquests in Italy, including Piedmont, 
Parma, and Piacenza. He sent an unsuccessful expedition to crush the revolt of 
Haiti; he invaded Germany, provoking the demise of the Holy Roman Empire: 
and he began collecting the Armee de l'Angleterre at Boulogne. He even began 
to scheme once again for the strategic encirclement of his principal adversaries. 
On 30 March 1805 he wrote to the Shah of Persia: 

Bonaparte, Emperor of the French to Feth Ali, Shah of the Persians, Greeting! 

I have reason to believe that the Jinn who preside over the destinies of states wish me to support the 
efforts which you are making to uphold the strength of your empire. 

Persia is the noblest country in Asia, France the premier empire of the West... 

But there also exist upon the earth, empires... [where] men are by birth restless, greedy, and envious. 
Tired of their deserts, the Russians trespass on the fairest parts of the Ottoman realm. The English, who are 
cast on an island that is not worth the smallest province of your empire... are establishing a Power in India, 
that grows more redoubtable every day. Those are the states to watch and fear.. .- 

Napoleon's high regard for the countries of Asia was not entirely insincere. 
During the Egyptian campaign, he had once said, 'Europe is a molehill. All great 
empires and revolutions have been in the Orient'.- But European affairs soon 
intervened. 

The Third Coalition, 1805-14, Pitt's final diplomatic masterpiece, was 
organized with the intention of a decisive showdown. Yet the showdown was 
slow in coming. At sea, the British victory off Cape Trafalgar (21 October 1805) 
ensured the total naval supremacy which would deny the French any chance of 
invading Britain. On land, in contrast, Napoleon utterly destroyed each of his 
enemies in turn. In 1805 Austerlitz ensured the total defeat of Austria and the 
retreat of Russia; in 1806 Jena and Auerstadt ensured the total crushing of 
Prussia; in 1807 Eylau and Friedland ensured the total withdrawal of all Russian 
troops. Within 18 months Vienna, Berlin, and Warsaw were all occupied. By the 
time that Napoleon made his peace with Russia and Prussia, aboard a raft on the 

River Niemen at Tilsit (July 1807), Britain stood alone for the third time, 
[SLAVKOV] 



SLAVKOV 


Slavkov, 'place of fame', is a small town 15 miles east of Brno in Moravia. 
On 2 December 1805, under its German name of Austerlitz, it provided the 
setting for the 'Battle of the Three Emperors', the most dramatic of 
Napoleon's victories. 

Napoleon, falling back before the advance of the combined forces of 
Austria and Russia, had drawn them on. Three allied columns marched 
against the French right in the dawn mists. 'Whilst they march to turn my 
right,' Napoleon had proclaimed, 'they present me with their flank.' 

Marshal Davout, whose men had just covered the 90 miles from Vienna 
in 48 hours, held off the main attack throughout the day against four times 
their number. At 10 a.m. the mist lifted, and the famous 'soleil d'Austerlitz' 
began to shine. The French seized the commanding height of the Pratzen 
plateau, from which they could rake all sectors of the field with cannon and 
cut the enemy forces in two. After the French Imperial Guard repulsed their 
Russian counterparts, the retreat began. By breaking the ice on the lakes in 
the valley, the French artillery cut the main line of escape. Amidst 20,000 
dead from 150,000, and as many prisoners, Napoleon savoured his finest 
hour. 'II vous suffira de dire', he told the survivors, 'j'etais a Austerlitz.' (It 
will be enough for you to say: 'I was at Austerlitz'.) 1 

The battle was painted by Gros, Vernet, Callet, Gerard. It was exalted in 
poetry. But no description matches that of Feo Tolstoy in Book III of War 
and Peace: 

When the sun broke through ... and the fields and mist were aglow with 
dazzling light... he drew the glove from his shapely white hand, made a 
signal with it to his marshal, and ordered the action to begin. 2 

Nowadays Austerlitz, like Waterloo, is a railway station, serving 
France's south-west. Military historians are less concerned to recount the 
plans of the generals than the emotions and experiences of the soldiers. 3 
None the less, it was the great battles which decided who was to be the 
master of all sorts of other things which constitute the past. 



Britain's activities, however, were more than enough to keep the wars alive. 
Through the Royal Navy's blockade, Britain was waging commercial war 
against all the countries recruited to Napoleon's Continental System (see below). 
What is more, by sending an army to northern Spain in 1808, thereby opposing 
Napoleon's recent takeovers both of Spain and Portugal, she internationalized 
the civil wars of the Iberian Peninsula, creating an 'Iron Duke' from the young 
Arthur Wellesley, and an important diversion that Napoleon could never muster 
the time or resources to subdue. 

One by one, and with painful delays, each of the members of the moribund 
Coalition began to revive. In 1808 parts of Italy joined Spain in rebelling against 
French rule. In 1809 Austria repudiated its agreement with Napoleon, only to be 
comprehensively crushed once more at Wagram (1809), within sight of Vienna. 
In 1810-12 Prussia started to stir, initially through secret, underground 
resistance. In the same period Russia grew tired of the French connection, fearful 
of Napoleon's plans for Poland-Lithuania, and irked, like everyone else, by the 
strictures of the Continental System. Napoleon was approaching the peak of his 
power, [violets] 

In the twenty years from 1792 to 1812, the map of Europe, and the system of 
states, was widely remodelled. The French Revolutionary armies introduced 
territorial and political changes of three sorts. 


VIOLETS 

In one year, 1810, Napoleon ordered 162 bottles of his favourite neroli- 
based cologne water from the parfumier Chardin. In a famous letter, he once 
begged Josephine not to bathe for two weeks before they met, so that he 
could enjoy all her natural aromas. When she died, he planted violets on her 
grave, and wore a locket made from them for the rest of his life. 1 He was an 
unabashed odomane. 

Smell, The mute sense', The olfactory dimension', was present throughout 
history, though much ignored by historians. 2 According to one theory, the 
male sex drive is spurred by the female odour of 'herring-brine', and by the 




urge to swim back into the primordial ocean. 3 Natural perfumes, such as 
ambergris, castoreum, civet, and musk, formed one of the most expensive 
sectors of the luxury trade from ancient times. The Middle Ages were filled 
with perfumed rushes and with incense, by the 165 petals of the rosary, the 
Virgin's flower. The French Revolution was pervaded by the whiff of the 
open sewers of Paris, the twentieth century by the stench of corpses in the 
trenches and the camps, the age of modernism by industrial pollution and by 
the arrival of the first artificial aldehyde, Chanel No. 5, in 1922. 


First, and at various times, they vastly extended the territory of France itself, 
by directly annexing large parts of the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, and 
Italy. By 1810 the 83 departments of the Republic had been increased to the 130 
departments of the Empire, with a population of 44 million. To the series of 
Aisne, Allier, Aude ... were added such novelties as 'Bouches de l'Elbe' 
(Hamburg), 'Simplon', and 'Tibre'. The Frenchness of the French Empire was 
diminishing with every annexation. (See Map p. 1291.) 

Secondly, a whole panoply of new states was erected, each closely tied to 
France and each possessing its own model constitution and French-style 
administration. These states included the Batavian Republic (1795-1804), 
transformed into the Kingdom of Holland (1804-10), the Kingdom of Etruria 
(1801-5), the Confederation of the Rhine (1806-13), the Grand Duchy of Berg 
(1806-13), the Kingdom of Westphalia (1807-13), the Grand Duchy of Warsaw 
(1806-13), five Italian republics, and the so-called Kingdom of (northern) Italy 
(1805-14). [ILLYRIA] 

Thirdly, after Napoleon's later conquests, a number of old-established states 
were allowed to survive, but with severely modified frontiers and with tightly 
controlled internal arrangements. These included Austria, Prussia, Spain, Naples, 
and Portugal. 

The only parts of Europe to escape the revolutionary remodelling of 
Napoleon's enlightened despotism were the British Isles, Scandinavia, Russia, 
and the Ottoman domains. With those exceptions, the whole of Europe was 
subject to radical changes that swept away the traditional order, giving its 
people, however briefly, a taste for something entirely different, [bouboulina] 

The degree to which the local population either welcomed or initiated the 




changes is a matter of some complexity. In some places they obviously rejoiced. 
There were deep-rooted republican elements in Holland and in Switzerland, for 
example, who had sought French intervention in advance; and there were good 
reasons why certain cities such as Brussels, Milan, or Warsaw should have 
manifested great enthusiasm. Elsewhere, the reception of the French must be 
graded from mixed to hostile. Napoleon was strong on the rhetoric of liberation 
but weak on its practical application. The benefits of emancipation for the serfs, 
and of republican rule, had to be weighed against the burdens of increased 
taxation and of merciless conscription. In several countries, and in Spain in 
particular, the arrival of the French provoked vicious civil strife. Many people in 
Europe who supported the Revolution in theory found it to be immensely 
oppressive in practice. 

The Napoleonic Netherlands led the way with France's foreign experiments. 
The Batavian Republic (1794) gave way for a Kingdom of Holland (1806) under 
Louis Bonaparte, before the whole of the Netherlands were directly annexed to 
the French Empire. Revolutionary ideas about the rights of nations affected 
Walloons, Flemings, and Dutch alike. They were due to surface in subsequent 
decades. 

Napoleonic Italy took form over several years in the course of complicated 
swings of fortune. Bonaparte's initial arrangements of 1797 were overthrown by 
the Second Coalition, but were reinstated and extended in subsequent 
campaigns. Five local republics formed in 1797-9-the Cisalpine in Lombardy, 
the Ligurian in Genoa, the Parthenopaean in Naples, and the Republics of Lucca 
and Rome- were flagships of the revolutionary order. They were joined by 
other transient entities such as the Principality of Piombino and the Kingdom of 
Etruria, until merged after 1805 either into the French Empire or into the 
Kingdom of Naples or into the Kingdom of (northern) Italy created for 
Napoleon's stepson, Eugene de Beauharnais. The abolition of the Papal States, 
and the maltreatment of the Popes, was specially shocking to contemporary 
opinion, particularly in Catholic countries. Pius VI (1775-99), who condemned 
the Rights of Man, was deprived of his temporal powers, and died in French 
custody at Valence. Pius VII (1800-23), who had once declared that Christianity 
was not incompatible with democracy, ended up for five years under French 
arrest for excommunicating all (unnamed) 'robbers of Peter's patrimony'. The 
Napoleonic experience greatly enhanced national sentiments in Italy, whilst 
preparing a sharp confrontation between frightened conservatives and a new 
generation of liberals. 



ILLYRIA 


Like many of the ephemeral creations of the Napoleonic Era, the Illyrian . 
Provinces of 1809-13 continued to exert their spell long after their formal 
disbandment. Attached to the French-run Kingdom of Italy, they included a 
long section of the Adriatic coast from Trieste to Dubrovnik as well as 
important parts of Carinthia, Carniola, Istria, Slovenia, Slavonia, and Kraina. 
Their French governor resided in the capital city of Ljubljana (Laibach). The 
brief interval of freedom from Habsburg rule was sufficient to fire both a 
long-lasting 'lllyrist' movement among the Slovenes and Croats, and a long- 
running Italian irredentist campaign for the return of Trieste and Fiume 
(Rijeka). (See Appendix III, p. 1231) 

After 1815, the special character of the region was underlined when 
Habsburg rule was restored within a separate 'Kingdom of Croatia- 
Slavonia'. This experiment came to an end in its turn amidst the troubles of 
1848-9, when the Ban of Croatia, General Jelacic, took his army into battle 
against the forces of the Hungarian National Rising. With some delay 
Croatia was rewarded with extensive autonomy within the Habsburgs' 
Kingdom of Hungary. 

'Illyrism' first gained momentum in the 1830s as a movement to protect 
all South Slavs in the Habsburg dominions from the mounting effects of 
foreign cultural domination. 1 It was strengthened by an attempt to impose 
Magyar as the official language of Croatia-Slavonia. From the mid-19th 
century, however, the national revival of the Slovenes based on Ljubljana, 
steadily diverged from that of the Croats based on Zagreb (Agram). The 
Slovenes, who found themselves after 1867 in the Austrian sector of the 
Dual Monarchy, cultivated and systematized their own distinct Slovenian 
language, which had possessed a fixed literary form since the Reformation. 2 
The Croat leaders, in contrast, chose to join a group of Serbian cultural 
activists, and with them to create a common literary language known as 
'Serbo-Croat'. They based it on the so-called 'shtokavsky' dialect, which 
uses sto as opposed to ca or kaj as the word for 'what'. At the same time, 
they fortified their separate national identity by emphasizing their 
attachment to Roman Catholicism (as opposed to Serbian Orthodoxy) and by 



writing Serbo-Croat in the Latin alphabet. 3 By 1918, both Slovenes and 
Croats had emerged as discrete but allied nationalities within the South Slav 
Movement. They both played a prominent role in the formation of the 
Yugoslav state 4 (see p. 979). [cravate] [makedon] [Sarajevo] 

After 1945, though the reconstructed Federation of Yugoslavia was 
completely subordinated to Tito's communists, Slovenia and Croatia aspired 
to autonomous status within the Federation alongside Serbia, Montenegro, 
Bosnia, and Macedonia. Slovenia, the smallest and wealthiest component, 
possessed a per capita GNP similar to that of Austria. In 1992, it led the field 
in gaining its independence. Croatia was less fortunate. Despite the support 
of the European Union, its declaration of sovereignty precipitated first a war 
with the Serbian-led rump of the Yugoslav Federation and then the violent 
fragmentation of Bosnia (see p. 1124). Only time will tell whether the 
fledgeling republics of Slovenia and Croatia will prove any less ephemeral 
than the long-forgotten Illyrian Provinces to which they had once belonged. 


Germany, like Italy, was built and unbuilt several times during the 
revolutionary wars. In the 1790s major changes were afoot owing to Prussian 
gains from the last two Partitions of Poland. Under Frederick-William II (r. 
1786-97), Prussia had even risked an alliance with Poland-Lithuania. But the 
logic of Russian power soon brought him back into line. By 1795, Berlin had 
acquired both Danzig and Warsaw, and found itself ruling over a population that 
was 40 per cent Slav and Catholic, with a very large number of Jews. One-fifth 
of Prussia's population were of immigrant origin. The brief reign in Warsaw of 
E. T. A. Hoffmann (1776-1822), did not pass without trace. The author of the 
Phantasiestiicke (1814) or 'Fantastic Tales', as chief administrator of New South 
Prussia, was personally responsible for inventing the frequently fantastic 
German surnames for Europe's largest Jewish community. Had Prussia been 
allowed to develop without intermption, it is hard to imagine what course 
German history might have taken. As it was, old Pmssia was overwhelmed by 
Napoleon, and the new Prussia, which reappeared in 1815 on a reconstructed 
territorial basis was a very different beast. 

Napoleonic Germany emerged in consequence of determined French efforts 
to break up the Holy Roman Empire in the period after the Second Coalition. 
The process began in 1803, with the secularization of the ecclesiastical states, 




and the reallocation of 112 other imperial cities and principalities to the benefit 
of Baden, Prussia, Wiirttemberg, and Bavaria. In 1804 350 imperial knights lost 
their independent status, whilst several of the more important princes upgraded 
their titles. Francis of Habsburg assumed the rank of Emperor of Austria, whilst 
his colleagues of Bavaria and Wiirttemberg declared themselves kings. In 1806 
sixteen princes of southern and western Germany formed a Confederation of the 
Rhine which was duty-bound to provide Napoleon with military assistance. 
Their leader, the Filrstenprimas, was Karl Theodor, Freiherr von Dalberg (1744- 
1817), Archbishop of Mainz and Grand Duke of Frankfurt. Since all these 
developments contravened the constitution of the Holy Roman Empire, the 
Empire's standing was damaged beyond repair. Napoleon found no difficulty in 
arranging its final liquidation in August 1806. In that same year, following Jena, 
Prussia collapsed, the King retiring to Konigsberg. Saxony joined the 
Confederation of the Rhine. In 1807, after the Peace of Tilsit, a Kingdom of 
Westphalia was carved out of Prussia's western possessions for Napoleon's 
brother Jerome; and Danzig was turned into a Free City. The rest of Prussia, 
including Berlin, remained under French occupation. Apart from the Nuremberg 
bookseller J. W. Palm, shot by the French for his pamphlet 'On Germany's 
Deepest Humiliation', and the Prussian major of hussars, Ferdinand von Schill, 
who led his regiment in a premature revolt in 1809, there were few martyrs. 


BOUBOULINA 

In 1801 a young widow from the island of Hydra near Athens married I 
Demetrios Bouboulis, a shipowner from the neighbouring island of Spetses. 
Her father had been arrested by the Ottomans after the Russian-backed 
rebellion of Count Orlov, and she herself was to be connected with the secret 
Philiki Etaireia or 'Company of Friends' based in the Greek suburb of 
Phanari in Istanbul. She came from a group of islands where Albanian was 
spoken, but where the Orthodox Church gave a sense of Greek identity. 
When Bouboulis was murdered by pirates, Laskarina Bouboulina (1771- 
1825) became a wealthy businesswoman in her own right, and a prominent 
patron of the Greek national movement. 1 

During the war of independence, Bouboulina plunged into the fray in 




person. She built a battleship, the Agamemnon, which took part in many 
actions. Dubbed 'the Captain', she fearlessly rode her white horse onto the 
battlefields, dispensing bullets, food, and encouragement. At the siege of 
Naphlion, she led the force which blockaded the castle and massacred the 
Ottoman garrison. But she has not escaped criticism. Unsympathetic 
historians have suggested that this idol of bourgeois nationalism ordered 
Turkish and Jewish women to be slaughtered for their jewellery, and that she 
melted down the cannons of Naphplion for profit. 

Greece's national struggle produced many stories of women's patriotism. 
The village of Souli in Epirus is specially venerated. After their menfolk 
were taken prisoner by the Ottomans in 1801, the women and children of the 
village gathered on the edge of a cliff to perform the dance of Zallongos. 
Each of the women led the swirling circle in turn, before leaping over the 
cliff to her death, till none were left. Modern Greek schoolgirls re-enact the 
dance, leaping off the stage onto a pile of mattresses, and singing the 
Zallongos song: 

Fish can't live on land, 

And flowers can't blossom on sand; 

The women of Souli can't understand 
Life without freedom. 

National heroines like Bouboulina have many counterparts. Her Polish 
contemporary, Emilia Plater (1806-31), a noblewoman, died fighting the 
Russians disguised as a man. Such figures are now seen as a diversion from 
the main feminist concerns. 

Bouboulina did not live to see Greek Independence. She was killed, not 
by Turks, but by an irate neighbour, who pushed a musket through his 
window during a row and shot her through the heart. 


But the Napoleonic experience, by destroying so many older particularisms, 
prepared the ground for Germany's unified national identity. Napoleon had 
commented cynically that Germany was always in the process of 'becoming, not 
being'. But he did much to change matters. The University of Berlin, founded in 
1810 during the French occupation, nourished the new thinking. Its first rector 




was the philosopher J. G. Fichte (1762-1814), author of the patriotic Reden an 
die deutsche Nation (1808). The 'War of Liberation' of 1813-14 proved 
specially exhilarating. The words of a song, 'Was ist das deutsche Vaterland?', 
written by the poet and historian Ernst Moritz Arndt (1769-1860), were on 
everyone's lips. Arndt, whose Geist der Zeit (1806) had first called for 
resistance, supposedly answered his own question: 'Germany is there wherever 
the German language resounds and sings hymns to God in Heaven.' In those 
same years the exiled Prussian Baron von Stein, who had visited St Petersburg 
and denounced Napoleon as 'the enemy of mankind', was inventing a precocious 
scheme for the federal union of the German peoples. 'Germany must assert 
itself', he wrote, 'in its strategic position between France and Russia.' Here was 

the kernel of the concepts both of Gross Deutschland and of Mitteleuropa. 
[CAUCASIA] 

Napoleonic Spain descended into a quagmire of disorder. The original 
French expedition of 1807 merely aimed to punish Portugal for its British ties. 
But anger was aroused in Spain by the presence of French garrisons and by the 
imposition of Napoleon's brother Joseph on the Spanish throne. From then, the 
tribulations of the French party multiplied. With the Portuguese entrenched 
behind the lines of Torres Vedras and the British sallying forth from their base at 
Corunna, with Madrid and many provincial centres in the hands of the 
opposition and much of the countryside in the grip of guerrilla warfare, the 
French found the costs of holding Spain steadily mounting. In 1808-9 flagging 
French fortunes were temporarily restored by Napoleon's personal intervention. 
But he had to leave; and every victory of his deputies, Soult and Massena, only 
served to increase the complications. In 1812 the anti-French liberals, besieged 
in Cadiz, succeeded in passing a liberal Constitution for the restoration of a 
limited monarchy. In 1813 the pro-French party succeeded in restoring the 
original monarch, Ferdinand VII. But it was all rather superfluous: by then 
Wellington was well on his way to the conquest of the whole Peninsula, 

[GUERRILLA] 


CAUCASIA 


The notion that all the peoples of Europe belonged to one white race which 
originated in the Caucasus can be traced to a learned professor at Gottingen, 




Johann Friedrich Blumenbach (1752-1840). Though patently false, it was 
destined to have a long career. 

Europeans brought up on the Bible and the classics had long been 
conditioned to look to the Caucasus for stories of their origins. The account 
of the Flood in the Book of Genesis states that The ark rested ... upon the 
mountains of Ararat' (Genesis 8: 4)-Ararat being a biblical name for 
Armenia. The legends of the Golden Fleece and of Prometheus were both 
Caucasian. But the ethnic and racial composition of the peoples of the 
Caucasus is complicated in the extreme (see Appendix III, p. 1298). There is 
no reason whatsoever to look to them as a source of racial purity. None of 
the more prominent sub-types from the Caucasus, such as the so-called 
Armenoid group, are well represented elsewhere in Europe. 

Blumenbach, a pioneer of comparative anatomy, and especially of 
craniometry or 'skull analysis', is generally credited with the invention of 
the 'five-race scheme'. It emerged from his study of an extensive skull 
collection that was published over a thirty-year period starting in 1798; 1 and 
it has passed into the realm of conventional wisdom. According to Blumen- 
bach's system, Caucasians represent the European and the highest racial type 
within the human species. Whilst the professor was studying ethnology, he 
was supplied with a skull from the Caucasus region, and considered it the 
finest standard of the human type. 2 Given this background, it is 
extraordinary to find that some governments still use the Caucasian category 
in their formulation of social policy and statistics. In South Africa, the 
spurious concept of a white race informed the oppressive and discriminatory 
legislation of apartheid until 1991. 

Apart from the white 'Caucasian race', Blumenbach identified a brown 
'Malayan race', a yellow 'Mongolian race', a black 'Negro race', and a red 
'American race'. His fivefold classification gained wider acceptance than the 
simpler white, brown, and yellow scheme of Baron G. L. Cuvier (1769- 
1852), another comparative anatomist working at the College de France. 

Somewhat later, the colour-coded classification of races was augmented 
by the notion of a complete racial hierarchy, within which white-skinned 
peoples of European origin occupied the top position. This development was 
first promoted in the work of Victor Courtet (1813-67), although the most 
influential exposition was made in the Essai sur Eine-galite des races 
humaines (1855) by Joseph-Arthur, Comte de Gobineau (1816-82). 'History 



shows', he wrote, 'that all civilisation derives from the white race, and that a 
society is great and brilliant only so far as it preserves the blood of the noble 
race that created it.' Interracial intercourse was equivalent to degeneracy. 
'Peoples degenerate only in consequence of the various admixtures of blood 
which they undergo.' 3 

Gobineau, who wrote a history of Persia, was also responsible for 
propagating the mistaken coincidence between the 'white race', which he 
saw as the progeny of the ancient Aryans or 'Iranians', and the Indo- 
European linguistic family. In this way he turned the spurious Aryan label 
into a partner and a rival for the older but equally spurious Caucasian one. 

'White', 'Caucasian', 'Aryan', and 'Europoid' all reflect the protracted 
search for an exclusive, and therefore non-existent, common denominator in 
the racial make-up of Europe's population. They form part of a wider 
vocabulary of doubtful terms including 'Black', 'Asian', 'Semitic', and 
'Hispanic', where physical, geographical, and cultural criteria are hopelessly 
confused. 

The great variety of physical types which exist within Europe's 
population has inspired many attempts to fix the boundaries of its constituent 
or regional subgroups. The flaxen-haired 'Nordic' 4 (adopted by Nazi 
ideology), the 'Ibero-Celtic', the 'Atlanto-Baltic' (which lumps the English 
with the Dutch and the north Germans), the 'Central European' (which 
includes both the majority of Germans and the majority of Russians), and the 
swarthy 'Indo-Mediterranean' can all be encountered in current reference 
works. These are only slightly less fanciful than the once fashionable 
practice of putting each modern nationality into its own racial group (see p. 
817). Even so, phrases such as 'the Island Race', 'German genes', or 'Polish 
Blood' have not yet passed from popular parlance, not to mention the 
'Daneskin' and the 'red-haired Irish', or the 'black dogs' and 'white ladies' 
with which European folklore abounds. 

Modern genetic science has progressed far beyond the methods and 
conclusions of the nineteenth-century pioneers. In this, the crucial step came 
with the demonstration of the workings of DNA in 1953. Generally 
speaking, the advances have emphasized the overwhelming mass of genetic 
material which all members of the human race hold in common and the 
immense number of characteristics that are encoded in the genes. 5 In a series 
of declarations between 1956 and 1964, UNESCO condemned the principal 



racial myths that had prevailed since the days of Blumenbach and 
Gobineau. 6 Racial and kinship differences have not been discounted. But the 
field has been cleared for a greater emphasis on cultural, religious, and 
socio-economic factors, for sophisticated genetic analysis based on proven 
scientific principles, and for the final dismissal of the old obsession with 
skins and skulls. 


Napoleonic Poland was a land of fervent enthusiasms and deep 
disillusionment. Napoleon's arrival in December 1806, and the creation of the 
self-governing Grand Duchy of Warsaw, aroused great excitement; but the 
changes fell very short of the expected restoration of the late Republic. In 1809 
the second defeat of the Austrians delivered Cracow to the Duchy; but no help 
was forthcoming for the recovery either of Danzig or of Lithuania and the 
provinces absorbed by Russia. Polish volunteers served in every stage of the 
Revolutionary wars, from the legions of Italy in 1796. But vicious financial 
exactions symbolized by the so-called Bayonne Sums, and the constant toll of 
conscripts, dead, and mutiles swelled popular resentments. Napoleon never 
revealed his ultimate intentions for Poland, even in 1812, when he briefly 
controlled almost the whole of historic Polish territory. His legend fared better in 
the Romantic times after his death than during his lifetime. When his most 
faithful lieutenant, Marshal Poniatowski, spurred his charger into the waters of 
the Eister at the end of the 'Battle of the Nations', he was expressing the despair 
of an exceedingly deceived and weary people. 


GUERRILLA 

In June 1808, laden with spoils after sacking Cordoba, the French General 
Dupont retreated towards Andujar and the passes of the Sierra Morena. He 
then found himself surrounded not only by the regular Army of Andalusia 
but also by armed bands of Andalusian peasants harrying his retreat from the 
rear. His surrender with 22,000 men gave notice that holding Spain would 
prove much more difficult than invading it. 





Throughout the Peninsular War, the French Army faced two sorts of 
conflict-one, the main military campaigns against Spanish, Portuguese, and 
British formations, and the other, the guerrilla or 'little war 5 against roaming 
bands of peasants. The second form of warfare proved specially vicious. The 
guerrilla bands avoided open battle, specializing instead in ambushes, night 
raids, and surprise attacks on isolated outposts. They provoked the French 
into murderous, collective reprisals on civilians. And they bequeathed their 
name to all who have emulated their methods. They showed how small 
bands of determined fighters could contest the overwhelming force of a 
professional army. 

The guerrillas of Napoleonic Spain have had many heirs, not least in the 
popular heroes of colonial wars and the backwood revolutionaries of Latin 
America. But they have had their disciples in Europe as well-in the 
Russian anarchists, in the partisans and maquisards of the Anti-Nazi 
Resistance Movement, and, with the IRA or ETA, in the 'urban guerrillas' of 
modern political terrorism. 1 

The only major dispute is one of precedence. In French historiography, 
the pride of place is not given to the Spanish guerrillas but to 'Jean Chouan' 
and his followers, that is, to Frenchmen who defied the might of the 
Republic more than a decade before French armies entered Spain. 2 


Great Britain, though free from French occupation, was shaken to its roots by 
the revolutionary wars. Indeed, whilst the external foe was repelled, there were 
moments when internal revolution loomed. In 1797-8 the coincidence of naval 
mutinies at Spithead and the Nore with the revolt of Wolfe Tone's United 
Irishmen was particularly menacing. Certainly the prosecution of almost 
constant war with France inhibited political reform. The Union of Great Britain 
with Ireland, for example, which came about in 1801 in consequence of Tone's 
defeat was marred by the postponement of promised Catholic emancipation for 
the best part of thirty years. At the same time the sense of British solidarity was 
greatly enhanced by the run of naval victories, and by the threats of French 
invasion, which on one occasion in 1798, in the remote extremity of Ireland, 
actually materialized. The prestige of Parliament was strengthened by the 
magnificent tussle between Pitt the Younger and his eloquent rival, Charles 
lames Fox (1749-1806). All the while, Britain's commercial, colonial, and 




economic strength continued to accrue. The tally of French, Spanish, and Dutch 
colonial prizes grew longer and longer. At home, the General Enclosure Act 
(1801) greatly accelerated the tempo of social change. The Caledonian Canal 
(1803-22) was constructed despite the war. And in 1811 the first of the Luddite 
attacks on machinery took place, in Nottingham. In that same year the old King 
was finally declared permanently insane, and was succeeded by his son, the 
Prince Regent. The Regency, 1811-20, proved to be one of the most splendid 
intervals in British architecture, patronage, and high society. 

Scandinavia, too, escaped the Revolution, but not the associated turbulence. 
Sweden was twice involved with wars against Russia. In 1788-90, after the 
naval victory at Svenskund, she came through unscathed. In 1808-9 she lost 
Finland and, in the ensuing debacle, her King, Gustav IV Adolphus (r. 1792- 
1809). The constitution of 1809 introduced a limited monarchy, and one of 
Napoleon's ex-marshals, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte (1763-1844), was invited to 
accept the throne as Charles XIV. He entered the anti-French coalition, 
participated in the war of liberation in Germany, and hived off Norway from 
Denmark, [norge] 

Denmark, on the other hand, had desperately tried to maintain a policy of 
neutrality, which twice earned her ruthless retaliation from Britain. Under the 
great reformer C. D. F. Reventlow (1748-1827), the Danish Enlightenment 
achieved many things, including the emancipation of the serfs, Jewish civil 
rights, free trade, and a free press. But it did not save the country from her 
neighbours. In April 1801 the Danish fleet was sunk at Copenhagen on the 
occasion when Nelson reputedly put the telescope to his blind eye and refused 
the signal to desist. In September 1807 Copenhagen was invested by the British 
and forced to capitulate. After that the Danes went over wholeheartedly to the 
French connection, for which they were duly punished by Bernadotte and by the 
Congress of Vienna. 


NORGE 


At the end of the Napoleonic Wars, when Denmark had clearly backed the 
losing side, Norway's leaders made their break from 400 years of Danish 
mle. On 17 May 1814 an assembly was convened at Eisvold, near 




Christiania, to declare Norway a sovereign, constitutional monarchy. The 
constitution was largely modelled on that of Spain (1812). The Danish 
governor of the country, Prince Christian Frederick, was unanimously 
acclaimed Norway's first king since 1389. 

The assembly at Eisvold, however, had not reckoned either with Sweden 
or with the King of Denmark. Ever since their loss of Finland in 1809, the 
Swedes had sought to acquire Norway in compensation; and the Danish 
King had unilaterally conceded their claim. Moreover, the Swedish army, 
under the heir to the throne, Bernadotte, was already on the march to enforce 
the agreement. After a fortnight's war, the Norwegians were obliged to 
accept a bargain whereby they could retain their constitution, and their 
separate Storthing or parliament, but not their king, within a joint Suedo- 
Norwegian realm. This settlement was enshrined in an Act of Union and 
confirmed at the Congress of Vienna. 

Henceforth, Norway's national movement was directed in the cultural 
sphere against Danish domination but in the political sphere against the 
union with Sweden. No amount of pressure could persuade the Norwegians 
to forgo their constitution; and ninety years of wrangles over foreign policy, 
over national flags, and, above all, over the powers of the Swedish king, 
soured the union. At one point the entire Norwegian cabinet was arraigned 
before the country's constitutional court, and the premier fined, for 
exceeding their rights. Finally, the Swedish government resigned itself to 
Norway's second declaration of independence. The Danish Prince Charles 
was unanimously elected king, and entered his capital on 25 November 
1905. The King took the name of Haakon VI, and the capital returned to its 
ancient name of Oslo. With some delay, the will of the assembly of Eisvold 
had finally prevailed. 1 


The Balkans lay beyond the sphere of direct French influence. The only 
region to be held and administered by the French were the so-called Illyrian 
Provinces- mainly modern Slovenia and Croatia, [illyria] But the breath of 
revolutionary and national ideas blew into all corners. Greece was strongly 
affected. In 1799 the 'Septinsular Republic' was set up with Russian assistance 
[heptanesos]; and when the larger part of the Parthenon frieze was carried off 
from Athens, there was an immediate outburst of national sentiment, [loot] In 




Serbia, two risings against Ottoman rule in 1804-13 and 1815-17 also received 
Russian support. In the Romanian principalities, the Russian occupation of 
1806-12, and the consequent cession of Bessarabia, caused resentments which 
only served to fuel national feelings, [bouboulina] 

The Russian Empire under Alexander I (r. 1801-25), grandson of Catherine 
the Great, experienced one of the most liberal eras of its history/Alexander's 
father Paul I (r. 1796-1801) had bordered on insanity: his internal policy was 
moved by vicious whims such as the reintroduction of corporal punishment for 
nobles and civil servants, and his external policy by personal flights of fancy. He 
left the Second Coalition in 1799 because of his desire to possess the Order of 
Malta; and in 1801 broke with Great Britain for no sound reason. He was 
murdered by drunken officers. After that, Alexander settled down to the long 
confrontation with Napoleon. Guided by his boyhood companion and chief 
minister, Prince Adam Czartoryski (1770-1861), a Polish nobleman once taken 
hostage by Catherine, he took a serious and intelligent interest in the political 
and social problems of the day. He had broad visions for the reconstruction of 
Europe, and showed genuine concern for the advantages of a constitutional 
monarchy.- He incorporated Finland as an autonomous Grand Duchy, liberated 
the landless serfs of the Baltic provinces; and for a couple of decades turned the 
western region annexed from Poland-Lithuania into the scene of a liberal social 
and cultural experiment centred on the University and educational district of 
Wilno.- He was responsible for the foundation of a state school system, and of 
the (advisory) Council of State which remained a central organ of Tsarist 
government thereafter. Russia was hardly amenable to the application of radical 
ideas; but a generation of Russian soldiers who were brought into direct contact 
with Poland, Italy, and eventually Paris itself could not fail to be a source of 
ferment. 

The Napoleonic Wars did not hinder Russia's territorial expansion eastwards. 
From 1801 the sixty-year conquest of the Caucasus began with the annexation of 
Georgia. In 1812, at the very time that Napoleon was approaching Moscow, a 
Russian expedition planted the tiny colony of Fort Ross on the coast of northern 
California-more than thirty years before American pioneers had reached the 
area.- [gagauz] 

With time, the strains of France's Continental System began to tell, as did the 
effects of the British blockade. They underlay the Tsar's alliance in March 1812 
with Sweden, and the deployment by Napoleon of a Grande Armee of some 


600,000 on the Tsar's western frontier. They equally provided the main bone of 
contention for the inglorious war of 1812-14 between Britain and the United 
States. American shipping was long trapped between the contradictory 
regulations of the British and the French; and in 1807 the boarding of the USS 
Chesapeake by a party from HMS Leopard gave grave offence. President 
Jefferson introduced his own regulations regarding 'peaceful coercion' and 'non¬ 
intercourse', but then gave way to the demands of the 'war hawks' of the Twelfth 
Congress. American forces failed to win any significant territory in Canada; and 
the British failed to reassert control over their former colonies. From a later 
perspective, it is ironic to reflect that the Continental System led both to the 
burning of the Executive Mansion in Washington, from 1814 known as the 
White House, and to the burning of Moscow. 


HEPTANESOS 

In March 1799 the French garrison on Corfu capitulated to a joint Russo- 
Turkish expeditionary force under Admiral Ushtakov. Corfu was the largest 
of the Heptanesos, the seven Ionian Islands, which the Treaty of Campo 
Formio had handed to France from the late Venetian Republic. (Its capture 
was the outcome of a rare example of Russo-Turkish co-operation inspired 
by Napoleon's invasion of Egypt.) Once established, the Russians shed their 
Ottoman allies and created a model 'septinsular republic' with its own 
parliament and a constitution (1803) designed by Tsar Alexander's chief 
minister, Prince A. J. Czartoryski. 1 The aim of their largesse was to outbid 
the 'revolutionary' French and to create the nucleus of a future Greek state. 
The arrangements lasted for only four years. The Ionian Islands reverted to 
French possession by the Treaty of Tilsit (see p. 733), only to be picked off 
one by one by the British Fleet from 1809 onwards. 

The British regime proved rather less liberal than its Russian-sponsored 
predecessor. An imposed constitution gave overriding powers to the 
governor. A handful of notables ran both the consultatory assembly and the 
oppressive colonia system of landholding. During the Greek War of 
Independence, the main British aim was to frustrate the islanders' desire to 
join Greece. In 1848 and 1849, Cephalonia was the scene of agrarian revolts, 




which the Governor, Sir Henry Ward, suppressed with mass arrests, 
floggings, and executions. At the very time that Palmerston was condemning 
the Austrians as 'the greatest brutes that ever called themselves the 
undeserved name of civilized men', and when General Heynau was 
unceremoniously dumped into a London horse-trough, Governor Ward was 
described in the House of Commons as 'the bloody Heynau of the Ionian 
Islands'. But to no avail. It was a fitting prelude to Palmerston's rough 
handling of the Don Pacifico Affair. 2 Union with Greece was ruled out as 
late as 1859, on the advice of the British commissioner, W. E. Gladstone. 
But it was conceded in 1864 as a face-saving gesture in the general 
settlement with Greece. During the crisis Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh had 
been offered and had rejected the Greek throne. It was a nice irony that the 
British monarchy would eventually also concede the defunct title of Duke of 
Edinburgh to an exiled Greek prince born on Corfu, [gotha] 


LOOT 

In 1799, the British Ambassador to the Ottoman Porte, Lord Elgin, visited 
Athens and acquired the finest sections of the Parthenon Frieze. The 
Parthenon had been used as an arsenal: much of it had been demolished by 
an explosion: and no one was trying to repair it. Elgin could argue that his 
deal with the Ottoman authorities was both legal and public-spirited. But the 
Athenians objected. One of the Greek leaders opposed to Ottoman rule had 
warned against selling Greece's treasures to the 'Europeans'. 'After all,' he 
wrote later, 'that is what we fought for.' 1 

The 'Elgin Marbles' constitute one of the prize exhibits of the British 
Museum; and some people consider them part of the British Heritage. 2 (If 
large chunks of Stonehenge had been legally transported to Athens, one 
might equally consider them part of the 'Heritage of Greece'.) 

Many European galleries and museums have been built on the proceeds of 
national or private loot. In the 17th century, the Swedes extracted vast 
quantities of art and valuables from Germany, Bohemia, and Poland. 




Napoleon was the Louvre's most ardent patron (see p. 722). Much of his 
archaeological loot from Egypt was looted in turn by the British. Much of 
the core collections of Russia's state libraries and museums was carried off 
from Poland. In the year that Lord Elgin was in Athens, General Suvorov's 
army was accompanied to Italy by trained teams of cultural procurers. 
Heavyweight political power has usually been accompanied by light fingers. 

In the twentieth century, the Nazis were generally considered the master 
art thieves. Goering thought himself a connoisseur; and Hitler, the ex-art 
student, was planning the world's largest art centre in his home town of Linz. 
Cracow, Paris, Florence, Ghent, and Amsterdam, and many lesser centres, 
were comprehensively robbed. Trainloads of loot reached the Reich from the 
East. At the end of the war, thousands of Europe's greatest art treasures were 
found in a disused salt-mine at Alt Aussee in Austria. 3 

Nazi plunder, however, represents less than half the story. The Nazis had 
nothing to teach the Russians about looting. Fifty years after the war, hoards 
of old masters and other Nazi booty, which the Red Army had plundered 
from the German plunderers, started to come to light in Russia. The so- 
called golden 'Mask of Agamemnon' from Mycenae, for example, and the 
16,000 items of 'Priam's Treasure' from Troy, once brought to Berlin by 
Schliemann, were all located in 1991 in Moscow. 4 Unknown except to the 
KGB and a handful of conservationists, these 'trophies' and 'special finds' 
had been secretly held for half a century in the Hermitage and the Pushkin 
Museum and the monastery at Zagorsk. For the most part they derived from 
private collections such as those of Herzog and Hatvany in Budapest, of 
Franz Koenigs in Amsterdam, or of the Krebs Foundation in Mannheim. The 
talk was of a million works of art. The problem, as with the British Museum, 
was to persuade the Russian finders that finding is different from keeping. 

Not that the other Allies were beyond suspicion. Berlin's collection of 
Mozartiana, which had been taken to Poland during the war for safety, did 
not return from the University Library in Cracow. In 1990, priceless items 
from the 'Ouedlingburg Treasure', including a ninth-century illuminated 
German Bible in jewel-encrusted binding, were found in a Texas garage 
once owned by an ex-US Army lieutenant. 5 

Needless to say, the legal concept of 'cultural property', as enshrined in the 
Hague Convention of 1954, is a relatively recent innovation. 6 



The Russian campaign of 1812 was, as he later admitted, Napoleon's greatest 
mistake. He called it his 'Polish War', since most of the action took place on 
traditional Polish territory and since a successful outcome would inevitably have 
raised the question of restoring Poland-Lithuania. The frontier which the Grande 
Armee crossed on 22 June 1812 had only recently become the frontier of the 
Russian Empire. In the eyes of the local inhabitants, it was the historic border 
linking Poland with Lithuania, [mir] Napoleon was faced with a clear choice 
between a political campaign, in which he could have used the army to liberate 
the serfs and to mobilize the anti-Russian sentiments of the population, or a 
purely military campaign, in which the outcome was left exclusively to the 
fortunes of war. He noticed that the Poles of Lithuania were rather different from 
the Poles of Warsaw. So, like Charles XII before him, and Hitler later, he chose 
to ignore local conditions and paid the price. Keeping all thoughts of the political 
future to himself, he pressed on through Lithuania to the heart of Muscovy. At 
Borodino, at the gates of Moscow, he suffered the most costly of all his victories. 
Moscow was occupied, but burned together with much of its stores. The Tsar 
simply refused to negotiate, and ordered his army to avoid any major 
engagement. In November, with starvation pending, the retreat was sounded. The 
columns of the Grande Armee, stretched out over 500 miles, fell victim to the 
Russian winter, to marauding Cossacks, and to the unseasonal floods of the 
Berezina. Napoleon fled by sledge to Warsaw, and on to Paris. As for his men, of 
the 600,000 who had crossed the Niemen in June barely one in twenty survived 
to tell the terrible tale. As the Emperor once remarked, 'All empires die of 
indigestion', [malet] [spa-sit'el] 


GAGAUZ 

Shortly after the Russian conquest of Bessarabia in 1812, the Tsar's new 
province attracted a wave of immigration. Among the migrants came a group 
of Balkan Christians known as Gagauz. They came from an area of what is 
now northern Bulgaria, and they settled in the district of Komrat, in what is 
now Moldavia. Their language belongs to the Ghoz branch of Turkic, and 




has counterparts in Central Asia. Their religious allegiance was to Slavic 
Rite Bulgarian Orthodoxy. It is an open question whether they left their 
ancestral homeland more from hope than from fear. A number of Gagauz 
communities, which were Moslem, stayed behind under Ottoman rule in 
Bulgaria. 

There are two views about the earlier history of the Gagauz. One 
maintains that they were medieval Turks who had been partially bulgarized. 
The other holds that they were turkicized Bulgars, who kept their religion 
when they lost their language. Neither really fits the facts. 1 

The Gagauz were just one of several such minorities in eastern Europe 
who straddled the Christian-Muslim divide. 2 The Muslim Tartars of the 
Volga contained a baptised minority, the Kryeshens, who had adopted the 
religion of their Russian conquerors. The Chechens of the North Caucasus, 
though mainly Moslem, also included some Christians. The Abkhazians 
were in a similar position [Abkhazia], Albanian Muslims, though a majority 
both in Albania and in Serbia's Kossovo province (see Appendix III, p. 
1310), form an important minority in Macedonia, [makedon] [shqiperia] 

On either side of the Rhodope Mountains, on the borders of Bulgaria and 
Greece, there lives a substantial community of Bulgarian-speaking Muslims 
known as Pomaks. They have outlying relations in parts of Macedonia and 
Albania. Their existence in Greece is not officially admitted. In 1876, it may 
have been the local Pomak militia rather than the professional Ottoman army 
which perpetrated what Mr Gladstone denounced as 'the Bulgarian Horrors'. 
If so, they were amply repaid amidst the horrors of the subsequent Balkan 
Wars. But they never left. 3 

In Bosnia, religion is the only criterion to divide the Bosnian Muslims 
from Orthodox 'Serbs' and Catholic 'Croats'. All speak the same 'Serbo- 
Croat' language, and all are Slavs. The Bosnian Muslims (44 per cent of the 
population in 1991) are often viewed by nationalistic neighbours as 
renegades who abandoned Catholicism or Orthodoxy in favour of the 
religion of the ruling Ottomans. In fact, it is likely that prior to adopting 
Islam many such Bosnian families had been Patarenes. [bogumil] 

In the late 20th century these little-known peoples repeatedly hit the 
European headlines. In the mid-1980s, Bulgaria's fading communist regime 
made a last desperate attempt to maintain control by launching an ultra¬ 
nationalist campaign called 'the Process for Rebirth'. Mosques were 



destroyed; and Bulgaria's Muslim minorities-Gagauz, Pomaks, and Turks 
-were forced to choose between changing their names or emigrating. Many 
chose to emigrate. In 1991, when Moldavia declared independence, the 
Gagauz of Komrat, by then some 200,000 strong, were reluctant to 
participate. The Chechens defiantly raised the standard of independence 
from Russia by proclaiming their own national republic in Grozny, whilst the 
Volga Tatars in Kazan prepared for 'Tatarstan'. 

In 1992, amidst the rapid disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Government 
of Bosnia declared itself independent in the hope of maintaining the integrity 
of a multinational republic. It received international recognition, but no 
significant international aid or protection. The presence of Western charities 
and of token UN peace-keeping forces did nothing to restrain the orgy of 
land-grabbing, communal massacres, and 'ethnic cleansing' which ensued. A 
self-styled Serbian Republic of Bosnia based at Pale mirrored the self-styled 
Serbian Republic of Krajina based at Knin, which had been set up in the 
lands of the old Habsburg military frontier in Croatia. Within a year, Serbs 
representing 31 per cent of the population had seized 77 per cent of the 
territory. Sarajevo, like several other enclaves, was besieged. Croat attacks 
drove Muslims from mixed western districts like Mostar, whilst Serbs fled 
the Muslim-dominated districts in the centre. Perhaps a quarter of a million 
people perished. World leaders whistled whilst Bosnia burned. In the 
absence of decisive statesmanship, the dissolution of Communism was 
having the same sort of effect as the Ottoman retreat nearly two hundred 
years before. 4 [Sarajevo] 


The terminal campaigns of 1813 and 1814 were decided as much by logistics 
as by performance in battle. Although Napoleon's forces were comprehensively 
overwhelmed at the three-day 'Battle of the Nations' near Leipzig in October 
1813, he continued to win the great majority of subsequent engagements. But he 
was facing the collective will of peoples whose sense of nationality he had 
helped to arouse, as well as the determination of the dynasts to restore their 
supremacy. The advance of the Russians, Prussians, and Austrians from the east, 
and of Wellington from the south, could not be stemmed. The toll of young 
French lives was inexorable. In those last two years Napoleon lost over a million 
men, even though he had failed to trap his foes into another concerted combat. 




The moment came when the Emperor was told that the soldiers would fight no 
more. In April 1814, with the British, Russians, and Prussians encamped in 
Paris, Napoleon abdicated. The Revolutionary wars, and the Revolution, were 
over. Or so it appeared. 


MIR 

In July 1812, as General Platov withdrew into Byelorussia before the I 
Grande Armee, his Cossacks placed barrels of gunpowder under the castle 
walls of Mir and blew them to pieces. Jerome Napoleon, King of Westphalia, 
used the place as his HO for a few days on his way to Moscow. But on 10- 
11 November, when the Tsar's army returned, a desperate fight with the 
retreating French compounded the damage. 1 

Mir had long been one of the great fortresses of the Polish-Lithuanian 
borders, one of the most easterly feudal castles in Europe. Once a stronghold 
of the grand dukes of Lithuania, it passed into private hands in 1434. The 
massive fortifications were completed c.1500 under Jerzy I lllinicz, Marshal 
of Lithuania, and his son Jerzy II, a Count of the Holy Roman Empire. Five 
lofty bastions in red brick were joined by a battlemented wall. They were 
protected by a horseshoe barbican and surrounded by ditch and moat. From 
1569, the central keep was turned by Prince M. K. Radziwitt into a grand 
Renaissance palace in finished stone. Until 1812, it served with 
neighbouring Nieewiez as one of the Radziwills' two principal seats. 

In its long life Mir saw many military actions. It was plundered by the 
Teutonic Knights in 1395, twice raided by Tartars in the fifteenth century, 
captured by the Swedes in 1655, burned by Charles XII in 1706, and 
stormed by the Russians in 1794. 

The great days of Mir came with Prince Karol Radziwiii, 'Panie 
Kochanku' (1734-90), who restored the palace after the depredations of the 
Swedish wars. It was the 'key' property in a huge complex of estates worked 
by thousands of Byelorussian serfs. The Catholic church and the Greek 
Catholic (Uniate) church adjoined the Jewish synagogue and Tartar mosque. 
The annual horse-fair was run by a large community of gypsies whose 'king' 
was traditionally crowned by the Prince. In 1761 the palace hosted a 




stupendous orgy during a session of the Grand Duchy's Tribunal. In 1785 it 
saw a grand reception for the last King of Poland. Russian rule began at the 
Second Partition in 1793. The gypsies promptly migrated en masse to 
Moldavia. The Radziwills left for their properties in Prussia. After 1812, 
only the ruins remained. 

Mir lived on, however, immortalized by the epic poem, Pan Tadeusz, of 
Adam Mickiewicz. The poet had the palace of Mir in mind when he 
described Lithuania's 'Last Supper'. Filled with hope and goodwill at the 
prospect of liberation by Napoleon, the local nobles gathered for a dazzling 
banquet. Lords and ladies danced the polonez. They were entertained on the 
cymbals by Jankiel the Jew, 'who loved his country like a Pole'. At the end 
they raised their glasses to the old Polish toast, Kochajmy Sie! 'Let us love 
one another!' 2 


MALET 

At 3 a.m. on 23 October 1812, a man wearing the full dress uniform of an . 
imperial general arrived at the Popincourt barracks in Paris and demanded an 
urgent interview with the Commandant of the National Guard. Introducing 
himself as General Lamotte, the new Military Governor, he announced that 
Napoleon had been killed in Moscow, that an emergency session of the 
Senate had declared a Provisional Republic, and that the National Guard 
must assemble forthwith in the Place Vendome. Handing the Commandant a 
certificate of promotion, he ordered him to take charge of other units and 
then to secure the release of two state prisoners, Generals Guidal and 
Ladurie. His instructions were supported by an impressive file of decrees. 

For several hours the plan proceeded smoothly. 'General Lamotte' did 
the rounds of the Paris garrison without opposition. So did General Ladurie. 
General Guidal settled for a good meal in a restaurant. But no fewer than 
thirteen senior officers took the orders of the non-existent Provisional 
Republic. The officer commanding the Luxembourg Palace, where the 
emergency session of the Senate had supposedly taken place, saw nothing 


amiss. 




Things only went wrong when a large part of the National Guard was 
already drawn up in the Place Vendome. At a private interview with General 
Hulin, whom Lamotte was replacing, 'Lamotte' was challenged to produce 
his own orders. Instead, he shot Hulin through the head. Shortly after, 
meeting another group of officers, he was recognized by a former comrade, 
who shouted, 'That's not Lamotte, it's Malet'. Overpowered, the chief 
conspirator was disarmed and unmasked. 

Claude-Fran^ois Malet (1754-1812), a native of the Jura, was a 
brigadier-general with strong Jacobin convictions. Long removed from 
active service, he had been held in detention for ill-concealed hostility to 
Napoleon. He had laid his plans with the help of a fellow detainee, the Abbe 
Lafon, an ultramontane royalist, who forged the documents. His wife hired 
the uniforms from a theatrical outfitter. The real Lamotte was a republican 
general living in exile in the USA. 

Malet and Lafon had climbed the wall of their gaol at midnight. Malet 
went home to dress up, before heading for Popincourt. Lafon disappeared 
until after the Restoration. At the court martial Malet took sole 
responsibility, but could not save those who had fallen for his ruse. His last 
request was to give the order to his own firing-squad. 1 

The Malet incident revealed the truth about Napoleon's Empire. Malet 
had calculated correctly that the Empire's fate hung on one man's life. The 
minute that Napoleon was assumed dead, no one thought of the King of 
Rome or the Napoleonic succession. As a result, France was very nearly 
returned to the Republic with only one shot fired. 'Minor incidents' can have 
the potential to make major changes to the course of history. 


One might have thought that the result of the Revolutionary wars was plain 
enough. Yet in the eyes of the historian who studied the subject most 
exhaustively, the Allies did" not achieve outright victory. 'The European 
coalition did triumph in the end over the French armies,' he wrote; 'yet one 
cannot say that France was defeated by the struggle.'- He was thinking no 
doubt of the maintenance of France's territorial integrity, of the continuing force 
of Revolutionary ideas, and of the surprises still to come. 

Everyone accepted that the fate of a whole continent had been at stake. 





Napoleon loved to talk of'Europe'. When he mentioned it at Tilsit, the Tsar had 
picked it up. 'Europe/ asked Alexander I, 'what's that?' Then he gave his own 
answer: 'Europe is us' (meaning, presumably, the ruling princes). In the spring of 
1814, when he was riding towards Paris, he said, 'I have come to reconcile 
France with Europe.' That reconciliation took rather longer than expected. 


SPASIT'EL 

In 1812, to celebrate Russia's salvation from Napoleon, Alexander I I 
decreed that Moscow be adorned by a church dedicated to Christ the 
Saviour. The project was brought to fruition by a committee convened by 
Nicholas I. Works began on the riverside, close to the Kremlin, in 1837. The 
design, by Konstanty Ton, an architect of railway stations, envisaged a 
colossal cruciform basilica surmounted by five domes, a giant bronze 
cupola, and a soaring pinnacle cross. The interior was gilded with 422 
kilograms of pure gold. The belfry housed the largest bells in Russia. The 
exterior was clad with sheets of Podolian marble and Finnish granite. After 
forty-five years' labour, the Khram Khristusa Spasit'yel'ya or 'Saviour's 
Temple' was consecrated in the presence of Tsar Alexander III on 26 May 
1883. 

On 18 July 1931 Pravda announced that a committee headed by V. 
Molotov had decided to build a 'Palace of the Soviets' beside the Moscow 
River. Five months later, the Saviour's Temple was dynamited. In 1933 
Stalin commissioned a design by Yofon and Shchusev which envisaged an 
edifice 415 metres high, and six times more capacious than the Empire State 
Building. It was to be surmounted by a figure of Lenin three times taller than 
the Statue of Liberty, with an index finger 6 metres long. 

The Palace was never built. The marble slabs from the demolished 
temple were used to decorate Moscow subway stations. After thirty years' 
delay, Nikita Khrushchev decreed that the hole by the river be turned into an 
open-air, all-weather swimming pool. 1 Inevitably, after the fall of 
Communism, plans reappeared to redevelop the site once again, and to 
restore the Saviour's temple to its former glory. 





Wednesday, 20 April 1814, Fontainebleau. Napoleon Bonaparte, King of Elba, 
was bidding farewell to the Imperial Guard before leaving France for his new 
kingdom. In the lobby of the chateau he greeted the members of his remaining 
entourage, and the gaggle of Allied commissioners. From there he passed to the 
doorway at the head of the Horseshoe Staircase, whose marble balcony 
overlooked the spacious Courtyard of the White Horse. Some 5,000 troops of the 
Old Guard were drawn up. The senior officers stood at the front in a semicircle 
with the colour party and the orchestra. The carriages for his journey were 
waiting by the gate. As he appeared on the parapet, cavalry trumpeters sounded 
the Fanfare de l 'Empereur: 



4r_J~r i rctTfccf l'^r I -5 -T i -T 


lit. 


r\ 



The standard which was paraded that day has survived in the Musee de 
l'Armee. It is a square tricolour with vertical stripes of blue, white, and red, 
embroidered in gold. The front border was adorned with the imperial emblems- 
two crowns in the top corners, two circles with the monogram 'N' on the sides, 
two eagles in the bottom corners, a sheaf surrounded by bees in the upper centre. 
The inscription reads: garde iMPeRiALE-L'EMPeREUR napoleon au l er regiment 
des grenadiers & pied. The reverse is covered with the regiment's battle honours: 
Marengo, Ulm, Austerlitz, lena, Eylau, Friedland, Eckmuhl, Essling, Wagram, 
Smolensk, Moskowa, Vienne, Berlin, Madrid, Moscou. The honours of 1813-14 
-at Lutzen, Bautzen, Dresden, Leipzig, Hanau, Champaubert, Montmirail, 
Vauchamps-were still to be added. 

Napoleon's personal entourage had been reduced to under twenty men. It 
included General Drouot, The Sage of the Grand Army', who would one day 
pronounce the Emperor's funeral oration, General Bertrand, who would bring 
back the Emperor's ashes to France, and the Duke of Bassano, his foreign 



minister. The civilian staff included the aides-de-camp Belliard, Bussy, and 
Montesquion; and the Barons Fait and Lorgne d'ldeville and the Chevalier 
Jouanne, members of the secretariat. Among the military staff was Count 
Kossakowski, commander of the maison militaire, Count d'Ornano, commander 
of dragoons, two colonels of the ordnance, Gourgaud and La Place, Col. Atthalin 
of the topographic service, and Col. Vauzovits (Wasowicz), the Polish 
interpreter. The commander of the Old Guard, Marshal Lefebvre-Desnoettes, 
Duke of Danzig, waited on horseback at the head of the cavalrymen who would 
accompany his carriage to Briare. Apart from him, none of the Marshals of the 
Empire was present, nor a single representative of the imperial family. 

















General Petit, heading the colour party, ordered the presentation of arms. The 
drums beat 'Aux Champs'. Napoleon descended the staircase and plunged into 
the midst of the assembled troops. The Emperor's exact words were not 
recorded, but General Petit was well placed to remember: 


Officiers, sous-officiers, soldiers of my Old Guard! I am bidding you farewell. For twenty years, I have 
been pleased with you. I have found you always on the path of glory. 

The Allied Powers have armed the whole of Europe against me. Part of the Army has betrayed its 
duties and France itself... With you and with other brave men, who have remained faithful, I could have 
carried on the war for another three years. But that would have made France miserable, and would be 
contrary to my declared aims. So, be faithful to the new sovereign which France has chosen. Do not 
abandon this dear Patrie, so long unhappy. 

Do not regret my fate. I shall always be content if I know that you are 
content also. I could have died... But, no. I chose the honourable way. I shall 
write of everything that we have done.- 

At this point General Petit raised his sword and shouted 'Vive l'Empereur', to a 
thunderous echo. 


I cannot embrace you all, so I shall embrace your general. Approchez, General Petit... 


Having enveloped the general, he then said, 'Bring me the Eagle'. He kissed the 
hem of the standard three times with the words, 'Dear Eagle, may these kisses 
reverberate in the heart of all the brave.' Finally: 'Adieu, mes enfants.' 'Those 
grizzled warriors, who many a time had watched unmoved while their own 
blood ran, could not hold back their tears.'- Napoleon strode to the carriage, 
took his seat briskly, and was driven off. 

The Chateau of Fontainebleau, 37 miles to the south-east of Paris, was 
Napoleon's favourite residence. Built by Francis I round the tower of a medieval 
hunting-lodge, it dated from 1528 and represented one of the earliest breaths of 
the Renaissance in France. Surrounded by the oaks and pines of its dense forest, 
it offered true escape and relaxation. Less forbidding than Versailles, it was free 
of the shades of anyone else's glory. Its buildings were arranged round a series of 
courtyards-la Cour Ovale, la Cour des Princes, la Cour de la Fontaine, la Cour 
des Offices, le Jardin de Diane. La Cour du Cheval Blanc, which has been 
known since the events of April 1814 as 'La Cour des Adieux', was realized 
under Louis XIII. The interior, which contained artistic treasures such as Rosso's 
frescos in the Galerie Francois I er , was designed with a touch of splendour, but 


not on a gigantic scale. The decorations and fittings, mainly of the sixteenth and 
seventeenth centuries, had been supplemented by Napoleon's own collection of 
Empire furniture. The chateau had been used as a gilded cage for Pope Pius VII, 
but had also seen the happiest days of Napoleon and Josephine. The Foret de 
Fontainebleau is my English garden', he once said; T want no other.'- To leave 
it was no small wrench. 

The Imperial Guard embodied the essence of two military terms -corps d'elite 
and esprit de corps. Formed in November 1798 as the Consular Guard, it was 
steadily expanded until it became an army within the army. In 1805 it numbered 
some 5,000 men from all four arms-infantry, cavalry, artillery, engineers. In 
1809 it was split into the Old Guard, an elite of veterans within the elite, and the 
Young Guard, drawing on recruits and transferees. By 1813, at its height, it 
possessed nearly 60 different regiments, almost 50,000 men. 

The Guard accepted only the finest applicants. They had to be 1.78 m (5 ft 
10 in) tall, 25 years old, literate, and had to have fought in three campaigns: 
They were given resplendent uniforms, generous pay, special training, and top 
commanders with direct access to the Emperor. They had the right to be 
addressed as 'Monsieur' by all other soldiers. Every week when possible, their 
Tondu -the 'shorn one'-would inspect his moustaches and his grognards, his 
'invincibles' and 'immortals'. In due course the core of veterans, 'the oldest of 
the Old', had served 17, 20, or even 22 years. Joking with the Emperor was 
accepted form. One trooper once called out to ask why he had not yet received 
the Legion d'Honneur. 'Why so?' 'Because I gave you a melon in the Egyptian 
desert!' 'A melon, non, non ...' 'Yes, a melon, and eleven campaigns and seven 
wounds-at Areola, Lodi, Castiglioni, the Pyramids, Acre, Austerlitz, 
Friedland...'. Before he had finished, he was a chevalier of the Empire with a 
payment of 1,200 francs. The Guard included many exotic foreigners. Two of the 
four regiments of 'grognards' were Dutchmen. There were whole 'Velite' 
formations of Italians. The cavalry included a regiment of scimitar-wielding 
Mamelukes, the German 'Landers de Berg', the Tartar Horse from Lithuania, 
and the three regiments of Polish Lancers, the 'truest of the true'. 

For many years Napoleon had been notoriously reluctant to sacrifice his 
guardsmen in battle, except for lightning strikes at critical points. At Borodino 
he had held them back with the words: 'I will not have the Guard destroyed 300 
leagues from Paris!' But then, in the later campaigns, as the supply of trained 


men dwindled amidst the floods of raw recruits, he spared them nothing. In the 
brilliant fighting retreat of 1814, they had marched and bled every step of the 
way.- 


Napoleon had reached Fontainebleau three weeks before, still confident of 
defeating the allied armies. From his defensive position in Champagne, he had 
planned to turn in his tracks and to strike deep into the enemy's lines of 
communication. But marauding Cossacks had captured one of his couriers, and 
had discovered his intention of 'drawing the enemy from Paris'.- In the last 
week of March, therefore, he found that the Russians, Prussians, and Austrians, 
instead of advancing to fight him, had made a sudden concerted lunge against 
the weakly defended capital. The Russians advanced on Romainville. The 
Prussians set up batteries on Montmartre. The Austrians advanced up the Seine 
to Charenton. Two-hundred-thousand allied troops surrounded the capital's 
defensive lines. The defenders under Marshal Marmont, Duke of Ragusa, stood 
their ground. The gallant Duroc, who had lost a leg in Russia, refused to 
surrender: 'I'll give up my positions when you give me back my leg.' But the 
politicians had little stomach for a siege. The citizens feared to share the fate of 
Moscow. Talleyrand had put out feelers to the Tsar. Napoleon's brother Joseph 
left the city with the Empress on the 30th. 

Racing back from St Dizier in his flying barouche, Napoleon covered the 
120 miles in a single day. As on his lightning sleigh ride from Moscow two years 
before, he was accompanied by his Foreign Minister, the loyal Caulaincourt. At 
11 p.m. on the 31st, he was changing horses at the Cour de France inn at Juvisy- 
sur-Orge, only eight miles from Notre Dame, when he met a French officer and 
heard that Paris had capitulated. The news was premature. The Emperor set off 
on foot in the direction of Paris; but then, meeting more men in retreat, he saw 
that he was too late to intervene. He withdrew to Fontainebleau to regroup, 
arriving exhausted at 6 a.m. Three days later, on 3 April, Palm Sunday, he 
reviewed the Guard at Fontainebleau. 10,000 infantrymen and 4,600 sabres 
heard him say, 'In a few days I shall march on Paris. Am I right?' They roared in 
approval. 'A Paris! Vive l'Empereur.' 

However, the reeling Emperor was soon forced to abandon all active plans. 
The first blow was to learn that the Imperial Senate had approved a provisional 
government without him, and was proposing to restore the Bourbons. Then he 
learned that Marmont's corps had defected, thereby rendering further resistance 


almost impossible. The French language received a new verb- raguser, to 
betray. The third blow was to hear from his marshals that they advised 
abdication in favour of his infant son. Marshal Macdonald had told him that to 
draw the sword against fellow-Frenchmen was unthinkable. Marshal Ney 
announced: 'The Army will not march. The Army will obey its chiefs.'- The 
'bravest of the brave' had lost the will to fight. Finally, the Emperor found that 
the Allies would no longer accept the terms of his first abdication, effected on 4 
April. For a terrible week he writhed under the growing realization that exile 
alone would suffice. The degringoladey the 'disintegration', was complete. 

The bitterest cup was handed him by his wife, Marie-Louise. Ignoring his 
tender and courageous letters, the Empress repaid all his earlier neglect and 
disloyalties with interest. She responded with indecision, and then with callous 
disregard. The initial assumption was that she would join him either at 
Fontainebleau, or perhaps at some stage on their road to a shared exile. Then it 
was agreed that she should travel to meet her father, the Emperor Francis, to 
plead her husband's cause. It emerged that she had no such intentions. She was 
going to Vienna, but to break with her husband for ever. 

The Army had to be released from its oath of allegiance. The formula chosen 
by Marshal Augerau was specially wounding. 'Soldiers,' he declared, 'you are 
released from your oaths by the abdication of a man who, after sacrificing 
millions of victims to his cruel ambition, did not have the courage to die the 
death of a soldier.'- The tricolour was replaced by the white cockade. 

The one fixed point in all these shifting sands lay with the Imperial Guard. 
On the night after the first abdication, they massed in the streets of 
Fontainebleau, torches in hand, to cries of'Vive l'Empereur.' He had to order 
them to barracks. He also received a heart-warming letter from Count Wincenty 
Krasinski, the senior general of the Polish contingent. 'The marshals are 
deserting. The politicians betray you ... But your Poles remain ...'- But even 
the Polish regiments were divided. One-third of the chevau-legers-lanciers 
stayed on. But another third, mainly Frenchmen, broke up. The remaining 1,384 
set off for Poland, led by the hero of Somosierra. Resplendent and perfumed on 
his black Arab charger, Kozietulski took leave of the emperor for the last time: 

Sire, We lay at Your Imperial Majesty's feet the arms which no man could take from us by force ... We 
have served as Poles the most amazing man of the century... Accept, Sire, the homage of our eternal 
loyalty... to an unfortunate prince.- 

The politicking in Paris was led by Talleyrand, Chairman of the Senate, who 


emerged as the President of the Provisional Government. Talleyrand was behind 
the anonymous signals that had urged the Allied armies to attack; and he was 
now entertaining the Tsar in his own house. Royalist emigres were streaming 
back, and the stock of the Bourbons was rising daily. The Comte de Provence 
(Louis XVIII), now 59 years old, was returning home. He had spent twenty-three 
years in exile, at Coblenz, Verona, Blankenberg, Calmar, Mittau in Courland, 
Warsaw, and the last five years in England. He was packing his bags at Hartwell 
in Buckinghamshire in the same week that Napoleon was packing at 
Fontainebleau. He was determined to underline his hereditary right by rejecting a 
constitution prepared by the Senate, but also to grant a liberal constitutional 
charter of his own making. Dubbed punningly Louis des Huitres, The oyster- 
eater', from his gourmet reputation, he was a man of conciliation who had no 
intention of replacing the entire imperial establishment. Napoleon's marshals and 
ministers awaited the restoration with equanimity. The Russians were camped in 
the Champs Elysees. The Emperor Francis was at Rambouillet, Frederick- 
William of Prussia at The Tuileries. The Parisians went out to see the exotic 
sights-veteran Prussian grenadiers in pigtails, colourful Croats and Hungarians, 
Circassians in chain-mail, mounted Bashkir bowmen. 

As France wrestled with its ex-Emperor, the rest of Europe adjusted to the 
consequences of his fall. News in 1814 travelled slowly. Neither Wellington nor 
Soult were aware that Napoleon had already abdicated when they fought the last 
battle of the Peninsular campaign near Toulouse on 10 April. The imperial 
garrison on Corfu did not know about it until a British frigate called on them to 
surrender in June. Elsewhere, the main pieces of the Napoleonic Empire had 
already fallen apart. In the East, the Duchy of Warsaw had been occupied by the 
Russians for over a year. The Prussian and Austrian monarchies were resurgent. 
The Confederation of the Rhine had dissolved. In Switzerland, the old 
constitution had been revived. In Spain, Ferdinand VII had just been restored. In 
the Netherlands, William of Orange had just returned. In Scandinavia, Norway 
had just rebelled against its transfer from Denmark to Sweden. In Italy, the 
Napoleonic states had been overrun by the Austrians. Pope Pius was on his way 
back to Rome, where he would revive the Index and the Inquisition. 

Britain, immune from the Continental fighting, was basking in the glow of 
the victorious Regency. Nash was rebuilding the Brighton Pavilion in fantastic 
pseudo-oriental style. The Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, said of Napoleon, 
'He will soon be forgotten.' Sir Walter Scott published the first of the Waverley 
novels. George Stephenson was perfecting the first effective steam locomotive at 



Killingworth Colliery near Newcastle. The English language later received from 
Mrs Margaret Sanger the term 'birth control'. The Marylebone Cricket Club 
opened its first season at Lord's. Popular discontent from the post-war recession 
was brewing. The war with the United States had died down, but had not yet 
been terminated. 

In the arts, 1814 was a year when the Classical still vied with the rising 
Romantic. This was the year of E. T. A. Hoffmann's Phantasiestiicke, his 
fantastic 'Tales'. In painting, Goya, Ingres, and Turner were all active. In music, 
the young Schubert wrote The Erlking, Beethoven completed his only opera, 
Fidelio. J. G. Fichte died; Mikhail Lermontov was born. 

France's political crisis came to a head during Holy Week. Allied 
Commissioners arrived at Fontainebleau on 6 April to administer the revised act 
of abdication, which Napoleon duly signed. 

The Allied Powers, having proclaimed that the Emperor Napoleon is the only obstacle to the re¬ 
establishment of peace in Europe, the Emperor Napoleon, faithful to his oath, declares that he renounces for 
himself and his heirs the thrones of France and of Italy, and that there is no personal sacrifice, even of life 
itself, that he is unwilling to make in the interests of France.- 

Further negotiations led to the Treaty of Fontainebleau, concluded on the 11th, 
whereby Napoleon was to retain his title, a pension of 2 million francs, the Isle 
of Elba as his personal realm, and a personal staff and escort. 

The British Commissioner, Sir Neil Campbell, spent many hours talking to 
the stricken Emperor at this time: 

I saw before me a short active-looking man who was rapidly pacing the apartment like some wild animal 
with epaulets, blue pantaloons, and red topboots, unshaven, uncombed, with fallen particles of snuff 
scattered profusely over his upper lip and breast. 

They discussed Wellington's campaigns in the Peninsula. Then the Emperor 
reportedly said, 'Your nation is the greatest of all... I have tried to raise up the 
French nation, but my plans have failed. It is fate.'- 

The ex-Emperor's psychological crisis came to a head when the negotiations 
were completed. He was convinced that he was deserted by his family as well as 
by the marshals. Giving command of the Guard to Marshal Ney, he had been 
assured: 'We are all your friends.' To which he replied bitterly, 'Aye, and 
Caesar's friends were also his murderers!' His messengers to the Empress had 


the greatest difficulty crossing the Allied lines. At Orleans, where the Young 
Guard stood at her side, the imperial paymaster was hiding the remains of the 
Emperor's treasure under a pile of horse manure in the bishop's stables. On the 
nth, Napoleon ate a desultory evening meal with Caulaincourt, who had been 
acting as his go-between with the senators in Paris. He found that his valet had 
emptied the powder from the brace of pistols which he always kept by his bed. 
But he still had a phial of opiate that he had carried ever since his near-capture 
by Cossacks in Russia two years before. He retired to his room, and swallowed 
the contents. The poison had faded. It was strong enough to set him screaming 
from stomach cramps and convulsions, but not to kill him. Caulaincourt brought 
a doctor. The Emperor recovered by the morning. He said 'How difficult it is to 
die in one's bed!' (The secret was concealed until the publication of 
Caulaincourt's private memoirs in 1933.)- 

On the 13th, Napoleon bade farewell to James Macdonald, Duke of Taranto, 
the last of his Marshals to stay by his side. The devoted Scotsman, son of an 
exiled Jacobite family, had joined Coulaincourt in the recent abdication talks 
with the Allied powers. He could not fail to notice that a Campbell had arrived 
as the Macdonald was about to leave. But his task was done. Napoleon presented 
him with the ceremonial sword of Murad Bey, a memento of the campaign in 
Egypt in 1799: 'Receive this in remembrance of me and of my friendship.'- 

Preparations for the journey to Elba began as soon as the Treaty of 
Fontainebleau was signed. The Emperor was to be escorted to the south of 
France by the four Allied commissioners-Colonel Campbell, Count Shuvalov, 
Baron von Roller, and Count Trachsess von Waldburg. They were to travel via 
Lyons and Avignon to a port on the Riviera, where a British frigate would be 
waiting for the five-day passage to Elba. A team of grooms and wagoners were 
hard at work at the depot of Rosnieres in the Forest of Fontainebleau, cleaning 
and greasing the eight carriages of the convoy, painting out the imperial 
armorials, packing stores into the twenty vehicles of the baggage train, preparing 
the 101 saddle and carriage horses that were needed. A hundred wagon-loads of 
the Emperor's furniture and personal effects were to follow later. The heaviest 
items would be sent in advance to Briare, in the south, where they would be 
joined by the Emperor and his escort at the end of the first day. The advance 
party moved off on the morning of the 14th down the Montargis road. 

The selection of the escort was left to the Emperor. He was allowed a staff of 
thirty officers, and a garrison of 600 men. The cavalry detachment was formed 


under General Jerzmanowski from a squadron of Polish lancers into which a 
handful of Frenchmen and Mamelukes were also admitted. There was a crew of 
marines, an artillery battery with 100 gunners, and one infantry battalion made 
up from three companies of grenadiers and three of chasseurs. The men of the 
battalion were to be picked out in person at the final review. 

On the last Saturday, Napoleon tried to settle accounts with the women of his 
Ufe. To Josephine, he wrote: 

In my exile, I will replace the sword with the pen ... They've betrayed me one and all... Adieu, ma bonne 
Josephine. Learn resignation as I have learned it, and never banish from your memory the one who has 
never forgotten you, and will never forget you.- 

To Marie-Louise, his Empress, he used the formal vousr. 

My dear wife, Providence ... has given its verdict against me. I congratulate you 
on the course you have taken ... I hardly think that Destiny will bring us 
together again... Of ah my punishments, my separation from you is the most 
cruel. I make only one reproach. Why not exercise the empire on my heart that 
motherhood conferred on you? You feared me, and you loved me...- 

The letters were not sent. They were found in his desk at Fontainebleau some 
days later, unsigned. 

After that, there was nothing left but to await the day of departure fixed for 
the following Wednesday. Napoleon recovered his spirits. He caused as much 
trouble as possible. He flew once or twice into his customary rages. And he 
spoiled the Commissioners' dinner, by telling his valet to announce his arrival at 
their table and making them stand, then remaining in his room. 

As a soldier, Napoleon had contemplated death and oblivion many times. On 
one occasion he had questioned Marshal Segur about what the people would say 
after he was gone. The minister recited a paean of grief and eulogy. 'Non,' said 
Napoleon, wringing his wrist in the Gallic fashion, 'ils diront "Ouf"' (No, they'll 
just say 'Phew').- 

On the Wednesday morning, Napoleon dressed simply for the farewell 
ceremony. He was the grand master of theatricality, and of timing. He had once 
explained that history was made up of time and space. 'One always has a chance 
of recovering lost ground,' he remarked, 'but lost time-never.' He must have 
savoured the chance to stage what historians were to dub the 'Last Supper' of 


Napoleonic iconography. According to conflicting accounts, he either wore the 
undress uniform of the Chasseurs de la Garde,-a cut-away tunic in green over 
white waistcoat and breeches,-or a blue tunic with blue pantaloons. At all 
events, he wore thigh-length boots, a dress sword at his side, on his breast the 
single star of the Legion, and on his head the legendary black hat with upturned 
brim at the rear. At 11 a.m. exactly, or by other accounts on the stroke of i 
o'clock, he made for the lobby and stepped out onto the head of the marble 
staircase. 

There are many moments in history when it appears that an era has finished, that 
some long-established regime or system has finally passed away. These are 
dangerous moments for all concerned, not least for historians who wish to cut 
their subject into tidy periods. For regimes and societies and economies rarely 
die overnight as individuals do. Even in times of apparently cataclysmic 
collapse, the forces of continuity and inertia will always contend with the motors 
of change. Napoleon was not dead. He had not yet passed into legend. He had 
bid his Guard 'Adieu', but not for the last time.

DYNAMO 

Powerhouse of the World, 1815-1914 


There is a dynamism about nineteenth-century Europe that far exceeds anything 
previously known. Europe vibrated with power as never before: with technical 
power, economic power, cultural power, intercontinental power. Its prime 
symbols were its engines-the locomotives, the gasworks, the electric dynamos. 
Raw power appeared to be made a virtue in itself, whether in popular views of 
evolution, which preached 'the survival of the fittest', in the philosophy of 
historical materialism, which preached the triumph of the strongest class, in the 
cult of the Superman, or in the theory and practice of imperialism. 

Europeans, in fact, were made to feel not only powerful but superior. They 
were infinitely impressed by the unaccustomed 'forces' which surrounded them. 
They saw new physical forces, from the electric current to dynamite; new 
demographic forces which accompanied an unprecedented growth of population; 
new social forces which brought 'the masses' to the forefront of public concern; 
new commercial and industrial forces that thrived on the unparalleled expansion 
of markets and technology, new military forces that could mobilize millions of 
men and machines; new cultural forces which spawned 'movements' of mass 
appeal; new political forces which won unchallenged supremacy throughout the 
world. 

Here, indeed, was Europe's triumphant 'power century'. Its leaders were in 
the first instance Great Britain, 'the workshop of the world', and in the later 










decades Germany, whose failure to find 'a place in the sun' helped reduce the 
whole edifice to ruins. Its losers and victims consisted of all the people and 
peoples who could not adapt, or could not compete-the peasants, the hand- 
weavers, the urban poor; the colonial peoples; the Irish, the Sicilians, and the 
Poles, who were forced to migrate in their millions; the three great empires of 
the East-Turkey, Austria-Hungary, Russia. The century began in the aftermath 
of one revolution, in France, and ended in the prelude to another revolution, in 
Russia. It began with one would-be master of all-Europe, Napoleon, proclaiming 
that Power was his mistress. It ended with another, Lenin, proclaiming: 
'Communism is Soviet Power plus the Electrification of the whole country.' 

It can be argued, of course, that the nineteenth century's experience of power 
was less than that of the twentieth century. After all, the potency of steam and 
electricity bears no comparison to that of nuclear fission. The marvellous speed 
of a railway train cannot compete with that of aeroplanes or intercontinental 
rockets. The oppressive capacity of imperialism and colonialism, great though it 
was, can hardly be likened to the totalitarian tyranny of fascism and 
communism. The point is that, for nineteenth-century man, power was the object 
of wonder and hope; for twentieth-century man, it became the object of 
suspicion. In the interval which separates the Industrial Revolution from 
Environmental-ism, attitudes have been transformed. The benefits of electricity, 
when discovered in 1805, were not doubted; the benefits of nuclear power 
provoke anguished debates. Industrialization or colonialism were once seen as a 
great step foward for all concerned. They are now seen, at best, to have brought 
mixed blessings. 

The psychology of power and speed has been changed out of all recognition. 
In 1830, when the world's first passenger train ran between Liverpool and 
Manchester, a senior British politician was knocked down and killed by the 
Rocket, which was travelling at 24 m.p.h.; despite ample warning, he had failed 
to comprehend the implications. In 1898, when motor vehicles were first 
allowed on to public roads in Britain, they were restricted to 4 m.p.h., so that a 
man might walk ahead with a red flag. Nowadays, no concern is shown by 
millions who cruise at 100 m.p.h. on the German autobahns, at 240 m.p.h. on the 
French TGV, or at 1,000 m.p.h. on Concorde. Since the nineteenth century 
power and speed have been made familiar; and familiarity has bred contempt. 

Naturally, most Europeans did not realize how great was the power which 
had been put in their hands. The rash and the ambitious sought to exploit it to the 



full; the wise sought to use it with caution. The British, the early leaders, had 
little choice but to step warily in Continental affairs. So too did Otto von 
Bismarck, creator of the most powerful industrial and military unit of the age. 
The Iron Chancellor turned Germany into a great power, but not a universal 
menace. His best-known phrases about 'iron and blood' (1849) or 'blood and 
iron' (1886) were spoken about budgets and social affairs, not war. As the 
century's greatest statesman, he even grasped the limitations of statesmanship 
itself, not aspiring 'to control the current of events, only occasionally to deflect 
it'. 'In der Beschrankung zeigt sich erst der Meister', ran one of Goethe's 
epigrams (The master triumphs by holding back, or Genius consists of knowing 
when to stop).- Bismarck's successors did not practise such restraint. 

Contrary to some expectations, Europe's brush with modern power revived 
its Christian culture. The 'Railway Age' was also the age of muscular 
Christianity. Engineers went out into the world in the company of missionaries. 
People who felt their own vulnerability in a fast-changing world hankered after 
earlier models of piety and discipline. Despite the mindless machines, and in line 
with the growing wave of Romanticism, they felt more need for divine 
reassurance, a greater readiness to accept the supernatural, an eagerness to 
experience 'the depth of their being'. When they died, they were not averse to 
seeing their life as a journey on the 'Spiritual Railway': 

The Line to Heaven by Christ was made 
With heavenly truth the rails were laid, 

From Earth to Heaven the Line extends, 

To Life Eternal where it ends... 

God's Love the Fire, his Truth the Steam 
Which drives the Engine and the Train. 

All you who would to Glory ride 
Must come to Christ, in Him abide 
In First and Second, and Third Class 
Repentance, Faith, and Holiness... 

Come then, poor Sinners, now's the Time 
At any station on the Line, 

If you'll repent and turn from sin, 

The train will stop and take you in? 


The initial circumstances of nineteenth-century Europe were crucial. The forces 


for change could only operate within the political and international framework 
that came into being at the end of the revolutionary wars. And that framework 
was given a very particular twist by the extraordinary events of 1815. 

In February of that year, at the moment when the Congress of Vienna was 
failing to agree on a settlement, the revolutionary genie slipped once more from 
the bottle. Napoleon escaped from Elba. In the subsequent 'Hundred Days', 
Europe had to face the spectre of revolutionary war all over again. The shock 
was tremendous. If the political mood among the victorious powers in 1814 had 
been cautious, in 1815 it became downright reactionary. It created a climate in 
the subsequent decades where any sign of changes was instantly suppressed. 

The Cent Jours, therefore, electrified Europe. Within three weeks of his 
lonely landing at Antibes on 1 March, Napoleon had crossed the Dauphine Alps, 
won over Marshal Ney, who had been sent to 'bring him back in a cage', and 
entered Paris in triumph, forcing Louis XVIII to flee. Within three months he 
had reformed his army and left Paris to attack the forces of the Coalition which 
were gathering on the northern frontier. His strategy was simple-to pick off the 
Allies one by one before they could coalesce against him. On 16 June, at Ligny, 
he defeated the Prussians, but did not prevent them from retiring in good order. 
On 18 June he confidently attacked the British at Waterloo near Brussels. But the 
'thin red line' of the Duke of Wellington resisted all the furious charges of the 
French in a day of unrelenting slaughter; and Bliicher's Prussian cavalry, riding 
over the horizon in the late afternoon, swept the French from the field. 
Napoleon, after his sixtieth set battle, was finally swept from the field of history. 
On 22 June he abdicated yet again; on 15 July, a fugitive at Rochefort, he 
surrendered to Capt. Maitland of HMS Bellerophon. He was taken to Plymouth, 
and thence to the remote island of St Helena. This time he didn't escape. Writing 
his memoirs, he predicted that within ten years Europe would be either 'Cossack 
or republican'. When he died, 'it was not an event', Talleyrand said, 'only a 
news item', [eco] 

Reconvening after Waterloo, the Congress of Vienna met in chastened mood. 
The representatives of the victorious powers could not be accused, as in the 
previous year, of'dancing instead of making progress'. They were ready to risk 
nothing. They were determined, above all, to restore the rights of monarchy-the 
sacred institution considered most threatened by the Revolution. In so doing, 
they paid little attention to the claims either of democracy or of nationality. They 
resolved their differences by compensating the disgruntled at the expense of the 



defeated. A German Confederation of 39 states was to take the place of the 
Confederation of the Rhine and the Holy Roman Empire (see Appendix III, p. 
1299). Prussia, which had been pressing for Alsace, Lorraine, and Warsaw, was 
given half of Saxony instead. Austria, which had lost its stake in the 
Netherlands, was given much of northern Italy. The United Provinces, which had 
lost the Cape of Good Hope, was given the Austrian Netherlands. Sweden, 
which had lost Finland, was given Norway. Russia was confirmed in its 
possession of Finland, Lithuania, and eastern Poland, and was given a separate 
kingdom of Poland round Warsaw, where the Tsar could be king. Britain 
contented itself with a bag of islands from Heligoland to Ceylon. A gaggle of 
antiquated monarchies was restored to Naples, Madrid, and Turin-but few of 
the old republics were allowed to revive. As Tsar Alexander remarked, 
'Republics are not in fashion'. An exception was made for the Republic of 
Cracow, a city claimed by Prussia, Russia, and Austria and withheld from all of 
them. 

The spirit of the settlement, therefore, was more than conservative: it 
actually put the clock back. It was designed to prevent change in a world where 
the forces of change had only been contained by a whisker. The Duke of 
Wellington's comment on Waterloo was: 'a damned nice thing, the nearest run 
thing you ever saw in your life'. Such was the feeling all over Europe. The issue 
between change and no change was so close that the victors felt terrified of the 
least concession. Even limited, gradual reform was viewed with suspicion. 
'Beginning reform', wrote the Duke in 1830, 'is beginning revolution.' What is 
more, France, the eternal source of revolutionary disturbances, had not been 
tamed. Paris was to erupt repeatedly-in 1830, 1848, 1851, 1870. 'When Paris 
sneezes,' commented the Austrian Chancellor, Metternich, 'Europe catches 
cold.' French-style democracy was a menace threatening monarch, Church, and 
property-the pillars of everything he stood for. It was, he said, 'the disease 
which must be cured, the volcano which must be extinguished, the gangrene 
which must be burned out with a hot iron, the hydra with jaws open to swallow 
up the social order'. 2 

In its extreme form, as embodied by Metternich, the reactionary spirit of 
1815 was opposed to any sort of change which did not obtain prior approval. It 
found expression in the first instance in the Quadruple Alliance of Russia, 
Prussia, Austria, and Britain, who agreed to organize future congresses whenever 
need arose, and then in a wider 'Holy Alliance' organized by the Tsar. The 
former produced the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818), which readmitted 


France to the concert of respectable nations. The latter produced the proposal 
that the powers should guarantee existing frontiers and governments in 
perpetuity. 

All this was too much for the British government, which in advising the 
Prince Regent against the Holy Alliance had put him into the company of the 
Sultan and the Pope. By British standards, Lord Liverpool's government was 
unusually conservative: in its internal policies it was resisting reform on all 
fronts. But it could not allow the reactionaries of Europe to create the 
international equivalent of a steam-engine with no form of safety-valve. At each 
of the subsequent Congresses held at Troppau (1820), Laibach (1821), and 
Verona (1822), the British held strong reservations about the successive 
expeditions for crushing revolution in Naples, Greece, and Spain. On the critical 
issue of the revolt of Spain's South American colonies, the British Foreign 
Secretary, George Canning, joined the US President, James Monroe, in 
forbidding any sort of European intervention in the Americas. 'I called the New 
World into existence', he told the House of Commons in 1826, 'to redress the 
Balance of the Old.' In effect, he killed the Congress System stone dead. 'Things 
are getting back to a wholesome state,' he remarked shortly before his death. 
'Every nation for itself, and God for us all.' 

None the less, the short-lived 'Congress System' was important for setting 
the scene within which nineteenth-century Europe began its stormy career. 
Despite its failure to create any durable institutions-which had briefly promised 
to assume the mantle of some premature League of Nations-it set the climate of 
the conservative Continental order against which all subsequent reformers and 
revolutionaries had to contend. It delineated the international arena in which the 
five recognized powers-the Quadruple Alliance plus a reinstated France-were 
to operate against all upstarts and newcomers for the next century. Despite 
important modifications, it presided over a map of Europe that was not to change 
in its essentials until 1914-18. 

From the starting-point of 1815 the century evolved through three clear 
stages, those of reaction (1815-48), reform (1848-71), and rivalry (1871-1914). 
In the first stage, the conservative fortress held out with varying success until it 
collapsed amidst the general revolutionary outburst of 1848. In the second stage, 
the powers reluctantly conceded that controlled reform was preferable to endless 
resistance. Important concessions were made on all fronts. Constitutions were 
granted, the last serfs emancipated. Two of the three leading contenders for 



national independence were allowed to achieve it. In the third and final stage, 
Europe entered a period of intense rivalry, aggravated by diplomatic 
realignments, military rearmament, and colonial competition. Forty years of 
unequalled peace could not restrain the growing tensions which in August 1914 
were permitted to pass into open conflict. Europe's modern and modernizing 
societies, armed with modern weapons, recklessly entered a modern war whose 
slaughter made Napoleon's battles look like skirmishes.

'Modernization', not to be confused with Modernism,* is now the preferred 
sociological term to describe the complex series of transformations which 
communities undergo on their way from 'backwardness' to 'modernity'. Its 
starting-point is the traditional type of agrarian, peasant-based society, where the 
majority of people work on the land and produce their own food; and its 
destination is the modern type of urbanized and industrialized society, where 
most people earn their living in towns and factories. It consists of a chain of 
some 30 or 40 related changes, each link of which forms a necessary component 
in the total operation. It certainly includes and subsumes industrialization and 
'the Industrial Revolution', which is now usually taken to be just one vital part, 
or one stage, of the overall process. 'No change in human life since the invention 
of agriculture, metallurgy, and towns in the New Stone Age has been so 
profound as the coming of industrialisation. '- 

By general consent, modernization was first experienced in Great Britain- 
or rather in certain regions of Great Britain such as Lancashire, Yorkshire, the 
Black Country, Tyneside, Clydebank, and South Wales. But it was soon felt on 
the Continent, especially in locations on or near the great coalfields in Belgium, 
in the Ruhr, and in Silesia. From these areas of industrial concentration its 
effects were gradually felt in ever-widening circles, first in the ports, then in the 
capital cities, and eventually right across the countries which received the 
industrial stimulus. It could never be complete; but to varying degrees its effects 
were felt across the face of Europe. When they were felt overseas, either through 
the colonial end of imperial economies or through local initiative, they were seen 
as aspects of 'Europeanization'. In this way, modernization became the focal 
point not only of a world-wide economic system but equally of the distinction 
between 'developed' and 'developing' countries. 




Modernization, above all, must be seen as a motor of change, not as the static 
sum of its component parts. This motor, or engine, needs first to ignite, then to 
accelerate, and finally to reach the critical point of 'take-off', when it passes into 
an entirely different mode of motion. (It can best be likened to the twentieth- 
century phenomenon of flying, although the example of the early nineteenth- 
century locomotive is perhaps more fitting.) There is the long period of 
preparation, when the boiler is lit and a sufficient head of steam accumulated; 
there is the dramatic moment of departure, when steam pressure is applied to the 
pistons and the wheels begin to move; there is the phase of consolidation, as the 
engine picks up speed amidst an array of groans and judders; and there is the 
glorious state of cruising, when it purrs sweetly along the track with maximum 
speed and efficiency. 

Throughout the nineteenth century, most European governments were 
striving to foster the conditions that would take their countries from economic 
ignition to social 'take-off'. Some succeeded; some did not; some had no chance 
of success in the first place. After Britain's lonely start, most of the countries of 
northwestern Europe followed suit in the middle of the century-first Belgium 
and Holland, then Prussia, Piedmont, and France. By the end of the century 
Britain's lead was being rapidly overhauled by the superior resources and 
dynamism of a united Germany. 

Most countries showed marked contrasts between modernized metropolitan 
regions and their outlying provinces. Within the United Kingdom, England 
began to look very different from the outlying highlands and islands. Highly 
developed regions began to appear along the Paris-Lyons-Marseilles axis in 
France; along the Lille-Liege-Rotterdam axis in the Low Countries; along the 
Rhineland-Ruhr-Berlin-Saxony-Silesia axis in Germany; in the Bohemia- 
Vienna-Budapest core of Austria-Hungary; in Lombardy within the united Italy. 
Provinces such as Ireland, Brittany, Galicia, or Sicily were highly 
underdeveloped. The Russian Empire, despite regional contrasts of the most 
extreme degree, was accelerating rapidly towards modernization in the last years 
before 1914. 

Owing to differential developments both between states and within states, the 
existing economic contrasts within Europe were greatly accentuated. Indeed, in 
the course of the nineteenth century, two distinct economic zones emerged: an 
advanced, predominantly industrialized and modernized zone in the North and 
West, and a backward, industrializing but largely unmodernized zone in the 



South and East. The former participated in the 'worldwide maritime economy', 
still dominated by Great Britain, and like Britain was able to boost its 
performance by the acquisition of overseas colonies. The latter could only act as 
a dependent source of food, raw materials, and cheap migrant labour, and as a 
captive market for manufactured goods. 

The one major discrepancy lay with Germany, which, though it became the 
most dynamic country of the industrialized zone, was prevented for reasons of 
politics and timing from acquiring a commensurate collection of colonies. As a 
result, once Germany was united in 1871, it forged close economic links with the 
countries of Eastern Europe, thereby compensating itself for its colonial failures. 
Whereas in former times the divide between Western and Eastern Europe had 
largely been religious and political in nature, it now assumed strong economic 
overtones. 

Industrialization in Eastern Europe was confined to localized areas which 
stood out like islands in a sea of rural backwardness. Such islands grew up in 
northern Bohemia, in the triangle of Lodz-War saw-Dqbrowa, in the cotton mills 
of Nizhny Novgorod and St Petersburg, in the Donbass, and in the oilfields of 
Galicia, Romania, and the Caspian. What is more, these islands were not just 
geographically isolated: even at the end of the century, they generated 
insufficient momentum for driving the economy as a whole to the point of take¬ 
off. The consequences, both social and strategic, were considerable. The mass of 
the peasant population suffered mounting distress; they were freed from former 
obligations on the land but were given no adequate opportunity for betterment in 
the towns. They could benefit neither from modern agriculture nor from any 
significant degree of industrial employment. What is more, in a poor society, the 
state had to tax its poverty-stricken subjects mercilessly. Here were the makings 
of social and political revolt. Seeing this, and fearing the dynamism of Germany, 
the Western Powers decided to bolster their political rapprochement with Russia 
with a campaign for massive investment. In 1890-1914 French, British, and 
Belgian investment in Russia mounted mightily, fuelling a massive increase in 
Russia's railway mileage, industrial production, and foreign trade. 

The question remains whether an all-European economy existed or not. The 
answer is probably not. But if it did-and those massive Western investments in 
Russia heralded growing economic integration-then the pivotal position clearly 
came to be occupied by Germany. By 1900 Germany combined a major stake in 
the industry and commerce of the West with a dominant role in the economics of 



the East. 

Given the contrast between Germany's economic precocity and her political 
retardation, it is not surprising that modernization's leading theorists were both 
Germans. Yet Friedrich List (1789-1846), whose National System of Political 
Economy was published in 1841, derived very different conclusions from those 
of Karl Marx (see pp. 837-8). For Marx, the motor of change was to be found in 
the class struggle; for List, it was to be found in the economic policy of the state, 
which could foster development by protectionist tariffs and by heavy investment 
in infrastructure and education. List was the most coherent advocate of what 
others have called the 'Prussian road to capitalism'-an example which excited 
the imagination of many, especially in Eastern Europe, who longed to follow in 
Prussia's steps.- 

At the time few Europeans bothered to ask the fundamental question why 
this modernization occurred in Europe rather than elsewhere. The answer would 
seem to lie in a particular coincidence of ecological, economic, social, cultural, 
and political circumstances, which other more ancient and highly sophisticated 
civilizations did not possess. The emphasis lies on coincidence-in other words, 
on 'the European miracle'. - 

Seen in detail, the process of modernization can be broken down into an 
apparently endless chain of sub-processes and new developments, each 
interacting with the others. Apart from the dozen factors which contributed to 
the initial Industrial Revolution, some thirty others have to be taken into account 
as change fuelled change in the economic, social, cultural, psychological, 
political, and military spheres. (See Appendix III, p. 1293.) 

Agricultural production benefited from the gradual introduction of machines, 
from McCormick's horse-drawn reapers (1832) to steam-driven threshers, and 
eventually to petrol-driven tractors (1905). The export of agricultural machinery 
was a major item in the trade between industrial and non-industrial regions. 
More machines meant fewer hands on the farm, and more people who could 
migrate to town and factory. 

The mobility of labour was greatly increased during the Revolutionary wars, 
when serfdom was abolished in France, Italy, and Spain, and when millions of 
soldiers left their villages never to return. In Eastern Europe the emancipation of 
the serfs took place over several later decades. It caused much misery in Prussia 
in 1811-48, where brutal rentification of services often led to forcible 


clearances. It happened overnight in Austria in 1848, leaving a trail of 
unresolved disputes. It was effected in the Russian Empire by the ukaz of 1861, 
in the Kingdom of Poland by the ukaz of April 1864. 

New sources of power were brought in to supplement 'King Coal', first with 
gas, then with oil, and later with the commercial use of electricity. Pall Mall in 
London had been illuminated by gas lights in 1813; and coal-gas was generally 
available in Britain for domestic and urban use from the 1820s. Oil was available 
from the 1860s. Oilfields were opened up in Europe at Borystaw (Galicia), at 
Ploesti (Romania), and at Baku on the Caspian. With time, the internal 
combustion engine (1889) was to prove as revolutionary as the steam engine. 
Electricity became widely available only in the 1880s, following Gramme's 
perfection of the dynamo (1869) and the construction by Deprez of high-tension 
transmission cables (1881). It could produce heat, light, and traction. The debut 
of'la Fee Elec-tricite' took place at the Universal Exhibition in Paris in 1900. At 
that time, 92 per cent of the world's energy still came from coal. 

Power-driven machines and engines were applied to an ever-widening range 
of operations, from conveyor belts to steamboats. The critical developments, 
however, were those of machine tools-machines that manufactured machines- 
and of power tools, such as the steam-hammer or pile-driver, which eliminated 
the manual element from heavy operations. Henry Maudslay (1771-1831) of 
Woolwich, inventor of the metal lathe (1797), is sometimes seen as the father of 
the field. 

Mining, for all the advances in pumping and safety, remained a labour- 
intensive industry. In 1900 as in 1800, millions of European coalminers 
crouched at the coalface, pick in hand, selling their health for a high wage and 
silicosis. Iron-mining was centred on the rich 'Minette' deposits in Luxemburg- 
Lorraine, in northern Spain, in northern Sweden, and at Krivoi Rog in Ukraine. 
Metallurgy made greater progress. A series of advances in blast-furnace design 
culminated in Sir Henry Bessemer's Converter at Sheffield (1856) and in 
Martin's open-hearth process at Sireuil (1864). The Railway Age was supplied 
with cheap, high-quality steel which, apart from rails, could be used for bridges, 
ships, building frames, munitions. In the 1880s advances in the theory and 
practice of allotropy brought a wide range of high-grade alloys on to the 
markets, with specialized uses in tool-making and artillery. Electro-metallurgy 
facilitated aluminium production. If the eighteenth-century ironmasters were the 
princes of the first Industrial Revolution, the steelmakers of the late nineteenth 



century, such as Schneider of Le Creusot or Krupp of Essen, were their true heirs 
apparent. Steel production became the key index of industrial power. (See 
Appendix III, pp. 1296-7). 

Transport improved dramatically in speed, efficiency, and comfort. Roads 
entered a new era with John McAdam's stone and tar surface (1815), only fully 
utilized after the arrival of the motor car. Bridging acquired fresh dimensions 
with Telford's first suspension bridge at the Menai Straits (1819). Railways 
carried ever more passengers and freight ever more cheaply and faster. Overland 
travel time between Paris and St Petersburg was cut from 20 days in 1800 to 30 
hours in 1900. Europeans were united by the romance and the utility of their 
railways. By the turn of the century, by far the densest network had been built in 
Belgium (42.8 km of track per 100 km 2 as compared to 19 km in the UK and 
17.2 km in Germany). By far the most extensive provision had been made in 
Sweden (27 km per 10,000 inhabitants as against 12.2 km in Belgium). By far 
the worst provision had been made in Serbia (2.5 km per 10,000 as compared 
with 5.7 km in European Russia), [benz] 

In aviation, the Montgolfiers' hot-air balloon, first tested on 5 June 1783 at 
Annonay near Lyons, made ballooning an important military skill throughout the 
nineteenth century. It was superseded by Count Zeppelin's dirigible airship 
(1900) and shortly afterwards by aeroplanes. In the 1890s Otto Lilienthal 
pioneered gliding in Germany, and in 1903 at Dayton (Ohio) the Wright Brothers 
achieved manned, petrol-driven flight. On 25 July 1909 Louis Bleriot 
sensationally flew a monoplane across the English Channel in 31 minutes. 

Communication systems improved in parallel. The creation of unified postal 
services made rapid correspondence available to all. Postage stamps made their 
appearance with Great Britain's 'Penny Black' on 1 May 1840. They were 
introduced in Zurich and Geneva (1843), in France and Bavaria (1849), in 
Prussia, Austria, and Spain (1850), in Sweden (1855), in Russia and Romania 
(1858), in Poland (i860), in Iceland (1873). The invention of the electric 
telegraph (1835), of the telephone (1877), and of radio (1896) rendered long¬ 
distance communication instantaneous. The most famous demonstration of the 
value of superior communication was staged on 19 June 1815, when Nathan 
Rothschild made a record killing on the London stock market, having used a 
special yacht to bring news of Waterloo many hours in advance of his rivals. 
Important improvements in international communications were effected by the 
International Postal Union (1874), the International Telegraph Union (1875), the 



International Bureau of Weights and Measures (1875), and the Central Bureau 
for Railway Traffic (1890). [photo] 

Capital investment multiplied in proportion to growing returns. Private firms 
reinvested growing profits; governments invested a growing proportion of rising 
taxation. A bottomless demand for capital exhausted the possibilities of private 
borrowing, and revived the potential for joint-stock companies (which in 
England and France, though not Scotland, had been curtailed since the Bubble 
disaster of 1720). From the 1820s the limited joint-stock company became 
familiar all over Europe. These societes anonymes (SA) or Aktiengesellschaft 
(AG) or 'Company Fimited', with their shareholders and their AGMs, paid 
dividends to their investors whilst owing only limited liability to their creditors. 
Soon, through 'horizontal' mergers or 'vertical' contracts, they were combining 
themselves into ever-larger conglomerates-either consolidated trusts or 
confederated cartels. In Britain, where fears of monopoly were strong, trusts and 
cartels were slow to develop. Many of the largest British companies, such as the 
steamship lines P. & O. or Cunard, appeared in the 1840s. But in France cartels 
were common. In united Germany there was little opposition to enormous trusts 
or Konzernen on the American model, which dominated each sector of the 
market. 


BENZ 

In 1885, Carl Benz of Mannheim (1844-1929) built a three-wheeled, self-I 
propelled, petrol-driven motorwagen. Often billed as 'the first motor-car', it 
marked only the mid-point in two centuries of car history. A steam-driven 
vehicle built by Nicholas Cugnot (1725-1804) had earned the name of 
automobile as long ago as 1769. Steam carriages were in widespread service 
by 1850. Gas-driven cars were also tried. But it was the four-stroke, internal- 
combustion engines of Nikolaus Otto (1876), Gottlieb Daimler (1885), and 
Rudolf Diesel (1897) which really gave motor transport its future. 

The original Benz tricycle is exhibited in the Deutsches Museum at 
Munich. It has two 80-spoke, solid-rimmed driving wheels connected to 
differential gears, and one forward guide-wheel steered by an upright handle. 
The engine, underneath a raised bench seat, had electric ignition. It 




developed less than 1 hp, but achieved a speed of 16 kph. There was no 
coachwork. 1 

European motorization was greatly assisted by Andre Michelin's 
pneumatic tyre (1888) and by American methods of mass production (1908). 
Motor cycles, lorries, and buses proliferated. The turn of the century 
welcomed major commercial firms such as Fabbrica Italiana di 
Automobilismo di Torino (FIAT, 1899) and Renault in Paris (1901). The 
Daimler-Benz 'Mercedes' of 1901 and the Rolls-Royce 'Silver Ghost' of 
1906 set new standards of luxury and reliability. (Fenin owned a Rolls- 
Royce.) Two world wars slowed down growing car ownership, but increased 
the number of transport vehicles and of trained drivers. Popular motoring 
reached a landmark with Hitler's inauguration of the Volkswagen 'Beetle' in 
1938. Motoring in Scandinavia was pioneered by Volvo of Gothenburg, and 
in Czechoslovakia by Skoda of Plzen. A Polski Fiat was built under licence 
in inter-war Poland. The era of general motorization reached Western Europe 
after 1950, and the Soviet bloc from the late 1960s. 

The history of technology is bedevilled by claims about 'firsts', which often 
distort the essentially collaborative and cumulative nature of technological 
advance. Yet moments of qualitative change do occur. The difficulty is to 
identify them. When, for example, was the first powered flight? One can 
take one's choice between Faunoy and Bienvenu's model 'bowstring' 
helicopter (1784), Henry Giffard's steam-powered airship (1852), the petrol- 
powered aeroplane (1890) of Clement Ader, whom it carried on a flight of 
50 metres, or the experimental rockets of K. E. Tsiolkovsky. Most reference 
works prefer a flight at Kill Devil Hill (North Carolina) on 17 December 
1903. But they refer to a different category, 'powered and controlled flight'. 2 


PHOTO 

An old barnyard at Chalons-sur-Saone had the distinction of transmitting its 
image onto the world's first photograph. One day in 1826, Joseph Nicephore 
Niepce succeeded in capturing the image on pewter plate after an exposure 




of eight hours. Thirteen years later Niepce's partner, Louis Daguerre (1789- 
1851), was able to market a photographic system which required an 
exposure of thirty minutes onto copper plates covered by light-sensitive 
silver chloride. The Daguerrotype launched a long process of evolution 
which led to the popular box camera, colour film, movies, sound movies, X- 
rays, infra-red and miniature photography, and, most recently, electronic 
camcorders. 1 

The impact of photography on peace and war cannot be exaggerated. It 
helped destroy the raison d'otre of representational art. [impression] It 
transformed people's visual consciousness of themselves and of the world 
around them. It put a powerful tool at the disposal of every branch of science 
and communications. Pictures of the Crimean War brought the realities of 
military conflict to the world's attention, just as family portraits 
revolutionized perceptions of social life. Photography also brought a new 
dimension to the historical record. Fifty years before sound could be 
recorded [sound], photographic collections began to amass real images of all 
aspects of the past. [Auschwitz] 

Yet the realism of photography was deceptive. The art of the retoucher in 
official Soviet photography, for example, was notorious. Stalin removed all 
traces of Trotsky's presence from the record; and Gorbachev's unsightly 
birthmark was removed as late as 1985. But even the honest photographer's 
arbitrary selection of angle, of the momentary snapshot, of light, tone, and 
texture, and, above all, of subject, leaves as much hidden as revealed. The 
camera, like the historian, always lies. 


Domestic markets were boosted by population growth, by the greater 
accessibility of population centres, by expanding affluence, and by the creation 
of entirely new sorts of demand. Among many newcomer industries the most 
important was the chemical industry, which grew from the separation of aniline 
dye stuffs (1856), the Solvay process of soda extraction (1863), and the 
production of artificial fertilizers. A barrage of exciting artificial materials then 
descended, including plastics, concrete, cellophane, celluloid, rayon, viscose, 
aspirin. German names were specially prominent among the chemical pioneers, 
notably Liebig, Hofmann, Bunsen, and Bayer, [mauve] 

Foreign trade was boosted by the opening up of new continents, especially 




America and Africa, by the drive for colonies, by the hunger at home for raw 
materials, by the thirst abroad for an ever-greater range of manufactured goods. 
Foreign and domestic markets became interdependent, [jeans] 

Government policy towards modernization varied in accordance with a 
country's regime, its resources, and its relative position. Few could fail to see the 
benefits; but governments of poor countries, like Russia or Spain, vacillated 
between their shame of backwardness and their fear of dependence. Autocratic 
regimes like Russia could isolate themselves until a decision to accept foreign 
investment was taken. More liberal or more indecisive regimes, like Austria- 
Hungary, could not. 

Once the Industrial Revolution was in motion, a long series of consequences 
ensued. In the purely economic sphere, the growth of the money economy turned 
self-sufficient peasants into wage-earners, consumers, and taxpayers, each with 
new demands and aspirations. Paper banknotes came into general circulation. A 
vast range of new skills and techniques in marketing, advertisement, and 
distribution was nurtured. The deluge of developments in science and 
technology took innovations away from the private inventor and into the realm 
of systematic, sponsored R. & D. The need for financial services great and small 
led to the proliferation of credit associations, savings banks, and insurance 
companies. The multiplication of commercial transactions encouraged the 
standardization of weights, measures, and currencies. 

In the social sphere, urbanization on a massive scale brought a welter of new 
problems, a set of new social classes, and a crop of new public services. The 
latter included paved streets, city transport, street lighting, fire brigades, 
waterworks, gasworks, sewerage works; town-planning, hospitals, parks, and 
police. The old rural distinction between the nobles and the peasants was 
overtaken by the new urban distinction between the middle classes and the 
working classes. Just as the middle classes were conscious of strata within their 
ranks, with professional lawyers and doctors feeling much superior to traders 
and shopkeepers, so the working classes were channelled into hierarchies of their 
own. Wage-labourers formed an important sector of employees both on farms 
and in factories, and as 'navvies' on the ubiquitous construction projects. 
Domestic service in the large number of prosperous middle-class family houses 
provided a vital source of employment for both men and women. Employment in 
the new factories was thought more prestigious than self-employment in the 
older crafts. Skilled, well-paid specialists and foremen could feel themselves 



'proletarian aristocrats' vis-a-vis the unskilled casuals and the urban poor. The 
concept of class based on flexible economic criteria was strongly opposed to the 
older groupings based on birth and legal privilege, and was a central feature of 
modern society. 

The traditional European family household had always been thought to be 
large, complex, stable, and patriarchal. Modern research has challenged some of 
the preconceptions about this 'classic family of Western nostalgia', and has 
shown that the small, simple household and the nuclear family were not 
exclusively modern inventions. Even so, it would be hard to accept that 
modernization did not have a profound effect on family structures. Certainly, it 
was the belief that modern life was destroying the stability of the family that 
motivated Frederic Le Play (1806-82), the pioneer of family history and 
conceptualizer of la familie souche or 'stem family'.- 


MAUVE 


Sometime in 1856 an 18-year-old student began experimenting in the back 
room of his home in the leafy London suburb of Harrow. The boy, later Sir 
William Henry Perkin (1838-1907), was trying to produce a synthetic form 
of the anti-malarial drug, quinine. Instead, by oxidizing aniline sulphate with 
potassium dichromate, he chanced on a new precipitate. When he dried it 
and extracted it in alcohol, he saw a brilliant colour which no one had ever 
seen before. It was the world's first synthetic dye. He called it 'Tyrian 
Purple'. French chemists later called it mauveine after the mallow flower or 
mauve: 1 



Mauveine 


O 


cr 





Two years later, when Perkin was already manufacturing mauveine 
commercially, another youngster from the Royal College of Chemistry, 
Johann Peter Griess, analysed the reaction which accounted for such 
startling results. He established that primary aromatic amines, like aniline, 
when treated with a mixture of hydrochloric acid and sodium nitrite, will 
give diazo compounds. These in turn react with phenolic compounds or 
aromatic amines to give intensely coloured products known as azo dyes. 
Aniline, for example, when treated with a mixture of hydrochloric acid and 
sodium nitrite, gives benzenediazonium chloride. 2 A key feature of this 
'diazo-reaction', as of other dyes, lies in the presence in the molecule of so- 
called chromophores, that is, of groups of atoms which absorb light of a very 
specific wavelength and give the end product a unique colour. 

Where mauveine led the way, other artificial colours followed in 
profusion: Magenta and Violet Imperial (1860), Bleu de Lyon (1862), 
Aniline Yellow and Aniline Black (1863), Dahlia Pink, Perkin's Green, and 
Manchester or Bismarck Brown (1864), Alizarin Red (1871), and London 
Orange (1875). When the British Post Office chose mauveine for printing 
the famous 'Id. lilac' stamps of 1881, it was already falling from fashion. 
But the aesthetics of colour would never be the same again. 

For colour constitutes one of the fundamental properties of matter, and 
hence of human reactions to the environment. In Europe, yellow has 
traditionally been associated with cowardice, red with anger, black with 
depression. Greens and browns are supposed to soothe, blues and reds to 
stimulate. Northern Europeans are thought to prefer subtle, subdued shades; 
the Mediterranean peoples revel in bright, primary colours. 

The invasion of everyday life by unrestricted colour undoubtedly 
triggered a profound change. Prior to mauveine, all colours and pigments 
had to be extracted from natural materials. The root of the madder, Rubia 
tine-torum, was the standard source of reds. Thousands of tons of the plant 
had to be carted to every textile town. Indigo, which the Romans obtained 
from shellfish for their 'imperial purple', was the main source of blues: 
fustic or annatto of yellow. Some shades and colours, notably green, could 
only be achieved by double dyeing. A semi-artificial red called murexide 
was produced in France c.1850 by treating bird-droppings with nitric acid. 

After mauveine, however, the supply of dazzling hues knew few bounds. 
By the late twentieth century the number of synthetic dyes produced 



commercially in Europe had risen to over 4.000. 3 Garish posters, gaudy 
clothes, and glamorous wallpaper-not to mention 'technicolor' films, 
colour photographs, and colour television-delight or disgust the post¬ 
industrial age in ways that the pre-industrials could not have imagined. 

England's initial lead soon passed to Germany, where Friedrich Bayer 
(1825-80) founded his first aniline dyestuffs factory in a washhouse at 
Wuppertal-Barmen in 1863. 4 Bayer, BASF (Badische Anilin und Soda 
Fabrik), and Hoechst quickly turned Germany into the world capital of 
chemicals. By 1890, Germany's chemical industry was twenty times larger 
than Britain's. 5 The conglomerate of I.G. Farben, like Britain's ICI, was set 
up after the First World War. 5 

Synthetic dyes soon led scientists into fields unknown to the early dye- 
masters. By producing all the many categories of synthetic and semi¬ 
synthetic materials which have since been invented, modern chemistry has 
shattered the assumption that Nature or God alone could design the inner 
structure of substances. Synthetic dyes preceded the first semi-synthetic 
material- Parkseine or Celluloid (1862), and the semi-artificial fibre 
-viscose (1891). They foreshadowed the invention of synthetic drugs such 
as phenacetin (1888), asprin (1899), salvarsan (1910), acriflavine (1916), 
and heroin; the isolation of hormones such as insulin (1921) or thy-roxin 
(1926), which were eventually synthesized; and the production of 
chloramphenicol (1950), the first synthetic antibiotic. 

Chemistry became an art as well as a science. Its creations, which began 
to proliferate wildly after Baekeland's Bakelite (1907), Raschig's amino- 
plastics (1909), and of Ostromislensky's polyvinyl chloride or PVC (1912), 
have become an essential component of material life. Yet from the day in 
1864 when the Empress Eugenie of France wore a gown in tri- 
phenylmethane green, synthetic products were shown to have aesthetic as 
well as practical qualities. 


JEANS 




Genes' is the French name for Genoa, and by extension for a traditional 
style of trousers worn by Genoese sailors. Serge de Nimes was the name of a 
tough blue sailcloth, now corrupted to 'denim', traditionally woven in the 
French town. Levi Strauss (1829-1902) was a native of Bavaria who 
emigrated to New York at the age of fourteen and who joined his brothers in 
their business of supplying the prospectors and frontiersmen of the 
Californian Gold Rush. Some time in the 1860s Levi's company had the idea 
of matching the clenim cloth with the Genoese trousers, and of strengthening 
the pockets and seams with brass horse-harness rivets. Thus was produced 
the most durable and universal item in the history of fashion design-a 
German immigrant using French materials and Italian style to invent an 
archetypal American product. 

'Blue jeans' remained workaday clothing in North America for almost a 
century, before taking Europe (and the rest of the world) by storm in the 
1960s, a prime symbol of 'Americanization'. 1 


Women's circumstances were radically transformed. Traditional rural life had 
assured women of an equitable division of shared labour, and the presence of an 
extended family which eased the pressures of child-bearing and motherhood. 
Modern urban life turned the man into a primary 'breadwinner', and left the 
woman either as a lonely homemaker and domestic manageress or, in the case of 
the working class, as a thrice-burdened outworker, housekeeper, and parent. Not 
surprisingly, beyond the prim parlours of polite society lay a teeming underworld 
of prostitution, desperation, and early death. 

Industrialization brought wave after wave of migration: first on a local or 
seasonal basis from village to factory; next on a regional basis from the 
countryside to the towns; and, from the 1850s onwards, on an international and 
an intercontinental basis to all the industrial cities of Europe and the USA. 
Unregulated migration brought in its turn urban overcrowding, vagrancy, 
housing shortages, homelessness, epidemics of typhus and cholera, 
unemployment amidst prosperity, persistent and irremediable poverty. With 
much delay, the worst epidemics, such as the Europe-wide outbreaks of cholera 
in 1830-5,1847-8,1853-6,1865-7, 1869-74,1883-7, and 1893-5, provoked a 
revolution in public and private hygiene and the institution of communal health 




services, [sanitas] Medical progress eventually resulted in a startling drop in the 
death rate and in infant mortality. 

Rising population, however, compounded the evils of overpopulation in the 
villages, and of sweatshops, child labour, inhuman working hours, female 
exploitation, and unspeakable sorrow in the slums. Organized crime thrived on 
poverty and the psychopathology of urban living. It spawned a new underclass 
of committed criminals, the new idea of professional police forces modelled on 
Scotland Yard, a new profession of detectives, a new rash of prison building, 
and, with The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (1894), a new literary genre-the 
crime thriller. 

The terrible contrast between rich and poor has never been better described 
than by Benjamin Disraeli (1804-81), novelist and prime minister. In Sybil 
(1845) Disraeli wrote of 'Two nations between whom there is no intercourse and 
no sympathy; who are as ignorant of each other's habits, thoughts, and feelings 
as if they were ... inhabitants of different planets'.- The description was accurate 
enough; but the accusation was not altogether fair. The nineteenth century also 
saw a huge explosion of private charities. [caritas] 

In the cultural sphere, education vastly expanded its frontiers. Town dwellers 
could no longer function without basic literacy and numeracy: universal primary 
education became necessary for children of both sexes. Technical education was 
required for the army of fitters, technicians, and apprentices; higher scientific 
education for the corps of engineers and researchers. Government and business 
leaders called for secondary schools of a new type to train the executive cadres 
of the civil service, the colonial departments, and industry. Women's education 
was launched. Mass literacy, however, opened the way for new forms of mass 
culture: popular magazines, trash novels, romances, and whodunnits, comics, 
self-help almanacs, family reference works. Regular incomes created the 
possibility of new forms of leisure and recreation: musical associations, family 
holidays, tourism, mountaineering, and sport, football for the workers, golf for 
the bosses, [relax-atiohtour] The mania for physical pursuits, which was a 
product of cramped urban living, combined with the mania for education to 
create a number of hybrid youth movements such as the widespread 'Sokol' 
associations in central Europe or Scouting for Boys and Guiding for Girls 
(1908). Religious culture responded in tune. Literate children could not be 
expected simply to learn their catechism by rote. The church halls of urban 
parishes became the focal point of social, charitable, and temperance activities. 


In the Protestant countries evangelical fundamentalism, Sunday schools, and 
Bible-reading classes proliferated. In the Catholic countries the Church 
organized the first industrial parishes, worker-priests, and private Catholic 
primary schools. In the universities, with scholars struggling to comprehend the 
changing world about them, a whole new range of social sciences made their 
appearance-economics, ethnography, anthropology, linguistics, sociology. Each 
of the new disciplines were to have a profound influence on the recognized 
fields of study: philosophy, science, history, and literature. 


SANITAS 

In 1829 the city of Orenburg in the Urals was hit by an unprecedented I 
wave of cholera. In 1830 the same cholera hit Moscow. In 1831 it marched 
with the Russian Army against Poland before spreading to Hungary, Austria, 
and Prussia. It reached London in February 1832, Paris in March, 
Amsterdam in June, and thence spread to Scandinavia. The Spaniards tried 
to protect themselves behind a decree passing the death sentence on all non- 
quarantined immigrants. But in January 1833 cholera reached Oporto, and 
entered Spain through Portugal. Though no one knew it, Europe stood in the 
front line of the second of six pandemics of cholera that were to sweep 
repeatedly round the world for the next ninety years; and Russia was 
Europe's bacterial gateway. 1 [epidemia] 

The effects of the pandemic were all the more deadly since its workings 
were not yet fully understood. Cholera is the old Greek word for 'gutter', 
and accurately described the violent intestinal flux that could empty out a 
sufferer's substance in a couple of days. Medical opinion is unsure whether 
earlier forms of this dysentery-like illness, under a variety of names, had in 
fact been the same. But the guilty agent was eventually identified in 1883 as 
a bacterium, vibrio cholerae 01, which infected the small intestine after 
being imbibed with contaminated water. First observed by British Army 
doctors in India, the launch-pad of all the pandemics, physicians eventually 
realized that it could best be prevented by a clean water supply and best 
treated by simple rehydration techniques. The initial outbreak of 1817-23 
had moved eastwards round Asia. But all subsequent pandemics-in 1829- 
51, 1852-9, 1863-79, 1881-96, and 1899-1923-visited Europe with a 




vengeance. The second pandemic, which had raged for fifteen years in the 
USA, came round again for a final fling in Europe in 1847-51. In Britain 
53,000 died in 1848, and a similar number died in France in 1849. In 1851 a 
statue was erected in Paris to implore God's mercy on cholera's helpless 
victims. 

Help, however, was to hand. Cholera had the distinction of provoking 
Europe's first co-ordinated initiatives for public health, at both the national 
and the international level. In 1848 a General Board of Health was 
established in London to address the foul conditions and high death rates in 
Britain's burgeoning cities. Fortified by Disraeli's great Public Health Act 
(1875), which held all local authorities responsible for efficient sewage 
treatment, drainage, and water supply, it protected the United Kingdom most 
effectively. By the fourth pandemic, British losses of c. 15,000 were only 
one-tenth of those experienced in Russia, Germany, Italy or Austria- 
Hungary. After the fifth pandemic, when Hamburg (1893) lost over 8,000 
citizens, and Moscow and St Petersburg (1893-4) over 800,000, Britain 
could boast that it had already warded off its last indigenous case of cholera. 

In 1851 Napoleon III took the initiative of convening the founding 
International Health Conference in Paris. Its purpose was to exchange 
information about the spread and prevention of disease, especially cholera. 
At the time neither Pasteur nor Lister had made the pioneering discoveries of 
bacteriology, but it led to a regular series of conferences on hygiene, and in 
1907 to the International Health Organization in Paris, the forerunner of the 
WHO. By then, especially in Poland, Cholera! only remained as one of 
Europe's favourite swear-words. 

Ironically, no sooner had Europe tamed cholera than an aberrant strain of 
influenza surpassed all of cholera's triumphs. Traced to an outbreak of swine 
fever in Iowa in January 1918, the influenza pandemic of 1918-19 sailed to 
Europe with the US army. Known as the Blitzkatarrh, the 'Flanders Grippe', 
and, through the infection of the King of Spain, as The Spanish Lady', it 
specialized in prime young adults, particularly women. During the terminal 
months of the First World War it devastated Germany, where influenza was 
not even a notifiable disease, paralysing the workforce of major cities, 
interrupting deliveries and troop movements. In three terrible peaks-July 
1918, October 1918, and February 1919-it destroyed millions of 
Europeans, possibly 40 million world-wide. '[This pandemic] killed more 



humans in a couple of months than any scourge in history.' 2 


In the psychological sphere, urban and industrial life fostered attitudes that 
were entirely foreign to country dwellers. The factory hooter, the railway 
timetable, the need for punctuality and sobriety were all innovations that a 
peasant might find strange and irksome. Consumerism and compulsory thrift 
were complementary reactions of the fearful spender let loose on an unfamiliar 
market. Class-consciousness was born of anxious people uncertain of their status 
in a strangely mobile society. National consciousness was bred in newly 
educated generations who in their rural villages had never given a moment's 
thought to their identity or their language. Political consciousness was aroused in 
generations who were no longer helpless serfs and who could cultivate personal 
opinions about the rights and wrongs of political events. Indeed, national and 
political consciousness was often aroused most fiercely in those countries where 
a repressed population was deprived of free expression and a free vote. Lastly, 
there was the psychology of late nineteenth-century imperialism, where a whole 
generation of parvenu Europeans were taught to look down on other races and 
cultures in ways that secure and settled societies would not have embraced. 

In the political sphere, governments faced new types of challenge. They were 
no longer addressing themselves to their own narrow elite but to a mass audience 
of taxpayers, holding a wide variety of views expressed with growing confidence 
and sophistication. They could not restrict political life indefinitely to the 
traditional male propertied caste; and they were increasingly faced with 
organized campaigns for universal male suffrage and later for women's suffrage. 
The majority of Europeans were enfranchised between 1848 and 1914. As a 
result, political parties sprang up, each with a mass following and each devoted 
to the interests of liberals, conservatives, Catholics, peasants, workers, or 
whatever. Governments had also to institute a wide range of specialized 
ministries and to run a bulging bureaucracy that had a mind and will of its own. 
They were employers on a grand scale, and were forced to consider the welfare 
of their employees with National Insurance and pensions. They had to reorganize 
local government to suit the needs of self-important cities and of freshly 
populated provinces, and hence to rethink the entire relationship between capital 
and periphery. They had to cope with a wide range of professional, commercial, 
and industrial associations-and, most particularly in the second half of the 




century, the trade unions-who claimed the right to act as pressure-groups long 
before they were formally integrated into political life. 


CARITAS 

In 1818 the Netherlands Maatschaapij van Weldadigheid (Benevolent I 
Society) opened a complex of labour colonies for the care of the 
unemployed. They conformed to a much older Dutch tradition for correcting 
the idle, [batavia] One colony at Veenhuizen catered for up to 4,000 men 
convicted of begging. Another at Leyden catered for indigent women. Three 
Tree colonies' at Frederiksoord, Willemsoord, and Wilhelminasoord were 
designed to teach agricultural skills to voluntary inmates. In due course, they 
were funded by the state. Similar institutions came into being in Germany, 
Belgium, and Switzerland, often under military-style discipline. 1 They are 
examples both of the growing provision of social care in nineteenth-century 
Europe and also of growing regimentation. As with the workhouses 
introduced by the English Poor Law Amendment Act (1834), it was assumed 
that able-bodied recipients of charity would have to work. 

Charity in various forms had been practised since ancient times. But the 
fundamental Christian principles were laid down by St Thomas Aquinas, 
who distinguished seven 'spiritual aids' and seven 'good works'. The former 
were listed as consule (counsel), carpe (sustain), doce (teach), solare 
(console), remitte (rescue), fer (pardon), and ora (pray); the latter as vestio 
(clothe), poto (to give water), cibo (feed), redimo (redeem from prison), tego 
(shelter), colligo (nurse), and condo (bury). From this, one could determine 
the classes of unfortunates to whom charity was to be extended. They 
included the bewildered, the weak, the illiterate, the bereaved, the oppressed, 
the criminal, the sinful, the stranger, the ragged, the hungry, the imprisoned, 
the homeless, the sick, the mad, and the dead. Christian teaching was 
emphatic: 'Faith, Hope and Charity: these three,' says St. Paul, 'but the 
greatest of these is Charity.' 2 For it is Charity meaning 'love for one's 
neighbour' that begets charity meaning 'generous giving'. 

In medieval times, the burden of care had fallen on the Church, and was 




funded from the tithe. St Bernard launched the charitable tradition in 
monasteries, St Francis the tradition of social action within the community. 
Both had many successors. Royal, aristocratic, and municipal patrons were 
moved to found a widespread network of maisons-Dieu for the sick and 
infirm, of hospices for pilgrims, wayfarers, and strangers, of alms-houses for 
the deserving poor, and of leprosaria. A large city like London possessed a 
number of more specialized institutions, such as St Bartholomew's Hospital, 
St Mary's of Bethlehem, or 'Bedlam', for the insane, and St Mary's 
'Converts' Inn' for Jewish converts expelled by their own community. 3 As 
elsewhere, prosperous merchants such as Sir Richard Whittington (d. 1423), 
sometime Lord Mayor, left generous endowments, [leper] [mercante] 

This medieval system began to fracture in the Reformation period, 
particularly in the Protestant countries. The dissolution of the English 
monasteries (1540) had social consequences with which the hard-pressed 
Elizabethan Poor Laws could not cope. Modern Europe was obliged to seek 
new solutions. As the population grew, charitable institutions became much 
larger and more specialized. Purpose-built veterans' homes, mental asylums, 
houses of correction, prisons, medical 'infirmaries', workhouses, labour 
colonies, and charity schools were multiplying fast in the eighteenth and 
nineteenth centuries. Liberal and humanitarian movements pressed for the 
abolition of slavery, torture, and of degrading conditions. The burden of 
funding and administration passed from the Church to parish and city 

councils, to private benevolent societies, and eventually to the state, [picaro] 
[TORMENTA] 

The expansion of charitable activities has usually been seen, in the Whig 
tradition, as evidence for the onward march of civilization. Some historians, 
however, have thought otherwise. They point out that, while the institutions 
of social care greatly expanded, they subjected the evergrowing army of 
inmates to ever-rising levels of repression. The recipients may not have 
feared the gross physical brutalities of times past, but rigorous regimes of 
psychological and moral coercion could rob them of their freedom, their 
dignity, and their individuality. Regimentation was on the rise across a wide 
spectrum of social life, on the military parade-ground, in the school 
classroom, in factories, in the hospital ward, in the workhouses. It was seen 
by its originators as the necessary price for efficiency. 

But there may have been a darker side. One has to wonder whether the 
regimentation of the masses was not somehow connected with the drive 



towards more liberal political institutions. Unremitting labour was the fate of 
both the employed and the unemployed. And as Nietzsche remarked 
cynically: 'Work is the most efficient form of policing. 5 Political controls 
could only be relaxed when social controls were tightened. 

This line of thought is implicit in the work of the French philosopher and 
historian Michel Foucault (1926-84). Himself a sado-masochist who died of 
AIDS, he was determined to explore extreme experiences, and he came to be 
an unsparing critic of modern social reform. His studies of the history of 
mental asylums, which locked the most vulnerable persons out of sight, or of 
sexual attitudes, which drove basic human drives into the realm of hypocrisy 
and taboo, caused him to pronounce modern times to be 'the Age of 
Repression 5 . 4 All social relationships are determined by power. 'Bourgeois 
society 5 , he declared, 'was a society of blatant and fragmented perversion.' 5 
He raises issues to which the inmates of those nineteenth-century labour 
colonies may have been quite sympathetic. 


Finally, in the military sphere, both generals and politicians had to 
contemplate conflicts where civilians and women would be recruited to the war 
effort, where conscript armies of unheard-of size would be mobilized, and where 
staff officers armed with railway timetables would marshal men armed with 
machine-guns onto ground that could be subjected to 20 tons of high-explosive 
shell-fire per square foot per hour. Of all the challenges, this was the one which 
by 1914 they were least equipped to face. Reflections on the implications of 
warfare did not lead Europeans to reduce their military establishments. Kant, in 
1797, had issued the definitive moral condemnation. 'War 5 , he wrote at the end 
of his Metaphysics of Manners, 'ought to have no place there. 5 But much more 
common was the assumption of De Maistre that war was 'the habitual state of 
the human species 5 . The treatise On War (1832), written by the Prussian general 
Karl von Clausewitz (1780-1831), was one of the most lucid and influential 
books of the century. 'War 5 , he wrote, 'is the continuation of politics by other

Recounting the onward march of modernization, it is easy to give the 
impression that the road was smooth and the direction obvious. But such an 
impression would be false. The territory was often hostile, the obstacles 
enormous, the accidents unremitting. For every entrepreneur there was an 




aristocrat who did not want the railway to cross his land; for every machine there 
was a dispossessed craftsman who wanted to smash it; for every fresh factory, 
abandoned villages: for every shining city hall, slums. Of every ten children born 
into that Europe of pride and progress, three or four died. Economic growth did 
not mount on a steady upward curve: the new capitalism was capricious. Violent 
booms alternated with sudden slumps; the first decade of peace after 1815 
witnessed a prolonged recession throughout Europe. Later periods of recession 
occurred after 1848, and after 1871. All periods contained shorter cycles of 
advance and retreat. Wages and prices moved by fits and starts. In the past, 
economic crises had been caused by visible things like plague or famine. Now 
they were said to be caused by inexplicable things like over-production, market 
conditions, or monetary failure. Average material conditions were definitely 
improving; but for individual families they often spelt unfamiliar wealth or 
desperate penury. Materially, European society was better off; psychologically, 
Europeans were seriously disturbed. 

None the less, the world created by European modernization was incredibly 
rich for its chief, middle-class beneficiaries-rich in material possessions, rich in 
variety, rich in culture and style, rich in new experiences. A university professor 
in Scotland in the 1880s might earn £600 annually, ten times the upper reaches 
of the working class and equivalent to the price of a six-bedroomed house. In 
1890-1 the seventeen official nationalities of Austria-Hungary shared 215 
registered spas and 1,801 newspapers and periodicals. 'La Belle Epoque' was the 
time when people went waltzing, dined at the Cafe Royale, bought pictures by 
the Impressionists, lived in the luxury of Art Nouveau. 'A French politician like 
Edouard Herriot, mayor of Lyons, could speak excellent German, and hold his 
own on Wagner and Kant.' In 1895 Henry James, the American novelist living in 
Europe, acquired electric lighting; in 1896 he rode a bicycle; in 1897 he wrote 
on a typewriter. And that was in a period which a British Royal Commission had 
called 'the Great Depression'. Money was increasing in real value as prices 
gently fell. The poor, at least, could eat cheap food. Only the landowning 
aristocracy squeaked, appalled at their shrinking fortunes. There was no major 
war for more than forty years. 'It looked as if this world would go on for ever.' 2 

Demographic growth was one of the surest indicators of Europe's dynamism. 
In brute terms, the population rose from c.150 million in 1800 to over 400 
million by 1914. The accelerating rate of increase was more than twice as great 
as in the previous three centuries (see Appendix III, p. 1294). Europeans were 
reminded of the implications from the start. In 1816 the English economist 


Thomas Malthus (1766-1834) published the final edition of his depressing Essay 
on the Principle of Population. He predicted that, while the production of food 
might rise arithmetically, the growth of population would proceed geometrically. 
If he had been correct, Europeans would have begun to starve to death within a 
few decades. Indeed, some thought that the Irish Potato Famine of the 1840s was 
a premonition of the general disaster, [famine] 

The British Isles, with a limited supply of arable land and a rocketing 
population, looked specially vulnerable. In the event, the general disaster never 
occurred. Such famines as did occur, as in Ireland, struck in the most backward 
mral districts of Europe, in Galicia and on the Volga, not in Europe's over¬ 
crowded cities. The point came in the 1870s when large amounts of grain began 
to be imported from North America. But several European countries, such as 
Ukraine and France, showed a healthy surplus, and food prices in 1870-1900 
were falling everywhere. At no time did the overall situation become critical. 

The dynamics of European demography came to be much better understood 
in the course of the century. Sweden had been exceptional in carrying out a 
general census as early as 1686; but every European government now began a 
regular series: France and Great Britain from 1801, the German Customs Union 
from 1818, Austria-Hungary from 1857, Italy from 1861, Russia from 1897. By 
the turn of the century sophisticated statistics were available for all countries. (In 
Eastern Europe they were far superior to much that the twentieth century 
produced.) 

Europe's overall population gains were due to natural increase. The annual 
birth rate was highest early in the century, when death rates were also high; but 
in the 1900s it was still buoyant, up to 40 per 1,000 in many countries. With the 
help of medical advances, death rates were halved from c.40 to 20 per 1,000. 
With the curious exception of France, fertility and reproductive enthusiasm were 
much higher than ever before or since. The growth of cities was dramatic: by 
1914 Europe had a dozen million-plus conurbations. London, Paris, Berlin, 
Vienna, St Petersburg, and Istanbul had reached that status earlier on; Glasgow, 
Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Birmingham, the Ruhr, Hamburg, and Moscow 
followed later. Another score of cities, from Madrid to Odessa, had passed the 
half-million mark. Numbers in the rural population remained fairly static in the 
developed countries, although their proportion plummeted. In Great Britain in 
1900 they represented only 8 per cent, in Germany they stood at 40 per cent, 
having dropped from 75 per cent in 30 years. In the underdeveloped countries, 



where they could represent up to 80 per cent, as in Russia, they were rising 
alarmingly. Europe lost 25 million emigrants to the USA in the last quarter of the 
century. One-quarter of the population of Galicia emigrated in the two decades 
before 1914 (see Appendix III, p. 1294). 

Historians disagree whether the stunning social and economic changes of the 
nineteenth century should be regarded merely as 'the background' to cultural life 
or its determinant. Marx, for example, was a determinist: 'in his view all forms 
of thought and consciousness are determined by the class struggle, which in turn 
is determined by the underlying economic relations.' (If this is true, then Marx 
himself was not so much an original thinker as the product of his time.) At the 
other extreme, there are those who maintain that culture has a life of its own. 
Nowadays, most people would at least accept the midway proposition that 
culture cannot be properly understood without reference to its political, social, 
and economic context. 

Romanticism, which became a dominant intellectual trend in many European 
countries in the second quarter of the nineteenth century, is seen by some 
historians essentially as a reaction to the Enlightenment. By others it is seen as 
an emanation of attitudes generated by the Industrial Revolution and the 
Napoleonic Wars. Actually it was all of these things. The circumstances of its 
origins in the 1770s were closely connected indeed to the fading appeal of the 
Enlightenment (see Chapter IX). At the same time, the reasons for its mass 
appeal in the 1820s and 1830s were closely bound up with the experiences of a 
generation which lived through the revolutionary ordeal, which felt the impact of 
machines and factories, and which fumed after 1815 under the dead weight of 
the reactionary regimes. Romanticism found expression almost everywhere, 
even in Russia, treating the Catholic/Protestant and the Catholic/Orthodox divide 
with indifference. It affected all the arts, but especially poetry, painting, and 
music, and all branches of the humanities. It grew very strong in Germany. It 
was well represented in Britain, though the first British Romantics like Lord 
Byron were better received on the Continent than at home. After some delay, it 
appeared in force in France and Italy, as a counterweight to the deep-rooted 
traditions of classicism and rationalism. In Poland and in Hungary, where it was 
coloured by the agonies of national defeat, it became the dominant mode of 
thought. 

The main tenets of the Romantic movement opposed everything which the 



Enlightenment had stood for. Where the Enlightenment had stressed the power 
of Reason, the Romantics were attracted by ah in human experience that is 
irrational: by the passions, by the supernatural and paranormal, by superstitions, 
pain, madness, and death. Where the Enlightenment had stressed man's growing 
mastery over nature, the Romantics took delight in trembling before nature's 
untamed might: in the terror of storms and waterfalls, the vastness of mountains, 
the emptiness of deserts, the loneliness of the seas. Where the Enlightenment had 
followed the classical taste for harmony and restraint, and for the rules which 
underlay civilized conventions, the Romantics courted everything which defied 
established convention: the wild, the quaint, the exotic, the alien, the deranged. 
Where the Enlightenment had sought to expound the order underlying the 
apparent chaos of the world, the Romantics appealed to the hidden inner 'spirits' 
of everything that lives and moves. Where the Enlightenment was either 
unreligious or anti-religious, the Romantics were profoundly religious by 
temperament even, where they scorned conventional Christian practice. Where 
the Enlightenment catered for an intellectual elite, the Romantics catered for the 
newly liberated and educated masses, [parnasse] [relaxatio] 

The Europe-wide appeal of Romanticism can be illustrated in many ways, 
but nowhere better than in its poetry. John Keats (1795-1821) languished 
archaically before the charms of a medieval maiden: 

O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms, 

Alone and palely loitering? 

The sedge is withered from the lake, 

And no birds sing.- 

Alphonse de Lamartine (1790-1869) revelled simultaneously in the beauties of 
the Lac du Bourget and in thoughts of eternity: 

6 temps, suspends ton vol! et vous, heures propices, 
Suspendez votre cours! 

Laissez-nous savourer les rapides delices 
Des plus beaux de nos jours. 

(Oh, Time, suspend your flight! And you, auspicious hours, I suspend your 
course! I Allow us to savour the fleeting delights I of our most beautiful days.)- 


Giacomo Leopardi (1798-1837) sang the 'Night Song of a Wandering Shepherd 
of Asia': 


PARNASSE 

On the summer of 1835, a walking-party which included the Hungarian 
pianist Franz Liszt and the French writer Georges Sand checked into the 
Hotel de FUnion in Geneva. Their comments in the hotel register said much

Public Opinion 1 


In 1835 the idea of 'Europe' was hardly less fantastic than that of 
'Parnassus'. 


Pur tu, solinga, eterna peregrina, 
che si pensosa sei, tu forse intendi, 
questo viver tereno, 
il patir nostro, il sospirar, che sia; 
che sia questo morir, questo supremo 
scolorar del sembiante 
e perir dalla terra, e venir meno 
ad ogni usata, amante compagnia... 






(Yet, lonely, eternal wanderer, I who are so thoughtful, perhaps you understand I 
what this earthly life may be, I our suffering and sighing, I and what this dying 
is, this ultimate I fading of the features, I and perishing from the earth, and 
falling away I from every familiar, loving company.)- 


Joseph, Freiherr von Eichendorff (1788-1857), recounted his favourite themes of 
Lust (desire), Heimat (homeland), and Waldeinsamkeit (forest loneliness) in his 
native Silesia: 


In einem kiihlen Grunde, Da geht ein Miihlenrad, Mein' 
Liebste ist verschwunden, Die dort gewohnet hat... 

Sie hat mir Treu' versprochen, Gab mir ein'n Ring dabei, 
Sie hat die Treu gebrochen, Mein Ringlein sprang 
entzwei. 


(In a cool and shady hollow The old mill wheel is 
turning. But my loved one has departed From where she 
once was dwelling. 

She promised to be my true love, And sealed it with a 
ring. Now all her vows are broken, And shattered is the 
ring. 


RELAXATIO 

On 14 July 1865 a young English illustrator and mountaineer, Edward 
Whymper, climbed the Matterhorn, or Monte Cervino, at the seventh 
attempt. On the way down from the 4,440 m (14,566 ft) pyramid of rock, 
which towers over Zermatt, four of Whymper's party fell to their deaths. 1 

This was by no means the first major alpine ascent. Mont Blanc had been 
climbed by Ferdinand de Saussure in 1799. But Whymper's tragic feat 
publicized the new sport of alpinism, and underlined changing attitudes to 
recreation. No more was sport to be the preserve of a leisured elite. Nor was 
it to be confined to the traditional pursuits of hunting, shooting, fishing, 
riding, 'taking the waters', and the Grand Tour. Europeans of all sorts were 
looking for new sports, new challenges, and new sources of physical fitness. 

Less than two years earlier, the Football Association had been founded at a 
meeting in the Freemasons ' Tavern in London on 26 October 1863. The aim 
was to standardize the rules of football, and to provide the framework for 
organized competition. (Representatives with other ideas about the game 
went off to found the Rugby Union.) Professional clubs soon followed; and 
the English Football League was created in 1888. 2 





Football of the FA's 'soccer' variety spread rapidly to the Continent. By 
the end of the century it had established itself as Europe's most popular sport 
and most frequented spectator entertainment. The International Federation of 
Association Football (FIFA) was founded in Paris in May 1904 by 
representatives from Austria, Belgium, Denmark, England, Finland, France, 
Germany, Hungary, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and 
Switzerland. It was the most egalitarian of games. As the ancient proverb 
went: 'All are fellows at football.' 3 


Hor' ich das Muhlrad gehen: Ich weiss nicht, was ich When I listen to the mill wheel, I lack all thought and 
will- Ich mocht' am liebsten sterben, Da war's auf will. The best course is to perish For then would all be 
einmal still! still.)- 

And Juliusz Slowacki (1809-49), intense and eloquent, celebrated the exalted 
inner life: 

Kto mogac wybrad, wybrat zamiast domu, 

Gniazdo na skalach orla, niechaj umie 
Spac" gdy irenice czerwone od gromu 
I stychac j^k szatanow w sosen szumie. 

(Whoever, having the choice, in place of a home, would choose I an eagle's nest 
on the cliffs, may he know how I to sleep though his eyes be reddened from the 
lightning I and to listen to the moaning of the spirits in the murmur of the 
pines.)- 

In due course Romanticism elicited a reaction against its own heady success. 
The reaction took the form of a revival of the ideals of Classicism: in short, of 
Neo-classicism. Thereafter, the rival trends remained major influences 
throughout the century. Their rivalry was specially evident in architecture. Rival 
railway companies would build their terminal stations in contrasting styles: the 
London and North Western built Euston Station in elegant classic; the Midland 
Railway built the adjoining St Paneras Station in flamboyant Neo-gothic. 

The Classical-Romantic mix was particularly fruitful in literature. The three 
giants of the age, Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837), Adam Mickiewicz (1798- 
1855), and J. W. Goethe, defy easy classification, exactly because their works 
fuse Classical and Romantic elements into an indivisible whole. Their 





masterworks- Eugene Onegin (1832), Pan Tadeusz (1834), and Faust (1808- 
32) were all verse-novels or verse-dramas, completed at almost the same 
moment. Their supreme mastery of language at a juncture when literacy was 
spreading rapidly gave their authors the status of national bards, making their 
lines and phrases an integral part of everyday communication. There is not a 
Pole who cannot recite 'Oh, Litwo, my homeland, you are like health ...'; not a 
German who has not been bewitched by 'the land where the lemon-trees bloom'; 
no Russian schoolchild who has not been taught the lines of 'The Bronze 
Horseman' from St Petersburg:

appearance, | The Neva's majestic current, | the granite of her banks... | City of 
Peter, stand in all your splendour, | Stand unshakeable as Russia! | May the 
conquered elements, too, make their peace.)- 

Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832), however, was not merely a 
national bard. He was an Olympian who bestrode almost all intellectual 
domains. The variety of genres in which he excelled, his awareness of a rapidly 
changing world, and the numerous evolutions through which his creativity 
passed gave him a claim to be the last 'universal man'. Born in Frankfurt-am- 
Main, educated in Leipzig and Strasburg, and resident for half a century in 
Weimar, he was poet, dramatist, novelist, philosopher, scientist, traveller, lawyer, 
administrator. His initial Romantic proclivities faded in the 1780s; his classical 


phase, strengthened by his friend Schiller, continued until c.1820. The vast 
psychological panorama of Faust embraced a lifetime's reflections on the human 
condition. When he died, he was the greatest personality of Europe's greatest 
cultural era, endlessly reaching for the unreachable: 

Alies Vergangliche 
1st nur ein Gleichnis; 

Das Unzulangliche 
Hier wird's Ereignis; 

Das Unbeschreibliche, 

Hier ist's getan; 

Das Ewig-Weibliche 
Zieht uns hinan. 

(All transient things I Are only a parable; I The inaccessible I Here becomes 
reality; I Here the ineffable is achieved; I The Eternal Feminine I Draws us 
on.)- 

The later phase of Romanticism acquired a specially morbid flavour. It has 
been related to the tuberculosis from which many artists suffered, and to the 
opium which was routinely prescribed to cure it. A seminal figure was Thomas 
De Quincey (1785-1859), who ran away from Manchester Grammar School and 
who lived as a homeless stray before becoming an Oxford drug addict. His 
Confessions of an English Opium Eater (1822) exercised a formative influence 
on the American writer of the grotesque, Edgar Allan Poe, and on Baudelaire. 
The strange, mystical outpourings of Slowacki's last years belong to this same 
story,- as do the verses of Gerard Labrunie or de Nerval (1808-55), a 
schizophrenic, the 'super-Romantic', The most Romantic of them all': 

Ou sont nos amoureuses? 

Elies sont au tombeau. 

(Where are our lovers, our girls? They are in their tomb.)- 

In the apparent derangement, and the interest in visions and hallucinations, it is 
not difficult to see the early seeds of the Symbolism, Freudianism, and 
Decadence which were to form such important elements of Modernism (see 
below). 

The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was founded in 1848 in a house on Gower 


Street, London, by a circle of poets and painters who congregated round Dante 
Gabriel Rossetti (1828-82), the son of a Neapolitan exile. Despite Continental 
sources of inspiration, it remained an exclusively English movement, but 
archetypal of the age. Apart from the Rossetti brothers, its leading members 
included J. E. Millais (1829-96), W. Holman Hunt (1827-1910), Ford Madox 
Brown (1821-93), and Edward Burne-Jones (1833-98); and it found a champion 
in the critic John Ruskin (1819-1900). The group took its name from its 
members' common enthusiasm for the art of the Italian quattrocento, which 
fuelled their rebellion against contemporary academic painting. They were 
strongly exercised by the links between art and literature-D. G. Rossetti being 
the translator of both Dante and Villon-and applied their principles to 
everything from architecture and furniture to mosaics, tapestry, stained glass, and 
interior design. They cultivated what they took to be both the techniques and, 
above ah, the spirit of late medieval art. They imitated the clarity of form and 
brightness of colour of icono-graphic painting; and they exuded a moral 
seriousness, often expressed in mystical religiosity. Among their most celebrated 
images would be Millais's Ophelia (1851) and Hunt's The Light of the World 
(1854). One of their later recruits was William Morris (1834-96), poet, primitive 
socialist, craftsman, printer, and designer. At Kelmscott Manor Morris hosted 
some of the Brotherhood's most inspired activities, long after the group as a 
whole had broken up. 

That same era also saw the efflorescence of the novel across the Continent. 
Honore de Balzac (1799-1850) and Charles Dickens (1812-70), born en face at 
Rouen and Portsmouth, were among the first to capture the popular imagination. 
But in time all the major novels were translated into all major European 
languages. Critics differ in their estimations; but the parade of the premier 
division should certainly include I promessi sposi (The Betrothed, 1825) by 
Alessandro Manzoni, Balzac's Le Pere Goriot (1834), Dickens's Oliver Twist 
(1838), Mikhail Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time (1840), Charlotte Bronte's 
Jane Eyre (1847), W. M. Thackeray's Vanity Fair (1848), Madame Bovary 
(1857) by Gustave Flaubert, Victor Hugo's Les Miserables (1862), Leo Tolstoy's 
Anna Karenina (1877), Fyodor Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment (1866) and 
The Brothers Karamazov (1880), and Lalka (The Doll, 1890) by Boleslaw Prus. 
Through the analysis of social and psychological problems fiction had become a 
central feature of Europe's common culture. Authors adopted the convention of 
projecting their own most intimate observations into their fictional creations: 
Flaubert was reported to have said: 'Madame Bovary, c'est moi.' 



In the realm of music, as in literature, the nineteenth century assembled a 
vast and varied corpus of works which greatly extended the repertoire founded 
by the classical and early Romantic masters. Johannes Brahms (1833-97), born 
in Hamburg, must surely be rated the central figure. He combined an intellectual 
concern for Classical form with a Romantic passion for lyricism and emotional 
intensity, thereby earning the title of 'true heir to Bach and Beethoven'. The 
succession of more obviously Romantic orchestral composers began with Hector 
Berlioz (1803-69), whose 'Symphonie Fantastique' (1831) broke all the existing 
mles. Berlioz relied heavily on Romantic literature for inspiration. It was said: 
'Victor Hugo is a Romantic, but Berlioz is Romanticism itself.' The Romantic 
list continued with the languid Polish exile Frederic Chopin (1810-49), the 
supreme master of the piano; with the indefatigable Hungarian virtuoso Franz 
Liszt (1811-86); with Robert Schumann (1810-56) and Felix Mendelssohn- 
Bartholdy (1809-47). It contained most of the names who are often classed as 
leaders of national schools (see pp. 819-20); and it continued later in the century 
with the magnificent Russians Anton Rubinstein (1830-94), Peter Tchaikovsky 
(1840-93), and Sergei Rachmaninov (1873-1943); with the German Protestant, 
Max Bruch (1838-1920) and the Swiss Jewish Ernest Bloch (1880-1959); and 
with a strong contingent of Austro-German neo-Romantics led by Anton 
Bruckner (1824-96), Gustav Mahler (1860-1911), Richard Strauss (1864-1949), 
and the song-writer Hugo Wolf (1860-1903). Throughout the century, the 
French School produced a series of brilliant talents marked by great delicacy and 
originality, from Cesar Franck (1822-90) and Camille Saint-Saens (1835-1921) 
to Gabriel Faure (1845-1924), Claude Debussy (1862-1918), and Maurice 
Ravel (1875-1937). 

Grand opera, which married music to historical and literary drama, was a 
medium well suited to the Romantic style. Its success was driven by the rivalry 
of its three leading centres: the French opera, led by Charles Gounod (1818-93), 
Giacomo Meyerbeer (1791-1864), Georges Bizet (1838-75), and Jules Massenet 
(1842-1912); the German opera, launched by Mozart and Weber and 
culminating in the stupendous figure of Richard Wagner (1813-83); and the 
Italian opera, whose unequalled melodic traditions were promoted by Gioachino 
Rossini (1792-1868), Gaetano Donizetti (1797-1848), Giuseppe Verdi (1813- 
1901), and Giacomo Puccini (1855-1924). The genre variously known as opera 
comique, operetta, or musical comedy also thrived, especially in the Paris of 
Jacques Offenbach (1819-80), the Vienna of Johann Strauss II (1825-99) and 
Franz Lehar (1870-1948), and the London of Gilbert and Sullivan. (See 



Appendix III, p. 1278). 

The nineteenth century saw the rise of all the institutions which would turn 
the art of music into a major public enterprise-the conservatoires, the orchestral 
and choral societies, the purpose-built concert halls, the musical publishers, and 
the departments of musicology. 

Philosophy in the Romantic era came to be dominated by the powerful 
speculations of G. W. F. Hegel (1770-1831), Fichte's successor at Berlin. Hegel 
was particularly un-Romantic in many of his attitudes, and as a professional 
philosopher saw himself in the line of the rationalists. On a tour of the Bernese 
Oberland he was moved to remark: The spectacle of these eternally dead masses 
gave me nothing but the tedious idea, £5 ist so [That's what it's like].' On the 
other hand, the originality of many of his ideas attracted tremendous attention in 
a period of intellectual ferment; and he provided many distinguished pupils and 
critics, more rebellious than he, with a store of ammunition. Having brushed 
close to Napoleon in Jena in October 1806, on the day he finished his 
Phenomenology of Mind he wrote admiringly of the Emperor's 'World Soul'. 

Two of Hegel's favourite ideas were to prove specially fertile. One of these 
was the Dialectic, the productive clash of opposites. The other was the Geist or 
'Spirit', the essence of pure identity, which in his Philosophy of History he 
assigns to every political state and to each stage of developing civilization. The 
Dialectic, which Hegel confined to the realm of pure ideas, turned out to have 
many further applications which endowed the whole concept of progress with a 
dynamic and universal explanation. It seemed to make sense out of turmoil, to 
promise that good could emerge from conflict. The historical Spirit, on the other 
hand, which Hegel used for the glorification of the state, turned out to be a 
weapon in the hands of national movements struggling against the powers of the 
day. Hegel's views were intensely Germanocentric, and would seem to 
rationalize the Protestant and Prussian supremacy that was coming to the fore in 
his own lifetime. He praised war and military heroes, and gave the leading role 
in modern civilization to the Germans. 'The German spirit is the spirit of the 
new world. Its aim is the realization of absolute Truth as the unlimited self- 
determination of freedom.' Americans may or may not be flattered to learn that 
this po-faced purveyor of mystical metaphysics awarded America 'the final 
embodiment of the Absolute Idea, beyond which no further development would 
be possible'.- This may help explain the deep-seated Germanophile traditions in 
American academia. 


Scientific thought provided one of the strands which furthered the traditions 
of the Enlightenment rather than of Romanticism. Pushed to extremes in the 
work of Auguste Comte (1798-1857), however, it led not just to the branch of 
philosophy called 'positivism' but to a new pseudo-religion replete with its own 
rites, dogmas, and priesthood. Comte held that all knowledge passed through 
three successive stages of development, where it is systematized according to 
(respectively) theological, metaphysical, and 'positive' or scientific principles. 
This 'Law of the Three States', first expounded in the Systeme de politique 
positive (1842), provides the key to his elaborate classification of the sciences 
and to his outline of a new 'science of society' which he presented in the 
Philosophie positive (1850-4). The discipline of 'social physics' would permit 
the reordering of human society along scientific lines. The corps of 'social 
engineers' was armed with the slogan: 'Savoir pour prevoir, prevoir pour 
prevenir' (To know in order to foresee, to foresee in order to prevent). Comte 
must be regarded as one of the fathers of modern sociology, which he placed at 
the top of the hierarchy of sciences. At the same time, by insisting on the 
necessity of institutionalized spiritual power and by launching what was in effect 
a scientific Church, he ended up in the paradoxical position of turning science 
into the object of a mystical cult. In the eyes of one of his critics, T. H. Huxley, 
Comte's positivism was equivalent to 'Catholicism minus Christianity'. 

In this same period, science and technology forged ahead as never before. 
Although the nature of scientific discovery was perhaps less fundamental than 
that of Copernicus, Newton, or Einstein, whole new continents of knowledge 
were mapped out. Science moved into the forefront of public concern. The most 
distinguished names belong to the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine, and 
biology-above all, Faraday, Mendeleev, Pasteur, Mendel, Hertz, and Darwin. 
The list of major discoveries and inventions began to be counted not in the 
scores or hundreds but in thousands (see Appendix III, pp. 1272-3). With the 
exception of one or two Americans of genius, it was entirely dominated by 
Europeans. The Great Exhibition of 1851, which took place in London under the 
patronage of Prince Albert and whose profits were given over to the Science 
Museums and to the Imperial College of Science and Technology, attracted 
millions of visitors from all over the world, [elementa] [genes] 

The growing scientific challenge to traditional religious assumptions 
culminated in a major dispute over Darwin's Origin of Species (1859) and the 
associated Theory of Evolution. Christian fundamentalists, schooled in the literal 
truth of the Book of Genesis, where God created the world in six days and six 



nights, saw no way to reconcile a theory that mankind had slowly evolved over 
millions of generations. It was odd that this particular row between science and 
religion did not break out much earlier. After all, the pioneering treatise of 
palaeontology, on the antiquity of fossils, had been written by the Dane, Nils 
Steno, as long ago as 1669. The first scientific computation of the age of the 
earth-G. Buff on's epoques de la Nature, which arrived at the figure of c.75,000 
years-had been published in 1778; and the Nebular Hypothesis of Laplace, 
ascribing the origin of the universe to an expanding cloud of gas, had been in 
circulation since 1796. The French naturalist J.-B. Lamarck (1744-1829) had 
presented a theory of evolution based on the inheritance of acquired 
characteristics in 1809. Ever since Steno's time, scientific geologists had been 
locked in battle with the so-called 'diluvians', who ascribed all physical land 
forms to the effects of the Great Flood, [monkey] 


ELEMENTA 

On 1 March 1869 the Professor of Chemistry at St Petersburg University, 
Dmitri I. Mendeleev (1834-1907) was preparing to make a journey to Tver. 
Though preoccupied with the preparation of his textbook, Osnovy Khimii 
(Principles of Chemistry), he was also deeply involved in liberal schemes to 
apply science to everyday life in Russia, and he had accepted a commission 
to study peasant cheese-making methods. He had reached the point in his 
textbook where he was looking for a system to classify the chemical 
elements; and that day, he suddenly saw the benefit of ordering them in a 
table which listed them according both to their atomic weights and to 
common properties. 

Nine years earlier, Mendeleev had attended the first International 
Chemistry Congress at Karlsruhe, where the Italian, Stanislao Canizzaro, 
had drawn his attention to a list of elements arranged by atomic weight. 
Since then he had been playing a kind of mental patience, laying out the 
elements both by atomic values and by suits of properties. He now combined 
Canizzaro's list with his own typological grouping. The result was a 
primitive version of the Periodic Table, and a provisional formulation of the 
Periodic Law: 'Elements placed in accordance with the value of their atomic 




weights present a clear periodicity of properties.' That month he read a paper 
at the Russian Chemical Society on 'An Attempt at a System of Elements 
Based on Their Atomic Weight and Chemical Affinity'. It appeared in a 
German journal in March 1871. 

Prior to Mendeleev, the elements were only understood in piecemeal 
fashion. The ancients recognized ten real elements, but their thinking was 
confused by their parallel belief in the 'elemental forces' of earth, fire, air 
and water. Lavoisier knew 23 elements. Humphry Davy isolated sodium and 
potassium by electrolysis. By 1860, at Karlsruhe, Canizzaro had 60 elements 
on his list-exactly two-thirds of the 90 which occur in nature. 

Mendeleev's findings did not gain much immediate support. They were 
rejected by leading British and German chemists, including Bunsen, with 
whom he had once worked at Heidelberg. The break came in 1875, when a 
Frenchman identified a new element called 'gallium'. Mendeleev was able 
to show that this was one of the six undiscovered elements whose existence, 
atomic weights, and properties he had been able to predict. To the surprise of 
the profession, the Russian theoretician had proved himself in advance of the 
empirical research. International fame and fortune followed. In Russia, 
however, Mendeleev's liberal opinions caused friction. In 1880 he failed to 
gain full membership of the Imperial Academy; and in 1890 he was forced 
to resign from the university. In his later years he served as a consultant on 
everything from gunpowder and icebreakers to weights and measures, 
aeronautics, and the petroleum industry. 

Surprisingly, when Mendeleev learned of atomic structure, he felt the 
theory of radioactivity to be incompatible with his Periodic Law. In fact, it 
provided the ultimate confirmation of his great discovery. The electron count 

in the atom of each element is strictly related to its weight and properties, 
[ELEKTRON] 

When Mendeleev died, his students carried a copy of the Periodic Table 
over his coffin. By then, it had become the accepted basis for the chemical 
classification of matter, the meeting-point of modern chemistry and physics. 
In 1955, one of nineteen artificial radioactive elements, created by 
bombarding einsteinium-253 with helium ions, was named in his memory. It 
is Mendelevium (Me 101 ). 



Darwin's impact must be explained partly by the fact that scientific debates 
appealed by his time to a much wider audience, but mainly by the human aspect 
-the sensational news that all people were descended not from Adam but from 
the apes: from 'a hairy quadruped, furnished with a tail and pointed ears, 
probably arboreal in its habits'. Darwin had been collecting data on the 
formation of species ever since his voyage on HMS Beagle to South America 
and the Galapagos Islands in 1831-6; and his original flash of inspiration came 
after reading Malthus in 1838. More than twenty years passed before he was 
pushed into publishing his arguments in the Origin of Species, and more than 
thirty before he fully wrote them up in The Descent of Man and Selection in 
Relation to Sex (1871). Many particulars of Darwin's account of natural 
selection, otherwise known as 'the survival of the fittest', have been overtaken 
by later criticisms; but the main contention of evolutionism, that all living 
species of the plant and animal world have progressed through constant 
interchange with their environment and competition among themselves-quickly 
gained almost universal acceptance. With time, mainstream Christianity did not 
find difficulty in accepting human evolution as part of God's purpose. Social 
scientists adapted the evolutionary idea to numerous disciplines; and 'social 
Darwinism'-the notion that human affairs are a jungle in which only the fittest 
of nations, classes, or individuals will survive- was due to have a long career. 


MONKEY 

On Saturday, 30 June 1860, seven hundred people crammed into an Oxford 
lecture room for a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement 
of Science. In theory, they had come to hear a paper by an American scholar, 
Dr Draper, on The Intellectual Development of Europe considered with 
reference to the views of Mr Darwin'. In fact they had come to watch a 
contest between the paper's two main discussants. On one side sat Samuel 
Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford, a fierce adversary of the Evolution Theory, 
known as 'Soapy Sam'. On the other side, in Darwin's absence, sat Professor 
T. H. Huxley, palaeontologist, about to gain the label of 'Darwin's Bulldog'. 

No one remembered Dr Draper's paper. But Bishop Wilberforce, who 
took the stand in jovial mood, ended his remarks by asking whether Mr 




Huxley 'claimed his descent from a monkey through his grandfather or his 
grandmother?' Huxley kept cool, and explained that Darwin's theory was 
much more than a hypothesis. 'I would not be ashamed to have a monkey as 
an ancestor,' he concluded, 'but I would be ashamed to be connected with a 
man who used great gifts to obscure the truth.' 1 A woman fainted amidst the 
uproar. 

The meeting was a critical moment in the popular reception of modern 
science. It took place only one year after the publication of the Origin of 
Species, and two years after Darwin had read a joint paper 'On the Tendency 
of Species to Form Varieties: and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and 
Species by Natural Means of Selection'. Four years later, at a return match in 
the Sheldonian Theatre, Benjamin Disraeli could not resist a jibe in the style 
of 'Soapy Sam'. 'The question is this;' he said, 'Is Man an ape or an angel? 
My Lord, I am on the side of the angels!' 

The subsequent career of Evolutionism is well-trodden history. One line 
of development fostered by Darwin himself came to be known as 'Social 
Darwinism'. It preached the ominous proposition not just that the fittest had 
survived but also that the fittest alone had a right to survive. Another line 
was concerned with the practical science of 'improving racial standards', i.e. 
of human breeding. This was pioneered by a series of English scholars 
headed by Sir Francis Galton (1822-1911), Professor at University College 
London, and came to be known as eugenics. Its later advocates included 
Gabon's student and biographer, Karl Pearson (1857-1936), a statistician 
and Marxist, who founded a theory of 'social imperialism', and H. S. 
Chamberlain who publicized their ideas in Germany. 

Francis Galton was responsible for some of the most influential research 
and pseudo-research of the age. His Art of Travel (1855) followed a 
pioneering expedition into the interior of South-West Africa, setting the 
fashion for African exploration. His Meteorographica (1863) launched the 
modern science of meteorology. As an early psychologist, he conducted the 
first studies on the behaviour of twins, and set up the world's first mental test 
centre. As an enthusiast for eugenics, he wrote a series of volumes on 
Gregariousness in Cattle and Men (1871), on Inquiries into Human Faculty 
(1883), and on Natural Inheritance (1889). Before that, he completed an 
extremely popular study of Hereditary Genius: its Laws and Consequences 
(1869). Applying statistical methods to the genealogies of a wide range of 



achievers from judges to wrestlers, he tried to show that 'talent and genius, 
and an inclination to moral traits, tend to run in families'. In a final section, 
he analysed 'The Comparative Worth of Different Races'. He graded the 
races on a scale from A to I, concluding that the ancient Greeks were 'the 
ablest race of which history bears record': that African negroes, despite 
outstanding individuals, could never attain the average grade of Anglo- 
Saxons: and that Australian aborigines were one grade beneath the negroes. 2 
Darwin said that he had never read anything 'more original or interesting'; 
but he rejected eugenic science as 'Utopian'. At Darwin's funeral in 
Westminster Abbey, Galton publicly called for the Abbey's Creation 
Window to be replaced by something more suited to Evolution. 3 The point 
is: Galton, the advocate of 'hereditary genius', was Darwin's cousin. 4 


Indeed, the general conviction that scientific methods could and should be 
applied to the study of human as well as natural phenomena represented one of 
the characteristic changes of the age. Hence, in addition to economics and 
ethnography there appeared sociology, anthropology, human geography, political 
science, and eventually psychology and psychiatry. As the scope of the physical 
and social sciences expanded, the preserve of pure philosophy contracted until it 
was left with a handful of traditional fields-epistemology, logic, ethics, 
aesthetics, and political theory. 

Religion was resurgent. It found expression in a rich corpus of theological 
writing, in the fervour of the masses, in the strengthening of Church dogma and 
organization. The new climate was formed partly in revulsion against the 
excesses of the revolutionary era and partly through the termination of many 
earlier forms of religious discrimination. The Enlightenment was reaching its 
term, but not before the principle of religious toleration was accepted. 
Discriminatory laws against Catholics dating from the seventeenth century were 
removed in most Protestant states. Protestants gained equivalent rights in most 
Catholic states. Judaism was readmitted in many places whence it had been 
excluded since medieval times. In Prussia, for example, a new national Church 
was created in 1817 through a merger of Lutheran and Calvinist elements; the 
Catholic Church was fully established by the Constitution of 1850. In Austria- 
Hungary, full religious toleration was guaranteed as part of the Ausgleich of 




1867. In Great Britain, Roman Catholics were largely emancipated by Act of 
Parliament in 1829, and the Jews in 1888; though both continued to be excluded 
from the monarchy. In the Netherlands, similar measures were completed in 
1853. In France, the Napoleonic Concordat remained in force until 1905, despite 
tension between Catholics and Republicans. Extreme French rationalists 
professed a zealotry of their own: at Limoges they staged a festival of 
mathematics to compete with the Feast of the Assumption. 

In Russia, in contrast, the Orthodox establishment enforced severe 
restrictions on religious diversity. Although the Protestants of the ex-Swedish 
provinces of the Baltic, the native Christians of the Caucasus, and the Muslims 
of Central Asia enjoyed a large measure of autonomy, the Jews, Roman 
Catholics, and Uniates of the ex-Polish provinces were subject to state control, 
harassment, and discrimination. The Jews were legally required to reside in the 
so-called Pale of Settlement (see Appendix III, p. 1311), beyond which they 
could only live by special licence. The Roman Catholic Church was run via the 
so-called Holy Synod, and was deprived of all direct contact with the Vatican. St 
Petersburg refused all official ties with Rome until it succeeded in arranging the 
Concordat of 1849 on its own terms. The Uniates were forcibly converted to 
Orthodoxy, in the Empire in 1839 and in the ex-Congress Kingdom of Poland in 
1875. 

Theological debate was stimulated across Europe by three separate 
developments A -by the interchange of Protestant and Catholic viewpoints that 
were now emerging from their isolation cages, by the profound interest of the 
Romantic period in exotic religions, especially Buddhism and Hinduism, and by 
the growth of scientific attitudes. In the course of the century, many theologians 
acquired an interdenominational and an international reputation. These included 
the Silesian Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768-1834), a Calvinist and professor at 
Berlin, the radical Breton abbe Hugues Lamennais (1782-1854), the Bavarian 
Catholic J. J. Ignaz von Dollinger (1799-1890), Rector at Munich, the Anglican 
convert to Roman Catholicism, John Henry-Newman (1801-90), and the gloomy 
Dane Soren Kierkegaard (1813-55), whose works were not understood till 
decades after his death. 

Schleiermacher, who was influential in the Prussian Union of Churches, 
brought theological rigour to an integrated view of human art and culture. His 
Uber die Religion (1799) taught the Romantic generation that their outward 
contempt belied profound sympathies; his major work, Der Christliche Glaube 



(1821-2), is the standard summary of Protestant dogmatics. His Kurze 
Darstellung (1811) or 'Brief Outline of Theology' was still being cited in 1989 
as the best introduction to the subject.- 

The Abbe Lamennais set out to reconcile the Church to those parts of the 
revolutionary tradition which he judged to be compatible with Christianity. 
Under the device of 'Dieu et Liberte', he gradually pushed Rome to disown him. 
Scandalized by the outcome of the Revolution of 1830, by the Vatican's betrayal 
of Catholic Poland, and by the Church's disinterest in social justice, he became a 
scourge of the Establishment. Faith was not to be confused with loyalty to the 
Church, nor patriotism with loyalty to the state. The titles of his books speak for 
themselves- Paroles d'un croyant (1833), Les Affaires de Rome (1836), Le 
Livre du peuple (1837), UEsclavage moderne (1840). Lamennais's work has had 
a profound impact on the dissident tendency within European Catholicism, 
where a critical mind was no obstacle to profound belief. 

Dollinger led the resistance to the doctrine of papal infallibility (see below). 
His Der Papst und die Konzil (1869) was described as The severest attack on the 
Holy See in a thousand years'. Newman, sometime Vicar of the University 
Church of St Mary the Virgin in Oxford, is particularly interesting, since his 
career illustrates the interaction between Protestants and Catholics. He came to 
prominence in the 1830s as a leader of the Tractarian or Oxford Movement 
within the Anglican Church. The polemical series of Tracts for the Times', 
which he prepared in the company of Edward Pusey (1800-82) and John Keble 
(1792-1866), sought to reconcile the Anglican and the Roman Catholic 
traditions. But attacks on his Tract 90 (1841), which linked the Thirty-Nine 
Articles with the views of the early Church Fathers, destroyed his faith in 
Anglicanism and provoked his resignation. His Apologia pro Vita Sua (1864) 
examines his spiritual struggle with great candour. As he records, his entry into 
the Catholic fold occasioned much bleating. He later clashed with his fellow 
convert and cardinal, H. E. Manning (1808-92), on the issue of papal 
infallibility; but he did not push his dissent to the point of disobedience. 

Kierkegaard's writings were aimed first at the philosophy of Hegel and 
secondly at the cosy practices of the Church of Denmark; but they penetrated far 
beyond, into intellectual regions otherwise unexplored. His Fear and Trembling 
(1843), The Concept of Dread (1844) and Sickness unto Death (1849) enter and 
explore the psychology of the unconscious. His Unscientific Postscript (1846) is 
often taken as the lead text of existentialism. All his works constitute a 


devastating offensive against rationalism. Subjectivity, according to 
Kierkegaard, is truth. 'The history of Christendom', he wrote, 'is the history of 
the subtle disregarding of Christianity.' In a passage strangely prescient of the 
tragedy of the Titanic, he once likened Europeans to the passengers of a great 
ship, passing the night in revels as they sailed towards the iceberg of doom. 

In the course of these debates, theology and biblical scholarship began to 
adopt many of the methods and values of literary and historical criticism. The 
most daring foray in this direction, The Life of Jesus (1863) by Ernest Renan 
(1823-92), led to its author's suspension from the College de France. Even so, 
'modernism' continued to make headway, especially when solemnly denounced 
by the hierarchy. 

Religious fervour is not easily measured; but there is no doubt that the 
Christian faith now aroused greater passions among greater numbers of people 
than in the previous century. The general trend towards literacy strengthened 
religious as well as secular education; and missionary campaigns were targeted 
as much on the poor and lapsed souls of the new industrial towns as the pagans 
of distant continents. Especially in the Protestant countries, the Churches 
provided a measure of social leadership and social discipline that was previously 
unknown. The revivalist movements such as German Pietism or English 
Methodism now gripped whole districts, whole sections of society. In other 
countries, as in Ireland or parts of Poland, popular piety became associated with 
national resistance. Everywhere there occurred a great outpouring of religious 
art, often inspired and infused by medieval models. It found expression in the 
wave of Gothic church-building, in hymn-writing, in religious-minded art 
movements such as the Pre-Raphaelites in England or the Nazarenes in 
Germany, and in a great body of Church music. According to C. F. Schinkel 
(1781-1841), the Neo-Gothic architect, 'Art itself is Religion'. Composers from 
Berlioz to Franck worked to meet the demands for ever new settings of the 
Mass, [missa] 

The Roman Catholic Church was by no means immune from the changes, 
though its reluctance to move with the times was manifest. The Catholic 
heartlands in Spain, Italy, Austria, Poland, and southern Germany were less 
immediately affected by industrialization and modernization. What is more, the 
higher echelons of the Catholic hierarchy had been shocked to the roots by the 
events of the revolutionary era, and were frozen into an ultra-conservative stance 
from which they did not begin to emerge until the 1960s. The Vatican was 



further frightened by the long rearguard action that was fought in Italy over the 
Papal States, which were suppressed in 1870. Ultramontanism returned to 
fashion, not least under pressure from the embattled French bishops and from the 
Jesuit Order, restored in 1814. [Bernadette] 

Under Pius IX (r. 1846-78), whom Metternich had initially mistaken for a 
liberal, dogmas were adopted that exceeded the claims of the most assertive 
medieval Popes. In 1854 the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception of the 
Virgin was promulgated. In 1864 the Encyclical Quanta Cura asserted the 
Church's supremacy over all forms of civil authority, whilst the Syllabus 
expounded an extraordinary list of 'modern errors' including everything from 
civil marriage to religious toleration. In 1870, by the doctrinal constitution 
Pastor Aeternus passed by the General Vatican Council, the dogma of papal 
infallibility was introduced in matters of faith and morals. These positions were 
so extreme that the Papacy lost much respect both within and without the 
Church. A major conflict, the Kulturkampf, was provoked in Germany, and a 
number of Swiss, German, and Dutch clerics broke away to form the Old 
Catholic Church. Pius IX died in the Vatican Palace, stripped of all temporal 
powers, protesting he was 'a moral prisoner'. His loyal servants the Jesuits were 
expelled from Germany in 1872, from France in 1880. [syllabus] 

Under Leo XIII (r. 1878-1903), the 'Pope of Peace', the Church moved 
much closer to modern thinking on political and especially social issues. The 
Encyclical Libertas (1888) sought to affirm the positive aspects of liberalism, 
democracy, and freedom of conscience. Another, Rerum Novarum (1891), put 
the Church on the side of social justice, condemning the excesses of unrestrained 
capitalism and exhorting all states to promote the welfare of all their citizens. 
Under Pius X (r. 1903-14), however, the Encyclical Pascendi Dominici Gregis 
(1907) flatly denounced modernism as 'the resume of all heresies', and seemed 
to raise the reactionary banner once again. 


BERNADETTE 


Between 11 February and 16 July 1858, in a grotto near the town of 
Lourdes in Bigorre, a malnourished, asthmatic waif, Marie-Bernarde 
Soubirous, saw a series of eighteen remarkable apparitions. She heard a 




rushing wind, then saw a beautiful young girl in a white dress and a blue 
sash, with golden roses at her feet. The apparition told Bernadette to pray, to 
be penitent, to build a chapel, and to drink of the fountain. On one occasion, 
it announced, in patois, that it was immaculada concepciou, 'the Immaculate 
Conception. 5 It let itself be sprinkled with holy water as proof against the 
Devil; and it showed itself capable of punishment and reward. Townspeople 
who blasphemed about it fell sick. Others who trampled the roses near the 
grotto found their property damaged. The water from the fountain proved to 
have healing powers. 

At first, neither the civil nor the ecclesiastical authorities were 
impressed. They interrogated Bernadette at length, creating a large corpus of 
evidence; and they placed a barrier round the grotto. When they could 
restrain neither the locals nor the stream of visitors, they removed Bernadette 
to a convent at Nevers. In due course, they decided to join what they could 
not beat, building a huge basilica to receive the pilgrims, and a Catholic 
medical centre to test the claims of miraculous cures. Lourdes was to 
become the largest centre of Christian faith-healing in Europe. 1 

In Church History, St Bernadette (1844-79) belongs to the large 
company of Marian visionaries and Catholic devotionalists who upheld 
traditional religion against advancing secularism. Together with the 
consumptive St Therese Martin (1873-97), 'the Little Flower of Lisieux', 
whose autobiographical History of a Soul became a sensational best-seller, 
she helped to demonstrate the sanctity of the suffering believer. As such she 
was recruited for the French Church's struggle against its foes. She was 
canonized in 1933, eight years after St Therese. 

In another respect, the case of Bernadette Soubirous suggests that the age 
of social modernization in which she lived was not quite so simple as 
conventionally portrayed. Historians have described the process whereby 
peasants were being steadily changed by state schooling and military service 
into uniform Frenchmen. 2 But the events of 1858 show other factors at work. 
Everyone in Lourdes, even the bishop, spoke patois. No one suggested that 
Bernadette was mad, or a devil-worshipper. She described no ordinary 
Madonna, and no Christ-child. She belonged to a timeless community, where 
water was venerated and where the rituals of washing, whether of clothes or 
of the dead and the newborn, was strictly woman's work. She lived in a 
region, where, though the bishop had been repairing Marian shrines, the 



caves and grottos of the Pyrenean wilderness were still held to be the haunt 
of fairies. She even called the apparition petito demoisella -a phrase 
sometimes used for 'fairy'. Her barefoot, lice-ridden body, her stubborn 
consistency, and, above all, the long hours on her knees in positions of 
ecstasy, proved very convincing. It has been suggested that her body 
language was acting as 'a non-verbal vehicle for social memory'. 3 
Bernadette was conveying something which her neighbours took to be 
authentic. 


The Orthodox world saw changes principally in the sphere of national 
politics. As Ottoman power receded in the Balkans, separate autocephalous 
Churches were established in Greece, Serbia, Romania, Montenegro, and 
Bulgaria, each subject to its own synod or Patriarch. They provided an important 
focus for the developing identity of the Balkan nations. The Ecumenical 
Patriarchs of Constantinople correspondingly lost much of their previous 
prestige and influence. Repeatedly deposed by the Porte, they were particularly 
threatened by the pretensions of the Russian Orthodox Church, which 
increasingly claimed to exercise protection and patronage over all the Sultan's 
Orthodox subjects. The divisions between Christians proved hard to heal: there 
was no general wish for unity or intercommunion. The Russian Orthodox 
showed a certain interest in the Old Catholics; and at the Tsar's coronation in 
1895 the first of a series of contacts were made with the Church of England. Yet 
the early stirrings of ecumenism were necessarily confined to the Protestant 
world. The Church Union of 1817 in Prussia brought Calvinists and Lutherans 
together. The British and Foreign Bible Society (1804), the YMCA (1844), and 
the YWCA (1855) were pioneering examples of interdenominational and 
international co-operation. Generally speaking, the Roman Catholic hierarchy 
stood aloof, until the scandal of competing missionary organizations in Africa 
and Asia eventually prompted action. The World Missionary Conference held in 
Edinburgh in 1910 gave rise to the International Missionary Council, one of two 
acknowledged sources of the subsequent ecumenical movement. 


Politics in the nineteenth century centred on the fate of the monarchies whose 
supremacy was restored but then gradually undermined by the three great 
movements of the age-Liberalism, Nationalism, and Socialism. Generally 




speaking, despite some notable casualties, the monarchies survived intact. There 
were more ruling heads on sacred thrones in 1914 than a hundred years earlier. 
But they only survived by profoundly modifying the nature of the bond between 
rulers and ruled. 


SYLLABUS 

On 8 December 1864 Pope Pius IX published the encyclical Quanta cura 
together with a 'Syllabus of the Most Important Errors of our Time'. The 
documents had been in the Vatican pipeline for more than fifteen years, and 
had been revised several times. They had already sparked a furore in 1862 
when an anticlerical journal in Turin, // Mediatore, had published a selection 
of their leaked contents. 

The Syllabus is divided into ten thematic sections, each containing 
several clauses. Since the purpose is to expose errors, the Roman Church's 
position on any particular issue can be reached by prefacing the relevant 
clause with the words 'It is not true that': 

Atheism and Absolute Rationalism 

1. God does not exist. 

2. Divine revelation can be used to oppose all science or philosophical 
speculation. 

On Moderate Rationalism 

Indifferentism 

15. All religions and religious denominations are equal. 

On Political Societies 

18. All socialist, communist, secret, bible-reading, and clerico-liberal 
societies are permitted. 

The Rights of the Church 

24. The Church has no temporal power. 

26. The Church can be denied the right to hold property. 

28. Bishops may only promulgate apostolic letters by governmental 




consent. 

30. The Church's rights derive from Civil Law alone. 

32. The clergy's exemption from military service may be rescinded. 

33. The Church may be denied the right to teach sacred doctrine. 

37. National churches may be established free of papal control. 

The Rights of the State 

39. The State is the sole fount of social authority. 

43. The State may rescind concordats unilaterally. 

44. Civil Law is superior to Canon Law. 

45. The State's right to determine educational policy is absolute. 

46. The State may exercise ultimate control over seminaries. 

49. The State may deny the Hierarchy free communication with Rome. 

50. Lay bodies have the sole right to appoint or to depose bishops. 

54. Kings and princes may be exempted from the laws of the Church. 

55. The separation of Church and State is necessary. 

Ethics 

56. Human laws need not conform to natural or to divine law. 

58. Only powers rooted in matter are to be acknowledged. 

63. It is permissible to rebel against legitimate princes. 

Christian Matrimony 

66. Matrimony is not sacramental in nature. 

67. The matrimonial bond is dissoluble, and hence divorce sensu 
stricto can be permitted by the State. 

68. The State alone may define the impediments to matrimony. 

The Pontiff's Temporal Powers 

75. Faithful Catholics may dispute the Pontiff's temporal or spiritual 
powers. 

76. The Church would benefit by relinquishing its temporal powers. 

Liberalism 

77. It is no longer expedient that Catholicism be the sole denomination. 

78. Immigrants to Catholic countries should be entitled to the public 



exercise of all religions. 

80. The Roman Pontiff can and should reconcile himself and 
harmonize with 'progress', 'liberalism', and 'modern civilization'. 1 

The origins of the Syllabus lay in the demands of Italian bishops for 
guidance in the maelstrom of debate surrounding the creation of the 
Kingdom of Italy. The Papacy was an active participant in the political 
struggle, and many of the clauses, though presented in universal terms, were 
dictated by very specific local conditions. This grave failing led to many 
misunderstandings. For example, the apparently blanket condemnation of all 
'clerico-liberal' societies in Clause 18 was taken to be an attack on all 
enlightened clerics from Montalembert onwards. Its intention had merely 
been to curb that part of the clergy in Piedmont which was supporting 
government plans to dissolve the monasteries. 

Reading the text carefully, it is clear that on the majority of issues the 
Vatican was simply reserving its position. By saying 'It is not true that the 
Pontiff should harmonize with modern civilization', the Syllabus was only 
stating the obvious: that the Church was guided by the timeless principles of 
its religion, and would not bow to fashionable slogans. 

But the impression created was rather different. Several of the key 
clauses were lamentably drafted, and should not have been included. Once 
the double negatives had been bandied around in a hostile press, many 
people were convinced that the Roman Catholic Church was implacably 
opposed to all toleration, to all rational thought, to all forms of matrimonial 
separation, to all national self-determination, and to all forms of social 
charity. 

On the political front, it is extraordinary in retrospect that the Vatican's 
lawyers could have lumped all socialists, communists, secret societies, 
independent bible-readers, and liberal clerics into the same ring of Hell. But 
that was a sign of the times. Other highly intelligent conservatives elsewhere 
in Europe thought in the same way. Fyodor Dostoevsky, arguably the 
greatest mind of the age, might have approved of Clause 18 as far as it went. 
Except, from his peculiarly Russian standpoint, he would have been tempted 
to add 'and all Roman Catholics'. 2 



Liberalism developed along two parallel tracks, the political and the economic. 
Political liberalism focused on the essential concept of government by consent. It 
took its name from the liberales of Spain, who drew up their Constitution of 
1812 in opposition to the arbitrary powers of the Spanish monarchy, but it had its 
roots much further back, in the political theories of the Enlightenment and 
beyond. Indeed, for much of its early history it was indistinguishable from the 
growth of limited government. Its first lasting success may be seen in the 
American Revolution, though it drew heavily on the experiences of British 
parliamentarian-ism and on the first, constitutional phase of the Revolution in 
France. In its most thoroughgoing form it embraced republicanism, though most 
liberals welcomed a popular, limited, and fair-minded monarch as a factor 
encouraging stability. Its advocates stressed above all the rule of law, individual 
liberty, constitutional procedures, religious toleration and the universal rights of 
man. They opposed the inbuilt prerogatives, wherever they survived, of Crown, 
Church, or aristocracy. Nineteenth-century liberals also gave great weight to 
property, which they saw as the principal source of responsible judgement and 
solid citizenship. As a result, whilst taking the lead in clipping the wings of 
absolutism and in laying the foundations of modern democracy, they were not 
prepared to envisage radical schemes for universal suffrage or for egalitarianism. 

Economic liberalism focused on the concept of free trade, and on the 
associated doctrine of laissez-faire, which opposed the habit of governments to 
regulate economic life through protectionist tariffs. It stressed the right of men of 
property to engage in commercial and industrial activities without undue 
restraint. Its energies were directed on the one hand to dismantling the economic 
barriers which had proliferated both within and between countries and on the 
other to battling against all forms of collectivist organization, from the ancient 
guild to the new trade unions. 

Liberalism is often categorized as the ideology of the new middle classes; 
and it certainly appealed to that wide and expanding social constituency which 
lay between the old privileged nobility and the propertyless industrial masses. 
Yet its appeal cannot be so closely confined. It also reached to a wide variety of 
interests that were not essentially social or economic in their motivation-to the 
widespread Burschenschaften or student associations of the 1820s, to 
freemasonry, to cultural dissidents, to educational and prison reforms, to 
aristocratic British Whigs and Polish magnates, even to groups such as dissident 
army officers in Russia, the 'Decembrists', who in 1825 dared to plot against the 
evils of autocracy. 



Given England's precocious development, it is not surprising to find the most 
cogent exposes of liberalism in English writing. In economics, the Principles of 
Political Economy (1817) of David Ricardo (1771-1823) completed the work of 
the classical economists started by Adam Smith. Ricardo's disciples took 
practical action in the activities of the Anti-Corn Law League and in the 
campaigns of the Manchester School, the advocates of free trade headed by 
Richard Cobden (1804-65) and John Bright (1811-89). In political philosophy, 
the works of John Stuart Mill (1806-73) stand as the supreme monument to a 
tolerant and balanced brand of liberalism, where some of the starker principles 
of earlier advocates were refined and modified in the light of recent debates and 
experience. Mill defends laissez-faire economics, for example, but only if the 
power of capitalist employers is matched by the rights of employees' trade 
unions. He endorses the 'greatest happiness' principle of the Utilitarians-as 
proclaimed by his philosopher father, James Mill (1773-1836)-but only if 
happiness is not confused with pleasure. In his essay On Liberty (1859) he 
produced the standard manifesto of individual human rights, which should only 
be restricted where they impinge on the rights of others. 'The sole end where 
mankind is warranted ... in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their 
number', he wrote, 'is self-protection.' In The Subjection of Women (1869) he 
made the clearest of arguments for the feminist cause, maintaining that there is 
nothing in the many differences between men and women that would justify 
their possession of different rights. 

The central political drama over liberalism, however, was bound to be played 
out in France, the home of the frustrated Revolution and the scene of the most 
developed, honed, and diametrically opposed political opinions. French politics 
were characterized not merely by the entrenched positions of conservative 
Catholic monarchists and of radical anticlerical republicans. They were 
complicated by a number of paradoxical figures, such as the ex-Jacobin 
republican and 'Citizen-King', Louis-Philippe (r. 1830-48), or the would-be 
liberal and revolutionary turned Emperor, Louis-Napoleon (Napoleon III, r. 
1848-70). 

The result was a see-saw history of alternating conservative and liberal 
regimes interspersed with a series of violent revolutionary outbreaks. The 
Bourbon Restoration of Louis XVIII (r. 1815-24) and Charles X (r. 1824-30) 
was overthrown by the July Revolution of 1830. The July Monarchy of Louis- 
Philippe was overthrown by the Revolution of 23 February 1848. The short-lived 
Second Republic was overthrown by its original beneficiary, who proceeded to 



proclaim himself Emperor. The Second Empire (1851-70) was overthrown 
amidst the humiliation of the Franco-Prussian War, and the violence of the Paris 
Commune. The Third Republic, inaugurated in 1870, survived for 70 years; but 
it was marked by the extreme instability of its governments, by the extreme 
liveliness and futility of its public debates, and by the extreme animosity of the 
opposing camps. The notorious affair of Captain Dreyfus which gripped France 
between 1894 and 1906 was proof that the liberal and anti-liberal passions of the 
French had still not found a modus vivendi. 

Similar swings of violent fortune prevailed in Spain, which served as a sort 
of laboratory of liberalism. An unbridgeable gulf yawned between the exaltados 
or 'extreme radicals' and the apostolicos, the extreme, Church-backed 
monarchists. From 1829 many of the latter supported the claims of the royal 
pretender, Don Carlos (d. 1855) and his heirs, who commanded a loyal following 
among the Basques and Catalans. A succession of impoverished and debauched 
monarchs- Ferdinand VII (r. 1814-43), Isabella (r. 1840(3)-68), Alfonso XII (r. 
1874-85)- bent to every breeze that blew. As a result, liberal constitutions were 
annulled as frequently as they were introduced-in 1812, 1820, 1837, 1852, 
1855, 1869, 1876. Clerical intrigues, excesses, and civil war were the order of 
the day. After the brief reign of Amadeo, Duke of Aosta (r. 1870-3), a brief 
republic existed. After 1876, under Alfonso XIII (r. 1885-1931), the liberal 
centre was at last strong enough to maintain a constitutional monarchy until the 
1920s, [PRADO] 

Portugal endured an 80-year constitutional struggle that ended with the 
abolition of the monarchy. The constitutional Charter was granted in 1826, soon 
after Brazil had established its independence, and King Pedro had decided to 
stay on as Emperor of Brazil. But all manner of stratagems were used to obstruct 
the Charter's implementation. Until 1853 the absolutist court of Maria II and her 
two sons held sway. Under Carlos (r. 1889-1908), the rotativos or 'revolving 
ministries' of the Progressive and Regenerator Parties dominated the Cortes, and 
combined to exclude the growing body of republican sentiment. The reign 
culminated in a brief royal dictatorship, and in the assassination of the King and 
Crown Prince. The last King of Portugal, Manuel II (r. 1908-10), retired to 
England when the armed forces backed the revolution of 5 October 1910 and 
declared a Republic. 

Each of France's 'Revolutions' had repercussions right across Europe. In 
1830 the 'July days' in Paris sparked the August rising in Bmssels, and the 



November rising in Warsaw (see below). In Paris, the sight of Lafayette at the 
head of the rebels led to the abdication of the reactionary Charles X and his parti 
pretre, and the election of Louis-Philippe by the Chamber of Deputies. In 
Brussels, the seizure of the Hotel de Ville and the failure of the Dutch army to 
restore order led to the election of Louis-Philippe's son, the Due de Nemours, as 
prospective King of the Belgians. The Belgian provinces of the United Kingdom 
of the Netherlands had resented their subordination to Dutch interests ever since 
1815. Belgian independence was acceptable to the Powers, who approved the 
creation of a model constitutional monarchy. But it was Leopold I of Saxe- 
Coburg (r. 1831-65) who emerged as King, not the Due de Nemours, [gotha] 

In February 1848 the head of revolutionary steam was much stronger than in 
1830, and the rash of explosions spread to all the major states except for Britain 
and Russia. In this case trouble was already afoot in Switzerland from 1845, in 
the Republic of Cracow from 1846, and in Sicily from 1847. The overthrow of 
Louis-Philippe sent the signal which set almost all the major cities of Germany, 
Italy, Austria, and Hungary ablaze. The events of 1848-9 have been termed 'the 
Revolution of the Intellectuals', mainly on the strength of the weighty debates in 
the Vorparlament in Frankfurt and in the Slav Congress in Prague, and of the 
epoch-making publication of the Communist Manifesto (see below). In reality, it 
was a time when bloody actions spoke much louder than mere words. It was not 
only intellectuals who manned the barricades, even though poets such as 
Lamartine, Mickiewicz, or Sandor Petofi plunged into the fray. Lamartine served 
as foreign minister in France's initial revolutionary government. Mickiewicz 
raised a legion of Polish exiles to fight for the Roman Republic. Petofi died in a 
battle against the Austrians. In Paris, over 10,000 people died during the 'June 
days' when General Cavaignac's troops crushed the resistance of the workers, 
whose short-lived national workshops had been abolished. In Berlin and 
elsewhere, the monarchs tended to fire first and to discuss constitutions 
afterwards. In Italy, Sardinia launched a 'Guerra Santa' against Austrian rule in 
Lombardy. In Hungary, where the Habsburgs were dethroned and Kossuth 
proclaimed regent and dictator, two Russian armies and a year-long campaign 
were required to effect the restoration. In Italy, French, Austrian, and Neapolitan 
troops had to be called in to destroy the self-proclaimed Republics in Rome and 
Venice. 

In the immediate reckoning, therefore, 1848 provoked a series of liberal 
disasters. Only one monarchy was toppled, and that in France, where President 
Louis-Napoleon moved swiftly to undermine the republican institutions that had 



brought him to power. Within three years the French, who had thrown out their 
King, were saddled once more with an authoritarian Emperor. Not one of 
Europe's new republics survived. Metternich, the symbol of the previous era, 
returned to Vienna from exile in London. New repressions, under new leaders, 
returned with him. 

Yet before long 1848 came to be seen as a watershed in Europe's affairs. The 
reactionary regimes had triumphed, but only at such heavy cost that they could 
not bear a repeat performance. Constitutions that had been granted, imposed, and 
in some cases withdrawn were gradually reintroduced or widened. If the violent 
methods of the revolutionaries were rejected, the political and social reforms 
which they demanded were now given serious consideration. With some delay, 
monarchs realized that wise concessions to popular demands were preferable to 
endless repression. The basic liberal principle of government by consent steadily 
gained widespread acceptance. One by one over the next two decades, the 
victors of 1848 abandoned their frozen postures. National and constitutional 
aspirations came again to the fore. Even the autocratic empires of the East began 
to bend. In 1855, with the accession of Alexander II (r. 1855-81), the Romanovs 
set in motion a season of liberalization a la russe. In 1867, through the Ausgleich 
or 'Equalization Agreement', the Habsburgs finally addressed the long-standing 
desires of the Hungarians, setting up the dual Austro-Hungarian monarchy, 
Kaiserliche und Konigliche, with which they had to live for the rest of their 
reigning days. 

Economic liberalism, of course, was not necessarily tied to its political 
counterpart. The German Zollverein or Customs Union, for example, was 
initiated by Frederick-William III of Prussia in 1818, at a time when political 
liberalism was in sharp retreat. Originally intended for Prussian territories alone, 
it was steadily extended to all the states of the German confederation except 
Austria. By banning all internal tariffs, it created a growing zone of free trade 
within which Germany's infant industries could flourish. In 1828 two rival 
Customs Unions came into being, one based on Bavaria and Wurttemberg, the 
other on Saxony; but within four years these were absorbed. In 1852 Austria 
tried to break out of its isolation by proposing a customs union for the whole of 
Central Europe and northern Italy. But the Prussians resisted. The accession of 
Hanover in 1854 made the Prussian victory complete, except for the recalcitrant 
cities of Bremen and Hamburg. The foundations of a united German economy, 
excluding Austria, had been laid at a juncture when prospects for political 
unification still seemed remote. 



PRADO 


Spain's Royal Art Museum was opened to the public on Prado Avenue in 
Madrid on 19 November 1819. It owed its existence to the enthusiasm of 
King Ferdinand VII, recently restored to his throne, and to his second queen, 
Isabella de Braganza. It was managed by its first director, the Prince of 
Anglona, under the Council of Grandees. It was housed behind the 
Corinthian facades of a new building designed thirty years earlier by the 
architect Don Juan Villanueva as a museum of natural history. The initial 
exhibition displayed 311 paintings. It did not include the large number of 
masterpieces which had been captured by the Duke of Wellington six years 
earlier in the baggage of Joseph Bonaparte, but not returned. 

The Museum's first catalogue was published in 1823 in French, since the 
Duke of Angouleme, and the latest French army of occupation, The sons of 
St Louis', had recently entered Spain to rescue the King from his subjects. It 
was renamed the National Museum in 1838, after merger with the Trinidad 
Collection taken from suppressed monasteries. It assumed the name Prado 
Museum in 1873, following the liberal revolt. It was closed during the 
Spanish Civil War of 1936-9, when many of its treasures were removed and 
exhibited in Geneva. 

Spain's royal art collection goes back to John II of Castile (d. 1445), who 
is known to have bought pictures by Roger Van der Weyden. Its greatest 
benefactors were Charles V and Philip II, the patrons of Titian: Philip IV, 
who employed Velazquez: and Charles III, who in 1774 sequestered the 
entire property of the Jesuits. Despite severe losses through fire and the 
French, it grew into one of the world's prime collections, preserved in 
exceptional condition by the dry air of the Castilian plateau. 

The glories of the Prado range over all the great names of the Italian, 
Flemish, German, Dutch, and French schools. Above all, it is the home base 
of the Spanish School-hence of El Greco (1541-1614), the Cretan who 
settled in Toledo; of the Sevillians, Diego de Velazquez (1599-1660) and 
Bartolome Murillo (1618-82); of the Valencian, Jose de Ribera (1591- 
1652): and of the incomparable Francisco de Goya (1746-1828), who was 
Spain's most celebrated contemporary painter when the Prado was opened. 



'Art galleries preserve the essence of man's creative genius.' 1 They 
provide perhaps the most accessible route into Europe's past, assailing the 
senses and arousing the imagination as no history book can do. The Prado 
stands at the top of a premier league of national galleries which includes the 
Louvre in Paris, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Kunsthistorisches 
Museum in Vienna, the National Gallery in London, the Hermitage in St 
Petersburg, the Uffizi in Llorence, and the Vaticano. They are supported by a 
second league of 'provincial' galleries and museums, Munich, in Cracow or 
in Oxford, often of surprising magnificence; by gal in Minsk, Manchester, or 
Munich, in Cracow or in Oxford, often of surprising magnificence; by 
galleries dedicated to modern art; and by a supporting cast of obscure and 
devoted institutions from Cholet to JQdrzejow or Dulwich. 

In 1784, when Lerdinand VII was born and the Prado building started, 
another European monarch was planning another public gallery. King 
Stanislaw-August of Poland had commissioned a dealer in London to 
assemble a selection of old masters to supplement his private collection in 
Warsaw. Then the Russo-Polish war and the partitions of Poland intervened. 
The King was deported to Russia, together with 2,900 of his pictures, which 
were destined to adorn Russian instead of Polish galleries. He never saw the 
paintings in London, which could not be paid for. They remained to form the 
core collection of the Dulwich Picture Gallery, which is one of those many 
minor treasure-houses that deserve to be better known. 2 


Judged by Continental standards of liberalism, Great Britain was both more 
and less advanced than its main rivals. On the one hand, Britain could fairly 
claim to be the home of 'the Mother of Parliaments', of the rule of law, of the 
Bill of Rights, and of free trade. British society was for long the most 
modernized and industrialized in Europe, and supposedly the most open to 
liberal ideas. On the other hand, British institutions were exceptional in never 
having experienced the shock of revolution or occupation. Prevailing political 
attitudes remained intensely pragmatic. The monarchy continued to reign 
according to rules and customs agreed in the late seventeenth century, as if the 
Lrench Revolution had never happened. In Queen Victoria (r. 1837-1901) and 
her extensive family it found the ideal foil for parliamentary government, a force 




for stability, and a channel for discreet influence abroad. There were republican 
sympathies in Britain, but no serious move to abolish the monarchy or to 
introduce a constitution, [gotha] 

Britain's ancient institutions were slow to reform. Radical reformers had to 
beat their heads on the gates, often for decades. The unreformed parliament, 
which survived till 1832, was a scandalous anachronism, like its French 
counterpart under the July Monarchy. The Corn Laws held out against Free 
Trade until 1846. Civil marriage and divorce only became possible in 1836 and 
1857 respectively. The demands for universal suffrage first voiced by the 
Chartists in 1838-48 were never fully conceded. The Church of England was 
never disestablished, except in Ireland (1869) and in Wales (1914). The feudal 
privileges of the House of Lords were not even trimmed until 1911. Religious 
toleration was never quite complete. The two-party system, which saw the 
ancient teams of Whigs and Tories reclothed as Liberals and Conservatives, 
delayed the advent of a strong socialist movement and of much social 
legislation. Under W. E. Gladstone (1809-98) and Benjamin Disraeli (1804-81), 
who dominated the scene in the third quarter of the century, and who both had 
liberal proclivities, domestic reforms were often overshadowed by the concerns 
of Empire. Wales remained an administrative part of England. Scotland received 
its own Secretary of State, a second-rank minister, in 1885. Ireland never 
achieved Home Rule (see below). Though liberal policies were followed with 
respect to the English-speaking dominions, there was little wish to extend them 
to the colonies at large. The British loved to pride themselves on their tolerance 
and liberalism; but much of their pride became outdated. In later decades they 
lagged well behind France in domestic democracy, behind Germany in social 
legislation, behind Austria-Hungary in nationality policy, [relaxatio] 


GOTHA 

The Thuringian Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha was established in 1826, 
when the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld was obliged by divorce to exchange 
Saalfeld for Gotha. Together with Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Meiningen, and 
Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, its eight tiny enclaves were ultimately destined to 
join the German Empire. 




The Duke had two sons-Ernest (1818-93) and Albert (1819-61). His 
brother Leopold (1790-1865) had once been married to the heiress of the 
House of Hanover, Charlotte Augusta. His sister Louise, also married to a 
Hanoverian, was the mother of Princess Victoria (1819-1901), conceived at 
Amorbach in Lranconia. The family's prospects greatly improved in 1830 
when, like her deceased aunt before her, Victoria unexpectedly emerged as 
heir presumptive to the Hanoverian succession, and Leopold as King-elect of 
Belgium. 

'Uncle Leopold' was the royal match-maker par excellence. Albert of 
Saxe-Coburg and Gotha was his nephew, and Victoria of Hanover his niece. 
In May 1836, he brought them together. They were both seventeen. They 
were to be 'the Lather and Mother of Europe'. 1 (See Appendix III, pp. 1300- 
1 .) 

The House of Hanover, which in earlier times had used the titles of 
'Luneburg-Celle' and 'Braunschweig-Liineburg', reigned simultaneously 
from 1714 as Electors (then Kings) of Hanover and Kings of the United 
Kingdom. Though resident in Britain, they had always taken German brides, 
whilst a staathalter or deputy ran their ancestral lands. Since the law of 
Hanover did not admit female monarchs, when Victoria ascended the British 
throne in 1837, Hanover passed to her father's brother and after that to 
Prussia. Albert and Victoria were married on 10 Lebruary 1840. They were 
blessed with nine children. As from 1858, the three eldest were married 
respectively to Lrederick William of Hohenzollern, the future German 
Emperor; to Princess Alexandra of Denmark; and to the future Grand-Duke 
Louis of Hesse-Darmstadt. 2 

The Grand Duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt had enjoyed only middling rank until 
the Grand Duke's daughter Marie married Alexander II Romanov, the future 
Tsar of Russia, in 1841. Two of Marie's sons took wives from the family of 
Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gluecksburg. Her daughter, also Marie, 
married Prince Alfred (1844-1900), Duke of Edinburgh, Admiral RN and 
the future Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The Darmstadt-St Petersburg 
alliance was reinforced first by the marriage of Elizabeth of Hesse to a 
Russian Grand Duke and then by the marriage of Elizabeth's younger sister 
Alix to Nicholas II, the last Tsar. 



The German family of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gluecksburg 
acquired the Danish throne in 1853. But they soon advanced further. 
Christian IX's eldest son, Frederick (1843-1912), was the progenitor of both 
the Danish and the Norwegian monarchies. His second son, William (1845- 
1913), was to marry a Russian Grand Duchess and, as George I, to found the 
Greek royal line. 3 His daughter Alexandra (1844-1925), wife of Edward, 
Prince of Wales, became British Queen. His second daughter, Marie (1847- 
1928), wife of Alexander III Romanov, became Tsarina. 

Into this dense nexus of Germanic cousinage there stepped the supreme 
arrivistes -the Battenbergs. 4 The Hessian Counts of Battenberg had died out 
in the fourteenth century. But their title was revived in 1858 for the benefit 
of a morganatic union. Prince Alexander of Hesse (1823-88) had 
accompanied his sister Marie to Russia, and had served in the Tsarist 
cavalry. But eloping with an imperial maid of honour, Julia Hauke (1825- 
95), daughter of a murdered Polish general, he fled Russia and took a 
commission in Vienna. His morganatic bride, renamed Julia, Countess von 
Battenberg, gave her progeny their good looks and their surname. Her sister 
wrote children's stories. Her brother served in 1848 as commander of the 
Polish Legion in Tuscany. 5 

Alexander and Julia had four sons. No. 2 married a princess of 
Montenegro. No. 3 was enthroned, and dethroned, in Bulgaria. No. 4, Count 
Henry, married Albert and Victoria's youngest child, Beatrice. But it was the 
eldest son who scooped the kinship jackpot. Married to Queen Victoria's 
favourite granddaughter, Victoria of Hesse, Count Louis Battenberg (1854- 
1921) was a cousin on the paternal side both to Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh 
and to Tsar Alexander III, and brother-in-law to Empress Alix. Having 
joined the Royal Navy as a cadet, he worked his way up to be Admiral, 
Director of Naval Intelligence, and, at the outbreak of war in 1914, Britain's 
First Sea Lord. Unfortunately as a German, he was immediately forced to 
retire. By then, his elder daughter had become Queen of Sweden and his 
younger daughter, Alice, a Princess of Greece. His niece was Queen of 
Spain. His younger son, Louis (1900-79), known as 'Dickie', later Earl of 
Burma, was to follow him into the British Admiralty. In July 1917 the family 
name was changed once again, this time from Battenberg to Mountbatten. 
Their Romanov relatives were under arrest, and their relatives in the House 



of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha-Hanover-Teck were hurriedly renaming themselves 
'Windsor'. 

In time, Admiral Louis Mountbatten revealed the same match-making talents 
as Queen Victoria's Uncle Leo. His favourite nephew was a young exiled 
prince from Greece called Philip. 6 Amongst the Windsors, the young 
Princess Elizabeth had unexpectedly emerged in 1937 as Britain's heir 
presumptive. 'Uncle Dickie' brought them together. Prince Philip of 
Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gluecksburg (b. 1921), and Princess 

Elizabeth of Windsor (b. 1926) were married in 1947. Both were descended 
in the same degree from the lines of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Hanover, 
Hesse, and Denmark. Except for some relations of Elizabeth's Scottish 
mother, neither had any modern English forebears. Both changed their 
names twice. Philip had taken his uncle's adopted name of Mountbatten. 
After his wife's Coronation as Elizabeth II in 1953, he and his family 
reverted by an Order in Council to the Queen's maiden name of Windsor. 
Skilful genealogists showed them to be descendants of Plantagenets, Tudors, 
and Stuarts, even of Charlemagne, Egbert, and King Alfred. 

When the House of Windsor was created by deed poll in 1917, the 
republican H. G. Wells had called them 'alien and uninspiring'. But their 
cousin, the German Kaiser, was less critical. In a rare flash of wit, he said 
that he was off to the theatre to see a performance of The Merry Wives of 
Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. 1 


The correlation between liberal politics and the growth of a powerful 
bourgeoisie has generated much historical comment, with special reference to 
the contrasts between Britain and Germany. Attention has been focused on 
Britain's success and Germany's failure in building a stable parliamentary 
system, and hence on the differences of structure and ethos in their middle 
classes. Unlike their British counterparts, the new German capitalists were seen 
to 'turn to the state', supposedly shirking their democratic duty and submitting to 
the guidance of enlightened but essentially illiberal ministers of the Prussian 
imperial service. The thesis about Germany's Sonderweg or 'special path' was 
inspired at a much later date by concern over the rise of Hitler, and by the 
weakness of German liberalism as shown by the 'collaboration of the capitalists' 




in the 1930s.- Prussia certainly set the example of a Rechtsstaat which 
honoured legal forms but in which constitutions were subject to the authoritarian 
traditions of court, army, and bureaucracy. This has given German imperial 
government after 1871 the label of a 'facade democracy'. On the other hand, one 
has to remember that the German Empire was a federal state, where several of 
the kingdoms were much less authoritarian than Prussia. 

In any case, a slightly wider sample of comparison might suggest that 
Germany's path was not so special after all. Sweden, for example, combined an 
expanding parliamentary system of the British type with an enlightened 
bureaucracy and a none-too-liberal capitalist class of the German type. Sweden's 
two-chamber parliament was organized at the instigation of liberal-minded 
bureaucrats in 1866. A capitalist bourgeoisie, which grew with rapid 
industrialization in the later decades, opposed the extension of the franchise, and 
did not involve itself with the Liberal Unity Party that took up the torch of 
liberal causes at the turn of the century. Swedish capitalists were no more 
interested in liberalism than their German partners. Swedish liberalism was 
inspired by a coalition linking state ministers, the non-capitalist 
Bildungsbiirgertum or 'educated middle class', and even peasants, who together 
ensured the preservation of Sweden's evolving democracy.- [nobel] 

Of all the major powers Russia was the most resistant to liberalism. 
Recurrent bouts of reform-after 1815,1855, and 1906-produced impressive 
results in certain circumscribed spheres. After the establishment of a Council of 
State and the creation of state schooling under Alexander I, and the 
emancipation of the serfs (1861) under Alexander II, important degrees of 
autonomy were granted to the mir or peasant communes, to the zemstva or 
district councils, to the universities, and to the criminal courts. A legislative 
assembly or State Duma, with consultative powers, was eventually established at 
the second attempt. It operated in fits and starts between 1906 and 1917, and 
promised to set Russia definitively on the road to constitutionalism. Yet progress 
proved more apparent than real. No reforming Tsar was able to sustain a liberal 
course for long. Both Alexander II and Nicholas II seemed to be driven on to the 
liberal path by military defeats-the one by defeat in the Crimea and the other 
by the Russo-Japanese War and the subsequent 'Revolution' of 1905. Both were 
forced to reverse direction. Each bout of reform was brought to an end by force 
majeure -by the Decembrist revolt of 1825, by the Polish rising of 1863-4, and 
by the outbreak of the First World War. In each case periods of fierce reaction 


followed, when liberal forces were repressed. One hundred years after the 
Congress of Vienna, the Russian autocracy and its police regime remained 
essentially intact. Nothing had been done to dent the fundamental right of the 
Tsar-Autocrat to rescind any concessions made. What is more, Russia had 
frequently intervened to stop the march of liberalism abroad. Although 
Alexander III abandoned direct interventionism, the long-standing instinct had 
been for Russia to act as 'Europe's gendarme'. When Nicholas I heard during a 
palace ball in February 1848 that Louis-Philippe had been overthrown, he 
announced: 'Gentlemen, saddle your horses! France is a Republic.' 

To a greater or lesser degree, therefore, the winds of liberalization blew 
through all the European monarchies. But their gusts were irregular and the 
effects ragged. European liberalism built up its head of steam during the 
reactionary decades after 1815, and made its greatest impact in the aftermath of 
the explosion of 1848. In the later part of the century, though liberals battled on, 
their uncompleted agenda was having to compete with the demands of 
Conservatism, Nationalism, Socialism, and Imperialism. 

Conservatism began to crystallize as a coherent ideology in conjunction with 
liberal trends. It was not opposed to democracy or to change as such, and should 
not be confused with simple reactionary positions. What it did was to insist that 
all change should be channelled and managed in such a way that the organic 
growth of established institutions of state and society-monarchy, Church, the 
social hierarchy, property, and the family-should not be threatened. Hence its 
name, from the Latin conservare: 'to preserve'. Typically, its founding father, 
Edmund Burke (see above), had welcomed the French Revolution, before 
turning decisively against its excesses. Like the liberals, the conservatives valued 
the individual, opposed the omnipotent state, and looked for a reduction of 
central executive powers. Through this, they often turned out to be the most 
effective of would-be reformers, toning down the proposals coming from more 
radical points on the spectrum, and acting as the go-between with the ruling 
court. The leading practitioners of the conservative art in Britain were Sir Robert 
Peel (1788-1850) and his disciple, Disraeli. They had many admirers on the 
Continent. The ultimate distinction between liberal conservatives and moderate 
liberals was a fine one. In many democracies, the large area of agreement 
between them came to define the 'middle ground' of political life. 



Nationalism, a collection of ideas regarding the nation, whose interests are taken 
to be the supreme good, has become one of the elemental forces of modern 
times. It received its greatest single boost from the French Revolution, and was 
crystallized by the social and political changes of nineteenth-century Europe. It 
has since travelled round all the continents of the globe. It came in two opposing 
variants. One of them, state or civic nationalism, was sponsored by the ruling 
establishments of existing states. The other, popular or ethnic nationalism, was 
driven by the demands of communities living within those states and against the 
policy of their governments. In this regard, some historians have contrasted the 
process of 'state-building' with that of 'nation-building'. The essential difference 
lay in the source of ideas and action. State nationalism was initiated 'at the top', 
among a political elite which sought to project its values downwards into society 
at large. Popular nationalism started 'at the grass roots', at the bottom, seeking to 
attract mass support before trying to influence or overthrow the existing order.- 
Another important distinction is made between peaceable cultural nationalism of 
the Herderian type, which is limited to the propagation or preservation of the 
culture of a national community, and aggressive political nationalism, which 
claims the right of self-determination to achieve the nation-state. - The nation¬ 
state is one where the great majority of citizens are conscious of a common 
identity, and share the same culture. 

There are as many theories on the essence of nations as there are theorists. 
But the essential qualities would seem to be spiritual in nature. 'The nation is a 
soul,' wrote Renan, 'a spiritual principle. [It] consists of two things. One is the 
common legacy of rich memories from the past. The other is the present 
consensus, the will to live together...' In order to reach that consensus, many 
members of the nation will have to forget the oppressions and injustices which 
once divided them. 'L'oubli, the act of forgetting, and one might even say 
historical falsehood, are necessary factors in the creation of nations.'- 

State nationalism, which was driven by the interests of the ruling elite, is 
well illustrated in the case of Great Britain, even better in that of the USA. In 
1707, when the United Kingdom came into existence, there was no British 
nation. The people of the British Isles thought of themselves as English, Welsh, 
Scots, or Irish. Over the years, however, the propagation of the dominant English 
culture, and the promotion of its loyal Protestant and English-speaking servants, 
gradually consolidated a strong sense of overlying British identity. In the 
nineteenth century, when the liberal establishment came to favour mass 


education, non-English cultures were actively suffocated. Welsh children, for 
example, if they dared to speak Welsh, were punished with the Welsh 'Note'. All 
'Britons' were expected to show loyalty to the symbols of a new British 
nationality-to speak standard English, to stand up and sing the royal anthem, 
'God Save Our Noble King' (i745)> and to respect the Union Jack (1801). In this 
way the new British nation was successfully forged. Its older component nations, 
though not eradicated, were relegated to the status of junior and subordinate 
partners. (See Chapter VIII.) 

Similarly, the US government was obliged to adopt an official national 
culture to replace those of its variegated immigrants. During the Civil War the 
US Congress allegedly voted for the compulsory adoption of English rather than 
German by the margin of one vote (though accounts of this disagree). Thereafter, 
before new citizens were allowed to swear loyalty to the 'Stars and Stripes', a 
knowledge of English was thought equal to a knowledge of the Constitution. The 
new, English-speaking American nation was forged under government 
sponsorship, especially by education. The adoption of the American version of 
English culture was put forward as the touchstone of success for ah immigrant 
families. 

One common characteristic of state nationalisms lies in their practice of 
equating the concepts of'citizenship' and 'nationality'. In official British usage, 
nationality has been made to mean citizenship, that is, something granted by 
British law. In American usage, 'nations' have been equated with countries or 
political states. Such terminology only confuses the issues, perhaps deliberately. 
It is partly responsible for persistent errors, such as that which has regarded all 
inhabitants of the Russian Empire or the Soviet Union as 'Russians'; and it 
contrasts unfavourably with the practices of countries where citizenship has to 
be more precisely defined.- State nationalism accepts that governments 
determine nationality, whilst abhorring the idea that nations can forge states. As 
Lord Acton wrote: 'A State can sometimes create a nation, but for a nation to 
create a state is going against nature.' 

Most European governments strove to strengthen the national cohesion of 
their subjects-by ceremonies, by symbolic art, by interpretations of history, 
above all by education and the promotion of a common culture. No nineteenth- 
century government planning to introduce universal primary education could 
avoid the crucial choice of language or languages in which the children were to 
be instructed. The Ottoman Empire, which had always granted autonomy to 


minority groups, was alone in never trying to enforce a common state culture. 
Austria-Hungary abandoned the attempt after 1867, overwhelmed by the 
contrary tides of popular nationalism. 

Popular nationalism, which grew from the grass roots, was planted like so 
many acorns under the dynastic states and multinational empires of the era. 
Firmly grounded in Rousseau's doctrine of popular sovereignty, it assumed that 
the proper forum for the exercise of the general will was provided by the 
national or ethnic community, not by the artificial frontiers of the existing states. 
It created an elaborate mythology where the 'blood' of the nation was 
inextricably mixed with the 'soil' of the national territory. Hence, if Italians lived 
on the territory of half a dozen states from Switzerland to Sicily, it was assumed 
that justice for the Italian nation involved the abolition of those states, and their 
replacement by one united Italian kingdom. Of course, most down-to-earth 
nationalists realized that the existence of a fully fledged nation, fully conscious 
of a uniform national culture, belonged largely to the realm of dreams. Once the 
Italian state was established, many Italian leaders knew that they would have to 
follow the example of other governments and use the power of the state to 
consolidate the culture and consciousness of its citizens. As Massimo d'Azeglio 
remarked in the opening session of the parliament of a united Italy in 1861, 
'Now that we have created Italy, we must start creating Italians.' 

Much of the nineteenth-century debate on nationality was dominated by the 
conviction that the peoples of Europe could be divided into 'historic' and 
'unhistoric' nations. The idea first appeared in Hegel. It was adopted by social 
Darwinists, who looked on the competition between nations as an evolutionary 
process, with some fitted for independent survival and others destined for 
extinction. With Marx, the economic factor came to the fore. Criteria and 
calculations naturally varied, and the list of potential nation-states differed 
widely. None the less, by the mid-nineteenth century a measure of consensus had 
been reached. It was generally assumed that the established Powers-France, 
Britain, Pmssia, Austria, and Russia-possessed a historic destiny, as did the 
states whom the Powers already recognized-Spain, Portugal, Belgium, the 
Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, and Greece-and the leading national 
contenders-the Italians, the Germans, and the Poles. Mazzini sketched a map of 
the future Europe containing twelve nation-states. 

In reality, the concept of historicity was entirely subjective, not to say 
spurious. Three of the five Powers, whose admirers assumed that they were 



among the most permanent fixtures of the European scene, were destined to 
disappear within a century. Several countries, like Denmark or Great Britain, 
who liked to think of themselves as cohesive nation-states, were destined to 
learn that they were not. Many of the nations who felt that they had an iron-clad 
case for self-determination were due to be disillusioned. Here, the decisive 
factors turned out to be neither size, nor economic viability, nor valid historical 
claims, but political circumstance. The German nationalists, who had little 
chance when opposed by the might of Prussia, were assured of success as soon 
as Prussia changed heart. The hopes of the Italians were dependent on the active 
support of France. The Poles, whose historic statehood remained within living 
memory until the 1860s, had no outside support, and no luck. Politics alone 
decided that Greeks, Belgians, Romanians, and Norwegians might succeed, 
where for the time being the Irish, the Czechs, or the Poles could not. At first, 
the crumbling Ottoman Empire offered the most obvious prospects for change. 
The nationalities of the Tsarist and Habsburg empires, which were to produce the 
largest number of nation-states, did not come to the fore until the turn of the 
century. [ABKHAZIA] 

Nevertheless, nationalism did not only flourish where it was most likely to 
succeed: on the contrary, it thrived on deprivation and repression. One might 
almost say that the fervency of the national ideal increased in proportion to the 
improbability of its success. Throughout the century, committed national 
activists strove to arouse the consciousness of the people whom they wished to 
recruit. Poets, artists, scholars, politicians appealed to six main sources of 
information to construct the image of reality that was to inspire the faithful. 

History was raked to furnish proof of the nation's age-long struggle for its 
rights and its land. Prehistory was a favourite subject, since it could be used to 
substantiate claims to aboriginal settlement. Where facts could not be found, 
recourse had to be made to myth or to downright invention. National heroes and 
heroines, and distant national victories, were unearthed to be praised. Anything 
of universal interest was ignored. Anything that reflected discredit on the nation, 
or credit on its foes, was passed over. 

Language was reformed and standardized as proof of the nation's separate 
and unique identity. Dictionaries and grammars were compiled, and libraries 
collected, where none had existed before. Textbooks were prepared for national 
schools and national universities. Linguists set out to show that previously 
neglected vernaculars were every bit as sophisticated as Latin or Greek; that 



Czech or Catalan or Gaelic or Norwegian was every bit as efficient a means of 
communication as the existing state languages. The Norwegian case was 
specially interesting. A composite construct of peasant dialects called nynorsk or 
landsmal (New Norse or 'country language') was invented in order to challenge 
the established riksmal or bokmal (the 'state language '/'book language' of 
Denmark and Norway). The New Norse movement, which came to a head in 
1899, saw itself as the necessary partner to the drive for political independence. 
But like Gaelic in Ireland, it achieved only limited success, [norge] 


ABKHAZIA 

The Abkhazians are a small nation of less than a quarter of a million souls 
living on the Black Sea Coast some 300 miles east of the Crimea. Their chief 
city is Sukhum or Sukhumi. Their language and Moslem culture, which 
resemble those of the Circassians, have little in common either with the 
Russians to the north or the Christian Georgians to the east. They say that 
they live 'at the end of Europe'. 

The site of a medieval kingdom, which flourished under Byzantine- 
Greek influence, Abkhazia has always occupied a vital location linking 
southern Russia with the Caucasus. Its conquest by the Tsars between 1810 
and 1864 (see Appendix III, p. 1290) forced many natives to flee. From 
1931, it became one of three nominally autonomous republics within the 
Georgian SSR; and a major influx of Russians and Mingrelian-Georgians 
turned the local population into an absolute minority in their own land. 
Stalin's police chief, Beria, who was himself a Mingrelian, deported the 
entire community of Pontic Greeks whilst initiating the brutal policy of 
georgianization. 

Hence, when Georgia broke free from Moscow in 1991, the Abkhazians 
sought a measure of genuine self-rule from Georgia. Yet their conflict with 
Tiflis during the devastating Georgian civil war of 1992-3 only opened the 
way for the re-occupation of Abkhazia by Russian forces. As a foreign 
reporter was told by a Cossack ataman, the fate of peripheral territories like 
Abkhazia or the Kurile Islands would test Russia's greatness. 'These are ours 
-and that's the truth.' 1 




Discord among the ex-Soviet nationalities was fuelling an ugly brand of 
Russian nationalism. Voices in Moscow called for the re-conquest of 
Russia's 'near abroad'. For after Abkhazia, there waited several further 
targets for Russian intervention, including Tatarstan and Chechenia, and 
other non-Russian lands within the Russian Federation. Sooner or later, 
Russia would be forced to choose between its new-style democracy and its 
old-style imperialism. 


Folklore, or Volkskunde, was mined for all it was worth. For one thing, it was 
thought to join the modern nation to its most ancient cultural roots; for another, 
its authenticity could not be easily checked. Unlike Herder, whose collection of 
Volkslieder (1778) had included songs from Greenland to Greece, nationalist 
scholars confined themselves to national folklore. In this connection, the work of 
the brothers Jakob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm Grimm (1786-1859) must be 
regarded as seminal. Their huge range included the iiber den altdeutschen 
Meistergesang, the Deutsche Sagen, the Deutsche Grammatik, and the world- 
famous Kinder- und Hausmarchen (1812-15), 'Grimms' Tales'. Their Serbian 
contemporary Vuk Karadzic* (1787-1864) published a well-known collection of 
Serbo-Slavonic tales in addition to his grammar, his dictionary, and his reform of 
the Cyrillic alphabet, [kalevala] 

Religion was mobilized to sanctify national sentiment, and in many instances 
to erect barriers between ethnic groups. For national Protestant or Orthodox 
Churches this form of separatism had long existed. But even the Roman Catholic 
religion could be turned against its universal mission, to separate Croats from 
Serbs, to keep Lithuanians immune from russification, or Poles from germaniza- 
tion. In some countries Christians looked on bemused as interest was revived in 
the rites and practices of the nation's pagan gods. Welsh Baptist ministers 
dressed up as Druids at the Welsh national Eisteddfod; the Germanic gods rode 
again on the stage and page of imperial Germany, [shaman] 

Racial theories exerted powerful attractions. The notion of a Caucasian race 
was invented in the late eighteenth century. The allied notion of the 'Aryan race' 
was first uttered in 1848 by a German professor in Oxford, Max Muller. Every 
nationality in Europe was tempted to conceive of itself as a unique racial kinship 
group, whose blood formed a distinct and separate stream. Extraordinary interest 
was devoted to ethnology, and to the study of 'racial types' that supposedly 




corresponded to each of the modern nations. In London, the Royal Historical 
Society sponsored a series of experiments on its Fellows showing that the brain¬ 
pans of those with Celtic names were inferior to those of Anglo-Saxon origin.- 
(There is no hope for the Davieses.) In Germany, the science of eugenics came 
up with similar results. Houston Stewart Chamberlain (1855-1927), an 
Englishman resident in Germany, narrowed the creative race from Aryans to 
Teutons. True history', he wrote, 'begins from the moment when the German 
with mighty hand seizes the inheritance of antiquity.' Or again, 'Whoever 
maintains that Christ was a Jew is either ignorant or dishonest.'- [Caucasia] 

In Russia, the pan-Slav movement was loaded with racial overtones. Arguing 
for the unification of all Slav peoples under the aegis of the Tsar, it often 
assumed that political solidarity would emerge from the (non-existent) racial 
affinity of the Slavs. It enjoyed little resonance among Catholic Poles and 
Croats, who had both produced earlier versions of pan-Slavism, and who now 
countered with scientific papers showing that the Russians were really slavicized 
Finns.- It enjoyed its greatest currency amongst Serbs, Czechs, and Bulgars, all 
of whom looked to Russia for liberation. Russian nationalism, blended with pan- 
Slavism, exhibited unparalleled messianic fervour. Dostoevsky could wring an 
optimistic note from the most unpromising material: 

Our great people were brought up like beasts. They have suffered tortures ever since they came into being, 
tortures which no other people could have endured but which only made them stronger and more compact 
in their misfortunes ... Russia, in conjunction with Slavdom, and at its head, will utter to the world the 
greatest word ever heard; and that word will be a covenant of human fellowship... [For] the Russian 
national idea, in the last analysis, is but the universal fellowship of man.- 

This was wishful thinking on a scale well suited to the country concerned. 


KALEVALA 

The Kalevala or 'Land of Heroes' is generally regarded as the national epic 
of the Finns. It is a poem of some 50 cantos or 22,795 lines, published first 
in 1835 and in its second, definitive edition in 1849. It is a semi-literary epic 
compiled largely from authentic folklore. In fact it is, in large measure, the 
product of its main compiler, Elias Lonnrot (1802-84), who used classical 





models to transform and embellish the raw oral materials which he had 
collected among the peasants of eastern Finland and Russian Karelia. As 
such, it illustrates not only the legacy of Europe's pagan folklore but also the 
process whereby nineteenth-century activists drew on neglected popular 
sources to create a national consciousness. Herder (1744-1803) had 
established the idea that modern nations can only flourish when they possess 
a distinct cultural identity based on the vernacular language and on popular 
traditions. The Kalevala was a Herderian exercise par excellence. 

In Lonnrot's time the Finns passed from rule by Sweden to that of Tsarist 
Russia, and were feeling the urge to dissociate themselves from the culture 
of their Swedish and Russian masters. The stories centre on Vainamoinen, 
the 'Eternal Sage' who presides over the land of Kalevala, leading it in the 
struggle against Pohjola, peopled by gods, giants, and unseen spirits: 


Siitavanha Vainamoinen, 
Laskea karehtelevi 
Venehella vaskisella, 
Kuutilla kuparisella 
Ylaisihin maaemihin 
Alaisihin taivosihin. 
Sinne puuttui pursinensa, 
Venehinensa vasahyti. 
Jatti kantelon jalille, 
Soiton Suomelle sorean, 
Kansalle ilon ikuisen, 
Laulut suuret lapsillensa. 


Then the aged Vainamoinen 
Went upon his journey singing, 
Sailing in his boat of copper, 

In his vessel made of copper, 

To the land beneath the heavens 
Sailed away to loftier regions. 

There he rested with his vessel 
Rested weary, with his vessel, 

But his kantele he left us. 

Left his charming harp in Suomi, 
For his people's lasting pleasure, 
Mighty songs for Suomi's children . 1 


All the nations of Europe passed through the phase of compiling, 
romanticizing, and inventing their folklore. The republication of the 
Arthurian romances of Chretien de Troyes and Sir Thomas Malory belonged 
to the same trend. Even the Americans wanted to participate; and Lonnrot's 
work exerted a strong influence on the Hiawatha (1855) of Henry 
Longfellow, who knew a German translation of Kalevala published in 1851 
by a member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences in St Petersburg. 

National epics such as the Finnish Kalevala or the Welsh Mabinogion 
held special significance for those nations whose drive towards a separate 
cultural identity was inhibited by political dependence. It is not surprising to 
find that both Hiawatha and the Kalevala had been translated into Polish by 
the 1860s. 



SHAMAN 

The Shaman, or tribal 'medicine man', is a well-known figure among the 
native peoples of Siberia, and further afield among the Innuit and 
Amerindians. Folk healer, sage, and magician, he is a member of an 
immemorial profession whose potions, rituals, and proverbs give him unique 
authority. Dressed perhaps in a horned mask, and carrying the characteristic 
instrument of his trade, the drum, with which he communes with the spirits 
of wood, stone, and sky, he can be a force for good or for evil. He travels 
unseen to the other worlds, above and below, and brings mankind the 
wisdom of the Great Spirit. Shamanism has survived until modern times in 
many remote parts of Russia; but it is not entirely expected in Central 
Europe. 1 Women, too, can shamanize. 

In Hungary, controversy over the origins of the Magyars raged 
throughout the nineteenth century. They were popularly thought to be related 
to the Huns, [csaba] But scholars thought otherwise. One school looked to 
Iranian or Khazar forebears. Another, founded by Janos Sajnovits (1733- 
85), looked farther to the east. Since then, the Finno-Ugrian connection has 
been definitively proved by philologists, archaeologists, and anthropologists. 
A burial site at Bol'she Tigan on the Kama River, for example, discovered in 
1974, has been confirmed as one of the major staging-posts before the 
Magyars moved off to the West. Similarly, modern research into Magyar 
folklore has revealed numerous traces of Shamanism, thereby underscoring 
the once unsuspected association with Siberia. 2 


All over Europe, every branch of art and literature was mobilized to illustrate 
and to embroider national themes. Poets sought to win the accolade of national 
bard or 'poet laureate'. Novelists developed a penchant for writing historical or 
pseudo-historical romances about national heroes and national customs. The 
Waverley novels of Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832) were the acknowledged model 
in this field, although earlier examples can be found. A novel called Thaddeus of 
Warsaw (1803) by Jane Porter (1776-1850), who fictionalized the life of 
Kosciuszko, gained international celebrity. Painters and sculptors followed 





Romantic hankerings in the same direction. France's leading Romantic, Victor 
Hugo (1802-85), contrived to shine in all fields at once. 

Musicians recruited the harmonies and rhythms of their native folk dance 
and folksong to elaborate distinctive national styles that became the hallmark of 
numerous 'national schools'. From the exquisite mazurkas and polonaises of 
Chopin and the Hungarian Rhapsodies of Liszt, a brilliant trail leads through the 
delights of the Czechs Bedfich Smetana (1824-84), Antonin Dvorak (1841- 
1904) and Leoa Janaeek (1854-1928); the Norwegian Edvard Grieg (1843- 
1907), the Finn Jan Sibelius (1865-1957), and the Dane Carl Nielsen (1865- 
1931); the Spaniards Isaac Albeniz (1860-1909), Enrique Granados (1867- 
1916), and Manuel de Falla (1876-1946); the Hungarians Bela Bartok (1881- 
1945) and Zoltan Kodaly (1882-1967); the Englishmen Edward Elgar (1857- 
1934), Frederick Delius (1862-1934), and Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872- 
1958); and the famous Russian 'Five'-Cesar Cui (1835-1916), Mily Balakirev 
(1836-1910), Alexander Borodin (1833-87), Nicholas Rimsky-Korsakov (1844- 
1909) and Modeste Mussorgsky (1839-81). These national schools served to 
widen the social appeal of music. What is more, nations who were thwarted by 
the language barrier from furthering their cause through literature could address 
the whole of Europe through the concert hall. 

Interestingly, the abstract nature of music invited a wide range of reaction to 
the same scores. A composer like Chopin could appeal not only to listeners who 
were well attuned to his political message but equally to others who were totally 
oblivious. There was no contradiction between the national and the universal 
aspects of his genius. The deliciously ambiguous emotional qualities of his 
bitter-sweet Polish melodies were woven into alternating moods of rousing 
protest and melancholic languor. For some, he translated Polish history into 
notes on the keyboard; for others, he conjured up poignancies of a purely 
personal and intimate character. As Robert Schumann said of perhaps the most 
famous piece by Chopin, the 'Revolutionary Etude', Op. 10 No. 12, it spoke of 
'guns buried in flowers': 














In the world of opera, national myths were yoked to stupendous sounds to 
form musical dramas of unequalled power. An audience which has watched and 
listened, riveted to their seats, during a performance of Mussorgsky's Boris 
Godunov or Wagner's Ring lose all concern for the rights and wrongs of history. 
National operaties is a field where the magnificence of the music only seems to 
be enhanced by the unlikeliness of the libretto, [nibelung] [opera] [susanin] 

[TRISTAN] 

That the growth of nationalism was closely intertwined with the 
modernization of European society is undeniable. Indeed, some historians of the 
Marxist persuasion go so far as to insist that the correlation was absolute. The 
basic characteristic of the modern nation and of everything connected with it', 
writes one of them, 'is its modernity.'- This sort of assertion spoils a good case 
by overstatement. Political oppression could be every bit as effective as socio¬ 
economic modernizationin stimulating modern nationalism; and there are several 
instances of precocious national movements which were well developed long 
before modernization took hold. What the modernizing processes certainly did 
do was to change the nature of existing nationalisms, and to expand their social 
constituency beyond all previous limits. 'The Transformation of Nationalism' in 
the prime era of Europe's modernization after 1870 was a reality which few 
would want to refute. 

Nationalism also underlined an important distinction between 'civilization' 
and 'culture'. Civilization was the sum total of ideas and traditions which had 
been inherited from the ancient world and from Christianity, it was grafted onto 
the native cultures of all the peoples of Europe from the outside, to form the 
common legacy. Culture (Kultur in the German sense), in contrast, grew from 
the everyday life of the people. It was made up from all that was specific to a 
particular nation: their native speech, their folklore, their religious deviations, 
their idiosyncratic practices. In earlier times, civilization had been extolled and 
culture despised. Nationalism now did the opposite. National cultures were 
extolled, and common civilization downgraded. The educated, multilingual, 
cosmopolitan elite of Europe grew weaker; the half-educated national masses, 
who thought of themselves only as Frenchmen, Germans, English, or Russians, 
grew stronger. 

Theorizing about Nationalism has not abated with time. Among the ideas in 
vogue in the late twentieth century, one would have to consider the above- 
mentioned sociological link between Nationalism and Modernization: the 
psychological concept of the Nation as 'an imagined community', to which 


uprooted or newly educated individuals chose to belong: and the notion of 
'Invented Tradition'-the mechanism whereby nascent nations created their own 
mythologies. It is interesting to note that each of these very contemporary ideas 
can be found in the writings of a little-known Polish socialist and social theorist, 
Kazimierz Kelles-Krauz (1872-1905).- 

The passions of nationalism inevitably fuelled conflict. Almost all parts of 
Europe contained ethnic minorities whose popular nationalisms were bound to 
clash with the state-led nationalism of the authorities. In Britain there were three 
potential separatist movements; in the Russian Empire there were seventy. Even 
in the German Empire, which was remarkably homogeneous from the ethnic 
point of view, long-running conflicts emerged in the former Polish provinces, on 
the Danish border in Schleswig-Holstein, and in Alsace-Lorraine, [elsass] 
[slesvig] Important conflicts also arose between leaders of the national 
movements and leaders of liberal or socialist opinion who either disagreed with 
nationalism per se or objected to the priority given to national goals. 

Russia was a case in point, where the imperial state-building of the Romanov 
dynasty came into conflict not only with the non-Russian peoples of the Empire 
but also with the popular nation-building sentiments of the Russians themselves. 
In the old Muscovite heartland, the 'Empire' lived uneasily alongside the 
'Nation'. Imperial institutions based on the court, the nobility, and the 
bureaucracy operated like a foreign occupying power within a largely peasant 
society with which they had little in common. Emancipation of the serfs only 
postponed the frustrations of this peasant nation, whose life was based on the 
village commune and the Russian Orthodox Church. The failure of early 
nineteenth-century attempts to launch a vernacular Russian Bible, which could 
have served as the foundation-stone of a modern national culture, has been seen 
as crucial. 

As the decades passed, nationalism frequently assumed a more tmculent 
tone. National movements which had started as part of the liberal crusade against 
reactionary dynasties became frustrated when their demands could not be fully 
realized. Hence in the last quarter of the century, the 'old liberating and unifying 
nationalism' frequently gave way to an intolerant strain of 'integral nationalism'. 
Talk began about the expulsion of minorities, and of the 'treason' of anyone not 
conforming to the nationalists' own dogmatic definition of their community. (It 
was in this negative sense that the term 'nationalism' entered general currency in 
the 1890s.) Germany was to be for Germans alone, 'Romania for the 


Romanians', Ruritania for the Ruritanians. 

It was in imperial Germany, perhaps, that the ideas of Blut und Boden or 
'blood and soil' took deepest root. But it was in France that integral nationalism 
found its most coherent advocates, in the writings of Maurice Barres (1862- 
1923) and of Charles Maurras (1868-1952), co-founders in 1899 of the 
movement Action Frangaise. For them, France was for Frenchmen alone, and for 
loyal, native-born, Catholic Frenchmen at that. Barres, Deputy for the Moselle, 
spent his career fighting for the return of Alsace-Lorraine from Germany. His 
book Les Deracines (The Uprooted, 1897) gave a label to the idea of rootless 
and hence worthless elements of society. It would soon be turned against the 
Jews, amongst others. La Colline inspiree (1913) advanced the notion that 
Catholicism and true Frenchness were inseparable. Maurras took a leading role 
as an anti-Dreyfusard, and later as a supporter of Petain in Vichy France. His 
language became so extreme that in 1926 his writings were placed on the 
Catholic Index. 

Integral nationalism affected all the national movements of the fin de siecle. 
In addition to Germany and France, it made a deep impact in Poland, where the 
National Democratic Movement of Roman Dmowski (1864-1939) was very 
characteristic of the trend. In Italy it was inherent in the activities of the 
irredentists, such as Gabriele D'Annunzio (1863-1938), who were trying to prise 
Trieste and South Tyrol from Austria. In Russia it led to the rejection of all who 
did not conform to the identification of Russianness with Orthodoxy. In Great 
Britain it could be observed among all who equated 'British' with 'English'. In 
Ireland it was represented both by the stance of many Protestant Ulstermen, who 
saw no place in Ulster for Catholics, and by the extreme tendency among Irish 
Catholic nationalists, who regarded all protestants and Anglo-Irish as agents of 
alien domination. Among Jews it could be observed in the wing of Zionism 
which saw Palestine not just as a refuge for oppressed Jews but as the land for a 
'Jewish State', where non-Jews would have to live on sufferance. 

Much depended on the political environment within which the various 
national movements were obliged to operate. Some political theorists have been 
tempted to place the 'moderate, humane, and liberating' forms of nationalism in 
Western Europe, and to lump the nationalisms of Eastern Europe into the 
intolerant, ethnic category.- This classification is patently unjust. There are 
many instances of intolerant, ethnic nationalism in Western Europe, from the 
IRA to the Flemish Fatherland Front. Many national movements in Eastern 


Europe have included both so-called 'Western' and 'non-Western' elements. The 
labels simply do not fit. What is true is that the autocratic empires of Eastern 
Europe inhibited nationalism of the liberal type, encouraging violent opposition 
from all sources. Whereas popular nationalism was given full rein in most parts 
of Europe in the fifty years after 1870, many of those peoples who found 
themselves under the control of the Russian Empire had to postpone their hopes 
of liberation for nearly a century. This delay was due more to the nature of 
successive Russian states than to the inherent characteristics of their captive 
peoples. 

The Italian national liberation movement was in action for three-quarters of a 
century before its objective was achieved in 1871. It is known as il 
Risorgimento, 'the Resurgence', after a newspaper founded in 1847 in Turin by 
its most effective leader, Count Camillo di Cavour (1810-61), Prime Minister of 
Sardinia. But its origins lay among the secret independence societies, among 
them the famous Carbonari, who launched the abortive revolts in Naples (1820), 
Turin (1821), and Rome (1830), and the Giovane Italia or 'Young Italy' of 
Giuseppe Mazzini (1805-72). Mazzini, national revolutionary and prophet, spent 
much of his life in exile, in Marseilles, Berne, and London. He created a national 
ideology, roused his compatriots from apathy, and called on sympathetic rulers, 
like Charles Albert of Sardinia, to support them. 'A nation', he declared, 'is the 
universality of citizens speaking the same tongue.' In 1834 he founded an 
international branch of his campaign, Young Europe, which trained a network of 
conspirators for preparing democratic constitutions all over the Continent. 

1848, the Year of Revolutions, brought Italy to the forefront of the eruptions 
sweeping Europe. Independent republics were proclaimed in Venice and Rome. 
Sicily and Naples turned on their Bourbon monarch, Ferdinand II. Charles- 
Albert launched a 'Holy War' on Austria, hoping to benefit from the revolt of 
Milan. All were crushed amidst the counter-attacks of General Radetzky and the 
merciless bombardments of 'King Bomba'. Mazzini's slogan, 'Italia fara da se' 
(Italy will do it alone), had failed. His romantic associate Giuseppe Garibaldi 
(1807-82), who had fought both in Rome and in Venice, fled to South America. 

Conditions improved a decade later. Cavour's Sardinia was converted to the 
Italian cause as the best means of dislodging the Austrians. After the fine 
performance of Sardinian troops in the Crimea, Napoleon III asked quaintly, 
'What can I do for Italy?' and a Franco-Sardinian Pact was duly signed. France 
undertook to support Sardinia in the north against Austria, whilst continuing to 



defend the Papal States in the centre. Three wars later the game was complete. In 
1859-60 the victories at Magenta and Solferino assured the success of the 
Franco-Sardinian attack on Austrian Italy, whilst the sensational private 
expedition of Garibaldi's 'Thousand' redshirts assured the fell of Sicily and 
Naples. Plebiscites in Parma, Modena, and Tuscany all voted for Italy; France 
took Savoy and Nice; Austria still held Venetia; and with French help the Pope 
still ruled in Rome. But in May 1861 an all-Italian parliament at Turin 
proclaimed Victor Emmanuel II (r. 1849-78) King of Italy. In 1866, with Austria 
at war with Prussia, Italy contrived the cession of Venetia. In 1870, with France 
at war with Prussia, Italy seized the remainder of the Papal States and confined 
the Pope to the Vatican. Except for the Trentino (South Tyrol) and Istria, the 
Kingdom of Italy was complete. Cavour was dead; Garibaldi retired to the Isle of 
Caprera; Mazzini, the republican, still in exile, was heartbroken. (See Appendix 
III, p. 1304.) [GATTOPARDO] 

The progress of the German national movement resembled that of its Italian 
counterpart in all essential respects. It began amidst the enthusiasm of the 'War 
of Liberation' of 1813-14 and the secret societies of the Restoration period. It 
met its greatest setback in 1848, when an all-German assembly was convened 
only to be disbanded. It reached its goal in 1871, when the King of Prussia was 
converted to the cause. 

In the period before March 1848, known as the Vormarz, the futility of the 
German Confederation became self-evident. Its Diet declined into little more 
than a court of appeal. It was still preoccupied in settling debts from the Thirty 
Years War. The article of its constitution requiring each of the German princes to 
convene a parliament was observed or ignored at will. Liberal initiative was 
stifled by the princes' right to annul legislation and to call in outside assistance. 
In 1848-9 Germany was set alight, like France and Italy, with risings in Vienna, 
Berlin, Cologne, Prague, Dresden, Baden, and elsewhere. The national 
Vorparlament which met in St Paul's Church in Frankfurt drew up a constitution 
for a future German Empire. But it could not put any of its deliberations into 
effect. It was deeply divided by the question of Schleswig-Holstein. It could not 
decide whether Germany should be confined to German ethnic territory or 
should include all of the Austrian Empire, which was predominantly non- 
German. It offered the Crown to Frederick-William IV of Prussia, who turned 
down an honour 'that smelled of the gutter'. It broke up in July 1849 amidst 
recrimination and repression. (See Appendix III, p. 1303.) 



Prussia's conversion to German reunification took place in the 1860s, largely 
as a means for breaking out of the German Confederation and the hopeless 
entanglement with Austria. In the early years of William I (r. 1861-88) Prussia's 
affairs had reached a very ambiguous condition. The authoritarian establishment 
had been strengthened by the military reforms of von Roon, whilst the Landtag 
elections had produced a liberal majority headed by the Fortschrittspartei of 
Waldeck. In 1862 Otto von Bismarck (1815-98) was appointed Premier to sort 
out the resultant crisis, if necessary by unconstitutional measures. His aim was to 
put Prussia 'in the saddle' in Germany, and Germany in the saddle in Europe. 
Immense friction was being caused by the joint Prusso-Austrian administration 
of Schleswig-Holstein. William I could not decide whether to lead the 
Confederation or to leave it to Francis-Joseph, as he did for the Frankfurt 
Furstentag in 1863. All these issues were settled by Bismarck's determination to 
create a new North German Confederation without Austria, and by the masterly 
use of limited war. In 1864 Prussia attacked and defeated Denmark for annexing 
Schleswig. In 1866, when Austria referred the Schleswig Question to the 
Confederation Diet, Prussia promptly walked out, attacking and defeating 
Austria and Austria's German allies. The lightning victory at Sadova, near 
Hradec Kralove (Koniggratz), ensured Prussian supremacy, and the formation of 
the North German Federation. In 1870-1 Prussia attacked and defeated France. 
In the ensuing euphoria, Bismarck arranged for the Federation to admit the 
South German states and for William I to be proclaimed German Emperor. 
Germany was reunited; the conservative citadel was triumphant, and the liberals 
baffled. [Hermann] 



GATTOPARDO 


May 1860. 'Nunc et in hora mortis nostrae. Amen.' The daily recital of the 
Rosary was over. For half an hour the steady voice of the Prince had recalled 
the Sorrowful and the Glorious Mysteries; other voices had interwoven a 
lilting hum from which, now and again, would chime some unlikely word; 
love, virginity, death. During that hum the whole aspect of the rococo 
drawing room seemed to change. Even the parrots spreading iridescent 
wings over the silken walls appeared abashed. Even the Magdalen between 
the two windows looked penitent... 

Now everything returned to its usual order or disorder. Bendico, the 
Great Dane, came wagging his tail through the door by which the servants 
had left. The women rose slowly to their feet, their swaying skirts baring the 
naked, mythological figures painted all over the milky depths of the tiles. 
Only an Andromeda remained covered by the soutane of Father Pirrone, still 
deep in extra prayer.. / 

Don Fabrizio Corbera, Prince of Salina, was performing the ageless family 
rituals at his villa above Palermo. Sicily was passing through the uneasy 
interval between the abortive rising in Messina in April and Garibaldi's 
landing at Marsala on 11 May. The Prince, known from his coat-of-arms as 
'the Leopard', was entering the twilight of the Bourbon monarchy, of feudal 
privilege, and of his own blighted emotional life. 

Historical novels come in many categories. The cheap ones pillage the past 
to provide an exotic backdrop to unrelated fiction. Some use it as a neutral 
stage to impart conviction to the discussion of timeless issues. A few can 
enrich one's understanding both of history and of humanity. // Gattopardo 
(The Leopard), published in 1958, was the posthumous work of Giuseppe 
Tomasi (1896-1957), Duke of Palma and Prince of Lampedusa. Rarely has a 
novelist shown such empathy, such historical sensitivity. 

May 1910. Don Fabrizio's three maiden daughters still live at the Villa 
Salina. The relics of the family chapel have to be cast out, having been 



declared false by the Cardinal Archbishop. By chance, Bendico's fur, long 
preserved as a mg, is thrown out with them. As the carcass was dragged off, 
the glass eyes stared at her with humble reproach. What remained of 
Bendico was flung into a corner of the yard. During its flight from the 
window, its form recomposed itself for an instant; in the air there seemed to 
be a dancing quadruped with long whiskers, its right foreleg raised in 
imprecation. Then all found peace in a little piece of livid dust. Poi tutto 
trovo pace in un mucchietto di polvere livida. 3 


The Polish national movement had the longest pedigree, the best credentials, the 
greatest determination, the worst press, and the least success. It traced its origins 
to the anti-Russian confederations of the eighteenth century, and it bred an armed 
rising in every generation between the Partitions and the Second World War-in 
1733,1768,1794,1830,1848,1863,1905,1919,1944. It nourished a precocious 
brand of nationalism which was already maturing in Napoleonic times. At heart 
this had little to do with economic rationale, everything with the will to preserve 
culture, identity, and honour. 

The Polish risings of the early nineteenth century aimed to restore the 
crucified commonwealth of Poland-Lithuania. They were driven on by the 
mystical images of romantic poetry, by the conviction that Poland, 'the Christ of 
Nations', would have its 'Third Day': 

Hail, O Christ, Thou Lord of Men! 

Poland in Thy footsteps treading 
Like Thee suffers, at Thy bidding 
Like Thee, too, shall rise again.- 

The principal actions were directed from the Congress Kingdom against 
Russia, although Poles from Austria and Prussia also took part. Sympathetic 
outbreaks occurred in Lithuania, Byelorussia, and Ukraine. In November 1830 a 
wild conspiracy, provoked by rumours of the Tsar's plan to dispatch his Polish 
army against Belgium, sparked a Russo-Polish war. The Tsar rejected the advice 
of a government in Warsaw taken over by the conservative Prince Czartoryski 
and refused all dialogue. So matters were left to the intransigents. On this 
occasion the professional Polish army had a real chance of victory, but was 
gradually outflanked and overwhelmed. In September 1831, when the Russians 
stormed the last emplacements near Warsaw, they found the corpse of General 





Sowiriski still upright among the fields of dead and dying. The old Napoleonic 
officer had ordered his men to plant his wooden leg 'firmly in the Polish soil', so 
as not to bow to tyrants. The constitution of the Congress Kingdom was 
suspended. All insurgents were deprived of their freedom and their property. Ten 
thousand exiles found their way to France; tens of thousands more were marched 
to Siberia in chains. 


HERMANN 

T he Hermannsdenkmal, the monument to Arminius, stands on a lofty 
outcrop above the wooded slopes of the Teutoburgerwald near Detmold in 
Westphalia. It commemorates the victory in ad 9 of the Germanic chieftain 
Hermann, or Arminius the Cherascon, who somewhere nearby annihilated 
the invading Roman legions. A colonnaded pedestal supports a gigantic 
statue in beaten copper nearly 30 m in height. Ten times life size, Hermann 
frowns under his winged helmet as he brandishes a huge sword of vengeance 
over the plain below. 

The monument took nearly forty years to build. Like the classical 
Temple of Walhalla (1830-42), built by the King of Bavaria on a bluff 
overlooking the Danube near Regensburg, it was conceived in a generation 
that remembered Napoleon and the wars of liberation. But it was not 
completed until Germany was united and German nationalism was assuming 
a more muscular form. The designer and prime mover of the project, Ernst 
von Bandel, had repeatedly failed to find the necessary finance. He finally 
succeeded by raising subscriptions from schools throughout the German 
empire. Hermann was unveiled in 1875, a fitting symbol of the Empire's 
new-found pride. 

In the heyday of nationalism, every self-respecting nation felt honour- 
bound to find heroes suitable for commemoration; and public monuments 
served a definite social and educational purpose. The Hermannsdenkmal led 
the field in a special pseudo-historical genre that swept Europe. 1 In Germany 
it had several rivals, including the Niederwaldsdenkmal on the banks of the 
Rhine, the equestrian statue of Emperor William I on the Kyffhauser 
Mountain in Thuringia, and the Volkerschlachtdenkmal (1913), which was 




erected by a league of patriots in Leipzig on the centenary of the Battle of 
the Nations. In time and spirit, it closely resembles the statue to that most 
unparliamentary of kings, Richard Cceur de Lion, erected beside the Houses 
of Parliament in London, the Grunwald monument (1910) in Cracow, and 
the monument to Vercingetorix on the Plateau de Gergovie near Clermont- 
Ferrand. 

Perhaps the ultimate in the political aesthetics of national sentiment can 
be found in the monument to Prince Llewellyn's dog, Gelert, which was 
erected at Beddgelert (Gelert's Grave) in North Wales in the 1790s. 2 The 
greater the pathos, the remoter the time, and the more the Romantic 
generation enthuse over these reminders of their roots. 


Polish activities in 1848 were dampened by the fiasco of an intended general 
rising two years earlier, when the Republic of Cracow had sealed its fate by not 
controlling the revolutionaries. Thousands of nobles had been massacred in the 
surrounding Galician countryside by peasants abetted by Austrian officials. 
Poland's contribution to the 'springtime of other nations', therefore, was one 
minor disturbance in Posnania, two outbursts in Cracow and Lemberg, and a 
major contingent of exiles, headed by General Jozef Bern, which fought for 
Hungary. 

In January 1863, the Congress Kingdom erupted once more, frustrated by the 
contradictions of the 'Tsar Liberator', Alexander II. Whilst emancipating the 
serfs of his Empire, Alexander was not prepared to grant the Poles a constitution. 
Two years of patriotic demonstrations in Warsaw led by priests, pastors, and 
rabbis ended with the formation of a secret National Government. Sixteen 
months of fierce guerrilla warfare ended with the executions of the insurgent 
leaders on the walls of the citadel. On this occasion the Congress Kingdom itself 
was suppressed. Eighty thousand Poles made the terrible journey to Siberia-the 
largest of all political contingents in tsarist history. 

In 1905 the torch of patriotic insurrection was taken up by the Polish 
Socialist Party. Waves of strikes and street battles in Warsaw and Lodz long 
outlasted the contemporary Russian revolt in St Petersburg. Huge conscriptions 
of sullen young men from the Polish provinces filled the ranks of the Russian 
army, fighting with no great conviction against the Japanese in Manchuria. 




The persistent defeats of Polish nationalism fostered two important 
developments. Later generations of patriots often chose to work for their country 
rather than fight for it. Their concept of 'organic work' aimed to strengthen 
economic and cultural resources, and to curb all political demands beyond local 
autonomy. This became the standard strategy for all national movements whose 
military and diplomatic support was deficient. At the same time, 'integral 
nationalism 5 made its appearance in each of the nationalities of the Polish lands. 
Lithuanian, Byelorussian, Ukrainian, and Zionist Jewish nationalism each took a 
stance which effectively paralysed any sense of a common struggle. Dmowski's 
Polish nationalists fiercely contested Pilsudski's Polish independence movement. 
Its slogans demanding a 'Poland for the Poles' revealed deep anti-German, anti- 
Ukrainian, and antisemitic complexes. 

Within the Russian Empire, important gradations could be seen in official 
attitudes to the rising tide of nationalism. Byelorussians and Ukrainians were 
simply not permitted to possess a separate identity. Poles, until 1906, were not 
permitted any form of political expression. Yet in the Grand Duchy of Finland, 
Finns enjoyed the autonomy of which many of their neighbours were deprived. 
The Baltic Germans, largely Futherans, enjoyed the religious and cultural 
toleration that was denied the other inhabitants of the Baltic provinces. 'The 
prison of the nations' had many bars, and many holes in the wall. 

The national question in Austria-Hungary was particularly recondite. The 
Ausgleich of 1867 was intended to moderate the problems; in practice it rendered 
them insoluble. There was no chance that the German-speaking elite could, 
impose its culture throughout Austria, let alone extend it to the whole of the 
Dual Monarchy. After all, 'Austria was a Slav house with a German facade'. In 
practice the three 'master races'-the Germans, the Magyars, and the Galician 
Poles- were encouraged to lord it over the others. The administrative structures 
were so tailored that the German minority in Bohemia could hold down the 
Czechs, the Magyars in Hungary could hold down the Slovaks, Romanians, and 
Croats, and the Poles in Galicia could hold down the Ruthenians (Ukrainians). 
So pressures mounted as each of the excluded nationalities fell prey to the 
charms of nationalism. What is more, when Habsburg politics were complicated 
by the introduction first of the Reichsrat or 'Imperial Council' and eventually, in 
1896, of universal suffrage, the three ruling groups could only maintain their 
supremacy by an endless game of deals and compromises. The Austrian 
Germans, who dominated the court and army, could only fend off the fiery 
Magyars by upholding the interests of ultra-conservative Polish aristocrats from 



Galicia. As a result, the Poles remained the most staunchly Kaisertreu element to 
the end. The Magyars were eternally dissatisfied; German opinion in Austria was 
increasingly drawn back to the old idea of a Greater Germany, and the Czechs in 
particular felt hopelessly trapped. Francis-Joseph I (r. 1848-1916), who 
described himself as 'the last monarch of the old style', ruled over a truly 
multinational state, where the imperial hymn could be sung in any one of 
seventeen official languages, including Yiddish. He was popular exactly because 
of his political immobility. Under the surface, the untreated ills were starting to 
fester. As one Prime Minister was ready to admit: 'It is my policy to keep all the 
nationalities in the Monarchy in a balanced state of well-modulated 
dissatisfaction.'- [genes] 

Europe was filled with national movements which do not feature in the 
textbooks. Many of the smaller communities willingly confined themselves to 
cultural tasks. In Provence, Frederic Mistral (1830-1914) was able to organize 
the revival of Provencal language and culture and yet be elected to the French 
Academy. In Wales, the custom of an annual Eisteddfod or bardic meeting was 
revived in 1819 after centuries of abeyance. The pseudo-druidical ceremonies 
initiated at Llangollen in 1858 became an essential feature of the series. In 
Germany, Slavonic Polabs, Sorbs, and Kashubs, resurrected their ancient 
Slavonic cultures. The Polabs had survived in a tiny enclave round Liichow near 
Hanover; a collection of their literature and a grammar-book were published 
with Russian assistance in 1871. The Sorbs of Lusatia, who numbered perhaps 
200,000, established a Macica or 'cultural society' at Budisyn (Bautzen) in 1847. 
The Kashubs of Pomerania did likewise. 

Both constitutional and autocratic systems could prove hostile to national 
aspirations. In this respect the experience of the Irish and the Ukrainians is 
worthy of comparison; the political arithmetic was stacked against both of them. 

The Irish participated in a prominent 'Western democracy'. From 1801, 
when the Union of Ireland and Great Britain was enacted, over fifty Irish MPs 
sat in the British Parliament at Westminster. It gave them all sorts of benefits 
except the one they most desired-control over their own affairs. But their 
political activities were incessant. The Catholic Association of Daniel O'Connell 
(1775-1847), which organized huge 'monster' public meetings for years, 
achieved religious toleration in 1829. Discontent was later kept on the boil by 
the sufferings of the Famine, by the injustices of successive Land Acts, and by 


the lack of political progress. The complacency of English Conservatives, the 
tenacious resistance of the Ulster Protestants, and the violent exploits of the Irish 
radical wing, which was represented by the Fenians (Irish Republican 
Brotherhood, from 1858) and by Sinn Fein (from 1905), made for political 
deadlock. In the Irish countryside the long-running war between government- 
backed landlords and the rebellious tenants of the Fand Feague (1879) created a 
pervasive climate of fear. Even when C. S. Parnell (1846-91) and his Irish party 
at Westminster gained the support of Gladstone's ruling Fiberals, three 
successive bills for Irish Home Rule were blocked in the House of Fords. The 
true cultural awakening of the Irish occurred late, in the 1890s, when the Irish 
Fiterary Theatre, the Gaelic Athletic Association, and the Gaelic Feague were all 
founded, 'On the necessity for de-anglicising the Irish People'. In 1900 Queen 
Victoria visited Dublin for the first time in forty years, rescinded the ban on 'the 
wearing of the green', and encouraged massive St Patrick's Day parades 
throughout the Empire. But it was too late for symbolic gestures. In 1912, when 
a fourth Home Rule Bill was prepared, both the Ulster Volunteers in Belfast and 
the National Volunteers in Dublin raised formidable armies. As Europe 
approached the Great War, Ireland stood on the brink of civil war. Ireland was 
indeed divided. Ulster, defiant, had no sense of Irishness. 'Ireland is not a 
nation,' said a future British prime minister, 'but two peoples separated by a 
deeper gulf than that dividing Ireland from Great Britain.'- Sinn Fein, which 
had always looked to the USA for support, now sought aid from Germany.

GENES 

Ln 1866 Father Gregor Mendel (1811-84), abbot of the Augustinian I 
monastery at Brno in Moravia, published the findings of his experiments into 
the propagation of the common green pea, Pisum sativum. For several years 
the abbot had been observing the peas in the monastery garden. By careful 
cross-pollination, and by concentrating on just a few specific characteristics 
such as height and colour, he was able to demonstrate definite patterns of 
inheritance in successive plant generations. He established the existence of 
dominant and recessive characteristics whose recurrence in hybrids he could 
empirically predict. His results were totally ignored. The 'Mendelian Faws 





of Inheritance', which form the starting point of modern genetics, were 
separately rediscovered in 1900 by three different biologists. 1 

Mendelism remained in the experimental stage for many decades. 
Although the presence of chromosomes in living cells was established early 
in the twentieth century, the mechanics of the genes, or 'unit-characters', as 
Mendel had called them, long defied the researchers. The significance of 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was not realized until 1944, and the double¬ 
helical spiral structure of the DNA molecule not demonstrated until 1953. In 
this regard, biology lagged well behind the corresponding advances in 
modern physics and chemistry. 

In the mean time, a Soviet scientist claimed to have solved many of the 
fundamental problems. Troflon Denisovich Lysenko (1898-1976) rejected 
the chromosomal basis of heredity, arguing instead that inheritable changes 
could be induced in plants by environmental influences and by grafting. He 
published experimental results showing that the germination of wheat seed 
could be dramatically improved by subjection to low temperature. He even 
tried to make wheat plants produce rye seed. It was all a scam: his results 
had been falsified. But having persuaded Stalin that his theories would 
remedy the failures of Soviet agriculture, Lysenko shaped himself a dazzling 
career that flourished for three decades. Elected President of the Lenin 
Academy of Agricultural Science in 1938, he ordered millions of acres to be 
sown with grain treated by his methods. When the grain failed to sprout, the 
farmers were arrested for sabotage. Critics, including Russia's leading 
geneticist N. I. Vavrilov, were cast into the Gulag. Teachers had to present 
Lysenkoism as gospel. Soviet biology was blighted almost beyond repair. 
Lysenko received two Stalin Prizes, the Order of Lenin and the title Hero of 
the USSR. 2 

Western biologists treated Lysenko as 'illiterate'. In return, Lysenko 
derided all orthodox geneticists as 'reactionary decadents grovelling before 
Western capitalism'. Foremost among the targets of his scorn was Father 
Gregor Mendel. 3 


The Ukrainians lived under two 'Eastern autocracies'. Once subjects of 
Poland, they were now subjects either of Russia or of Austria. An 




overwhelmingly peasant people, their level of national consciousness was 
necessarily low until the bonds of serfdom were severed in mid-century. 
Traditionally known as Rusini or 'Ruthenians', they now began to adopt the 
'Ukrainian' label in reaction to the misleading and insulting designation of'Little 
Russians', which tsarist officialdom had invented for them. (A Ukrainian simply 
meant a politically conscious Ruthene.) Their cultural awakening was greatly 
stimulated by the poetic writings of Taras Shevchenko (1814-61); their political 
awakening gathered pace in later decades. In Russia they were faced by a regime 
which refused to recognize their existence, regarding them as a regional Russian 
minority, and allowing them only one religion-Russian Orthodoxy. In Austria, 
where they enjoyed greater cultural and political freedom they preserved the 
Uniate Rite, and were slow to adopt the Ukrainian label. At the turn of the 
century, they organized Ruthenian schooling on a large scale. But there they 
were faced by a strong Polish community, which held the numerical majority in 
Galicia as a whole, including Lemberg, [ukraina] 


FAMINE 

Between 1845 and 1849 Ireland suffered one of Europe's worst natural 
disasters. The Irish potato famine caused a million deaths, drove over a 
million more to emigrate, and reduced the island's population of 8.2 million 
(1845) by at least a quarter. Although Ireland was an integral part of the 
United Kingdom, the most powerful state of the era, she received little 
effective relief. To some observers, it was the ultimate Malthusian 
apocalypse: to others, the culmination of centuries of misrule. 1 

The immediate cause of the disaster lay in the fungal blight phytoph- 
thora infestans, which decimated the potato crop in three successive years. 
The blight had been noted in the Isle of Wight a year before it crossed the 
Irish Sea in 1845. In England it was a minor nuisance, in Ireland the agent of 
death. 

By the early nineteenth century, large sections of Ireland's rural 
population had become totally dependent on a 'potato culture'. A vegetable 
rich in vitamins and protein, it grew easily in the moist Irish earth. It 
sustained large numbers of poor people who were left with too much time 




for singing, dancing, drinking poteen, and telling stories. They had as many 
names for potatoes as the English had for roses. They called it the murphy, 
the spud, the tater, the pratie, and the 'precarious exotic'. 

Potato dependency was the product of many disorders. In the six decades 
after 1780, Ireland experienced a demographic explosion-an increase of 
nearly 300 per cent as compared with 88 per cent in England and Wales. Yet, 
with the exception of Ulster, she experienced little industrialization to absorb 
the surplus numbers, though emigration to the USA and Australia began 
after the Napoleonic Wars. Most seriously, Irish society was clamped by a 
body of repressive legislation, which blocked many obvious solutions to her 
distress. Conditions on the land had been atrocious for longer than anyone 
remembered. Until 1829, Catholic Irishmen were not even allowed to buy 
land, and few had money to do so. Anglo-Irish landlords, often absentees, 
demanded high rents or deliveries in kind on pain of instant eviction. 
Evictions were enforced by the military, who customarily razed or 'tumbled' 
the houses of defaulters. Irish peasants had no security, and little incentive to 
work. They frequently murdered their persecutors, or joined the British 
army. In the words of the Duke of Wellington, 'Ireland was an inexhaustible 
nursery for the finest soldiers'. But it was also the home of squalor-with 
large ragged families living in mud huts with no furniture and the company 
of pigs. As a German traveller remarked: 'it seems that the poorest among 
the Letts, Esthonians and Finnlanders lead a life of comparative comfort'. 2 

A generous Irish historian writes that the initial policies of Sir Robert 
Peel's government 'were more effective than sometimes allowed'. 3 In 1846 
prices were controlled, Indian meal distributed, and public works started to 
provide employment. But Peel's fall over Corn Law repeal ushered in a 
Whig ministry that did not believe in intervention. 'Rotten potatoes have 
done it all,' exclaimed the Iron Duke. Irishmen paid their rent, and ate 
nettles. 

In 1847, 3 million public soup rations were served. But they did not stop 
typhus, or the crowds fleeing the countryside. In the district of Skibbereen in 
County Cork, where a dozen landlords took £50,000 in rent, there were 
corpses in the fields and children dying in the workhouse; and grain was still 
being exported under guard to England. Robber bands pillaged the country 
towns. 'What we have to contend with', said the Treasury Minister 
responsible for relief, 'is not the physical evil of the famine but the moral 



evil of the selfish, perverse and turbulent character of the people.' 4 

In 1848 the potato crop failed again, and the human exodus swelled to a 
flood. Ragged families garnered their last strength to walk to the ports. 
Landlords often paid for them to go. They collapsed on the roads, perished 
in the overcrowded steerage holds, and died in droves on the docks of New 
York and Montreal. They landed racked with fever, stomach cramps, and 
anglophobia. 

The famine put an end to Daniel O'Connell's campaign to reject the 
Union. But it also killed any real hopes of reconciliation. And the exodus 
continued: 

A million a decade! Calmly and cold 
The units are read by our statesman sage. 

Little they think of a Nation old, 

Fading away from History's page: 

-Outcast weeds by a desolate sea 
Fallen leaves of Humanity! 5 

This was not Europe's last famine. It was followed in 1867-8 by similar 
catastrophes in Finland and in Belgium. Nor was it on the scale of the Volga 
famine of 1921 or in the nature of the terror-famine in Ukraine of 1932-3 
[harvest]. But it was shameful for where and how it happened. The British 
government's final relief measure, in August 1849, was to send Queen 
Victoria and Prince Albert on a state visit to Dublin. 


In both empires, then, the Ukrainians had to contend with the fact that their 
homeland was inhabited by several other nationalities-Poles, Jews, and 
Russians-all of whom were hostile to Ukrainian nationalism. It was frustrating, 
to say the least. The potential membership of the Ukrainian nation was as 
numerous as the French or the English. Yet nowhere could they bring their 
numbers to bear. Like the Irish, they remained a stateless nation. Like the Irish, 
their activists began to look to Germany. 

Balkan nationalism grew specially intense. The Ottoman Empire had always 
tolerated a large measure of religious and cultural autonomy, whilst extirpating 
political dissidence. Assimilation into the ruling Muslim culture, except in 
Bosnia, Albania, and parts of Bulgaria, was low. As a result, ready-made 




Christian nations were waiting to emerge as soon as Ottoman power receded. 
Typically, they enjoyed a long period of practical autonomy, subject to the 
presence of nominal Ottoman garrisons, prior to acquiring absolute sovereignty. 
They also tended to start life on a minimal territorial base, which failed to satisfy 
their aspirations, and which led to repeated conflicts with their neighbours. None 
of them possessed even the semblance of ethnic homogeneity. Greece won its 
formal independence in 1832, the Romanian principalities (Wallachia and 
Moldavia) in 1856, Montenegro in i860, Serbia and Bulgaria in 1878. The 
Albanians, the only predominantly Muslim nation in the region, lacked the 
support of the Christian powers, and were kept waiting until 1913. (See 
Appendix III, p. 1302.) [shqiperia] 

The Greeks' experience was not felicitous, least of all with their monarchs. 
In seven reigns between 1833 and 1973, there were five abdications. The first 
King of the Hellenes, Otto I of Bavaria (r. 1833-62), a Catholic enthusiast for 
Germanic efficiency, proved more unpopular than the Ottomans. The second, 
George I (r. 1864-1913), was imported from Denmark to found an accident- 
prone dynasty. Nationalism and foreign kings did not mix. The Serbian 
experience was no happier: the blood feud between the rival dynasties of 
Karadordevic and Obrenovic fuelled ten royal assassinations. Russian support 
aroused a strong reaction from Austria, especially since the Slavs of the Dual 
Monarchy were increasingly impressed by the Serbian example. Serbia's success 
in the Balkan Wars finally pushed Vienna into a show-down. 

Unfortunately, the ethnic mosaic of the Balkans impeded the creation of 
stable national states. 'Balkanization' became a byword for political 
fragmentation, petty-minded nationalism, and vicious feuds. In the three Balkan 
wars of the early twentieth century, the Christian successor states fought no less 
eagerly among themselves than against the retreating Turks (see below). 

Historians must also address the problem of why, in a continent brimming 
with popular nationalisms, a number of countries did not follow the general 
trend. Why, for example, did an effective national movement fail to develop in 
nineteenth-century Scotland? The Scots, after all, were exposed to intense 
modernization at an early date; and as junior partners within the United 
Kingdom they could easily have found early cause to resent English domination. 
But they did not. The answer must lie partly in the divisions between the Gaelic 
and the Lowland elements within Scottish culture, which impeded the growth of 
a common identity, and partly in the powerful attractions of British state 



nationalism. Like Cardiff or Belfast, Scotland's principal city, Glasgow, thrived 
mightily from the enterprises of the British Empire. Scotland's attachment to a 
successful Union would not decline until the Empire itself began to fade. The 
pioneer bard of Scottish nationalism, Hugh MacDiarmid (1892-1978), did not 
start to write until the 1920s. The key political tract of the movement, Tom 
Nairn's Break-up of Britain, was not published until 1977.- 

In the meantime, one of the most prescient observers concluded that 
nationalism was no more than a phase. Speaking in 1882, Ernest Renan made the 
startling observation that no state or nation was eternal. Sooner or later all would 
be supplanted by something else, 'possibly a European confederation'. 
Metternich had once said, Tor me Europe has long held the essence of a 
fatherland.'- The hope was planted that such sentiments might some day return 
in more practical form. 

Socialism, like Nationalism, was a collectivist creed. It opposed the exploiters 
and manipulators for the protection not just of the individual but of society as a 
whole. It took its name from the idea of fellowship or, in the modern idiom 
'solidarity '-socius in Latin meaning 'companion'. It maintained that the poor, 
weak and oppressed could not be guaranteed a tolerable life except by the 
pooling of resources, by the equitable distribution of wealth, and by the 
subordination of individual rights to the common good. Unlike liberalism, it did 
not fear the modern state; on the contrary, it looked to the state as the arbiter and 
often as the prime mover of compassionate measures. Socialism was to be 
directed against oppressors both at home and abroad. The feeling of international 
solidarity made it the natural opponent of nationalism. Nineteenth-century 
socialism is generally considered to have drawn its strength from four separate 
sources: from Christian socialism, from the trade union movement, from the co¬ 
operative movement, and from the 'utopian' socialist theorists. (See Appendix 
III, p. 1308.) 

Without ever using the label, Christian socialism had a centuries-old 
tradition. Christian doctrine had always urged service to the community and the 
renunciation of personal wealth. The Sermon on the Mount had been regularly 
invoked to justify collectivist economic schemes, from the practical workings of 
the monastic orders to the utopias of More, Campanella, Harrington, and 
Morelli. In the nineteenth century, Protestants generally showed the most 
initiative, through figures such as J. F. D. Maurice (1805-72), first principal of 


the Working Men's College (1854), Charles Kingsley (1819-75), Adolf Wagner 
(1835-1917), or the Kaiser's preacher, Adolf Stoecker (1835-99). The Oxford 
Movement also had a socialist streak, which came out in its 'missions' to city 
slums. The Roman Catholics were more inhibited until the publication of Rerum 
novarum in 1891. In Russia, the doctrines of the Orthodox Church, the 
collectivist traditions of the peasant communes, and existence of an all-powerful 
state all furnished fertile ground for the reception of socialist ideas. 

The trade union movement grew out of the vulnerability of wage-labourers 
in the free-market economy. From the days of Dorset's Tolpuddle Martyrs, 
working men and women painfully won the right to form unions, to bargain 
collectively over pay and conditions, and to strike. The critical launch dates are 
seen as 1834 in Britain, 1864 in France, 1869 in Germany. By 1900 most 
European countries possessed an active labour movement. From the start, the 
trade unions adopted a variety of structures and ideologies. Apart from the non- 
ideological unions of the British type, there were 'horizontal' craft unions, which 
grew out of the old guilds, 'vertical' industrial unions, anarcho-syndicalist 
unions on the French or Spanish model, liberal workers' associations, pacifist 
'yellow' unions opposed both to strikes and to war, and Church-based Christian 
unions. In many countries, as in Belgium, several different types of union 
worked alongside each other. In Russia, the initiative was taken by the Tsarist 
police, who decided to outflank various illegal organizations by forming official 
unions of their own. This experiment in 'police socialism' came to a bad end on 
5 January 1905, when a demonstration headed by Father Gapon, a police agent, 
was fired on by the police. 'Bloody Sunday' launched the revolutionary outbreak 
of 1905; and Father Gapon was murdered. Russian trade unionism enjoyed 
barely one decade of independent existence before being suppressed by the 
Bolsheviks. 

The formation of co-operatives, which sought to protect their members from 
the evils of big business, took place in three main sectors-manufacturing, 
consumption, and agriculture. In 1800 the experimental textile settlement of 
New Lanark Mills was set up in Scotland by the visionary Robert Owen (1771- 
1858). It guaranteed a ten-and-a-half-hour working day and sickness insurance, 
but did not outlast its founder. In 1844 the first consumers' co-operative, the 
Rochdale Pioneers, appeared in Lancashire. Agricultural co-operatives, which 
first emerged in Germany at the initiative of F. W. Raiffeisen (1818-88), were to 
have a broad future wherever peasant farmers were free to organize, and 
especially in Eastern Europe. 



Socialist theorizing had been in progress ever since the 'Conspiracy of 
Equals' was organized in Paris in 1796 by Francois-Noel Babeuf (1760-97). 
Like Babeuf, who was executed by the Directory, all the founding theorists were 
French Utopians. They included Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint- 
Simon (1760-1825), Charles Fourrier (1772-1837), Etienne Cabet (1788-1856), 
Louis Auguste Blanqui (1805-81), Louis Blanc (1811-82), and Pierre-Joseph 
Proudhon (1809-65). Saint-Simon, a Christian socialist who had been close to 
Comte, sought to mobilize science and technology for an ideal community 
governed by experts. His Nouveau Christianisme (1825) led to the foundation of 
a sectarian Church, model communes, and trials for immorality. Both Fourrier 
and Cabet established model co-operative settlements in the USA. Fourrier's 
Theorie des Quatre Mouvements (1808) envisaged a scientifically ordered 
society, free from all government, which would ascend through various stages of 
perfection on the road to 'Harmony'. (It is often regarded as the source of 
Marx's ideas on the stages of history and the withering of the state.) 

Blanqui, known as 'l'Enferme', 'the Interned', was a Babouvian class 
conspirator, who spent a total of 33 years in prison for persistently organizing 
insurrectionary cells against monarchy and republic alike. His seizure of the 
Hotel de Ville in Paris for two days in 1839 was a disaster; but his followers 
played a leading role in the Commune of 1871. (He missed the event himself by 
being arrested the day before its outbreak.) His motto was 'Ni Dieu, ni maitre' 
(Neither God, nor boss). Louis Blanc, in contrast, argued for the creation of 
egalitarian, worker-controlled, and state-funded workshops, where the workers 
were to contribute according to their ability and be paid according to their needs. 
The scheme outlined in LOrganisation du Travail (1839) was briefly put into 
practice during the Revolution of 1848, before its author was exiled in England. 
Proudhon was in some ways the most influential of them all. His attack on 
(excessive) private property in Qu'est-ce que c'est la propriete? (1840) was a 
sensation, especially when its most famous phrase, 'Property is theft', was 
quoted out of context. His Philosophie de la Misere (1846) provoked one of 
Marx's more trenchant retorts in La Misere de la Philosophies whilst his Idee 
generale de la Revolution (1851) described a future Europe free of frontiers, 
central governments, and state laws. Proudhon was the founder of modern 
anarchism, which soon led his followers into conflict with mainstream socialism; 
but his support for direct action by workers against the state became the corner¬ 
stone of French syndicalism. 

French influences were strong in the thought of the early German socialists. 



Ferdinand Loslauer (Lassalle, 1825-64), a Silesian Jew, who was killed in a 
romantic duel after founding the first German socialist party, spent a formative 
period in Paris. The two inseparable exiles, Friedrich Engels (1820-95) and Karl 
Marx (1818-83), who met in Paris, based many of their arguments on study of 
the French Revolution. Their Communist Manifesto (1848) was well timed. 'A 
spectre is haunting Europe', it claimed, The spectre of communism. Let the 
mling classes tremble ... The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains 
... Working men of all countries, unite!' 

Marx and Engels were an odd pair. Expelled from Prussia for their radical 
journalism, they settled in England. Engels soon established himself as a 
prosperous capitalist, managing a cotton factory in Manchester. Marx eked out a 
penurious living in London, supported as a private scholar by a stipend from 
Engels. His life's work, Das Kapital (Capital, 3 vols., 1867-94) was the fruit of 
thirty years' lonely study in the Reading Room of the British Museum. It was a 
sustained exercise in speculative social philosophy, a rambling jumble of 
brilliant insights and turgid pedantry. It borrowed a number of disparate ideas 
current at the time, and reassembled them in the original combination of 
'dialectical materialism'. Marx aimed to create the same sort of universal theory 
for human society that Darwin had done for natural history; and he had hoped to 
dedicate his first volume to Darwin. He took the subject of materialist history 
from Feuerbach, the class struggle from Saint-Simon, the dictatorship of the 
proletariat (which he soon rejected) from Babeuf, the labour theory of value 
from Adam Smith, the theory of surplus value from Bray and Thompson, the 
principle of dialectical progress from Hegel. All these components were put 
together in a messianic doctrine whose psychological roots are thought to lie in 
the Judaism which his family had deserted during his childhood. Marx was the 
Prophet; the Proletariat was the Chosen People; the socialist movement was the 
Church; the Revolution was the Second Coming; Communism was the Promised 
Land.- 

Marx had little to do with practical politics. He helped found an International 
Working-men's Association, a phantom body later eulogized as The first 
International', for which he wrote a constitution and some fiery addresses. In his 
later years he attracted a substantial following among German socialists and 
their Russian disciples, but not in Britain. When he died he was buried in 
Highgate Cemetery, in a tomb which faces that of Herbert Spencer, with the 
inscription: 'Philosophers have so far explained the world in various ways: the 
point, however, is to change it.' Engels wrote up the last two volumes of Kapital 


from Marx's notes, thereby completing a joint oeuvre whose individual elements 
cannot always be disentangled. But he had ideas of his own. He was more 
familiar with social conditions than Marx, and more concerned with the practical 
implications of their theories. By expounding the 'withering of state power', his 
Anti-Duhring (1878) and The Origins of the Family, Private Property and the 
State (1884) gave great encouragement to active revolutionaries. 

Latter-day commentators tend to be rather dismissive of Marxism's 
credentials. Marx, they say, was 'illustrative of liberal Europe', or 'a typical mid- 
19th century social theorist'.- They may be right; but they miss the point. The 
intellectual rigour of Marxism proved to be far inferior to its emotive power. The 
great majority who came to believe that Marx had provided a scientific basis for 
their dreams of social justice never gave a moment's critical thought to his 
writings. Marx had unwittingly provided them with yet another substitute 
religion. 

The obvious social constituency for socialism was provided by the new 
working class. In practice, many workers steered clear; and almost all socialist 
organizations were dominated by middle-class intellectuals. The English Fabian 
society was archetypal. In Eastern Europe, where the fledgeling working class 
remained small, socialism was taken up either by internationalist conspirators, as 
in Russia, or, as in Poland, by that branch of the independence movement that 
wished to overcome the ethnic divisiveness preached by its nationalist rivals. 
Attempts to mobilize socialist movements with a mass following repeatedly 
foundered on the rocks of local interests, governmental repression, or intellectual 
frangipanery. In most countries, socialist parties of one sort or another struggled 
into existence, often after decades of frustration. It was the 1890s before a 
respectable parade of parties could be consolidated (see Appendix III, p. 1308). 
The most important, the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) was 
permanently established in 1890, after twelve years of banishment under 
Bismarck's anti-socialist law. It traced its origin to the Gotha Programme of 
1875, and to the merger of Lassalle's association with various Marxist groups. 
The Erfurt Programme of 1891 was largely formulated by Karl Kautsky (1854- 
1938), and was openly Marxist. But it was soon modified both by the revisionist 
criticisms of Eduard Bernstein (1850-1932), who rejected the apocalyptic vision 
of socialism, and by the pragmatic inclinations of party leaders in the Reichstag. 

The internationalist branch of the movement encountered similar difficulties. 
The 'First International' fell apart amidst recriminations between Marxists and 


anarchists. The 'Second International', which in 1889 succeeded in setting up a 
permanent secretariat in Brussels, was soon dominated by representatives of the 
SPD. It organized congresses, acted as a pressure group largely in the pacifist 
cause, and evaporated in 1914 when none of its national branches opposed the 
war. Its demise left the field deserted by all except the revolutionary Russian 
party, which was run by exiles like V. I. Ulyanov (Lenin, 1870-1924) and other 
like-minded conspirators. 

The Russian revolutionary tradition was as old as the autocracy which 
fuelled it. Its first incarnation in the nineteenth century broke surface with the 
Decembrists of 1825-a fraternity of army officers influenced by French and 
Polish ideas. But in subsequent decades, under the guidance of Alexander 
Herzen (1812-70) and Nikolai Chernyshevsky (1828-89), it took on 
increasingly socialist, populist, and anarchist flavours. In the 1860s and 1870s 
Russian populism- narod-nichestvo or 'the movement to the people'-saw 
starry-eyed idealists going out to the villages to convert the peasantry, only to be 
met with incomprehension. In 1879 the populists split into two wings, with one 
emphasizing agrarian and educational reform and the other, the Narodnaya 
Vol'ya or 'People's Will', advocating violence. A member of the latter 
assassinated Tsar Alexander II in 1881. 

One key figure, P. N. Tkachev (1844-85), is often overlooked in Western 
accounts. Nor was he chosen for the later Bolshevik pantheon. Yet he was the 
true precursor of bolshevism. A 'Jacobin' among the Populists and an economic 
materialist, he provided the intellectual link between Chernyshevsky and Lenin. 
He spurned the education of the masses, calling instead for the training of a 
revolutionary elite. 'The question "What should be done?" should no longer 
concern us,' he wrote in the 1870s. 'It has long since been resolved. Make the 
Revolution!' He spent his later years in exile in Switzerland, where Lenin was to 
read his works avidly whilst denouncing him in public. There were no 'filial 
ties', but a definite fellow spirit. - 

The history of Lenin's group well illustrates the impossible dilemmas forced 
on would-be socialists in a hostile setting. As exiles or illegals, they had no 
chance to practise the democratic methods of the German SPD, from whom their 
original inspiration was taken. As revolutionaries, they could appeal to a certain 
body of Russian opinion that would cheer on anyone promising to fight the Tsar. 
But as socialists, they were bound to conflict with other branches of the 
movement, notably the Social Revolutionaries or SRs, who were better attuned 


to the Empire's two largest constituencies, the peasants and the non-Russian 
nationalities. As Marxists, they had to concede that a genuine working-class 
revolution had little chance of success wherever, as in Russia, the working class 
was small; and as the group most devoted to conspiratorial methods, they were 
reluctant to organize an open, mass following. (Despite the name of Bol'sheviki 
or 'Majoritarians', which Lenin seized on at a suitable moment, they usually 
formed a minority, even within the Russian SDR) Lenin rightly suspected, like 
Tkachev, that a disciplined minority could seize power without popular support. 
Yet in trying to justify such a strategy on socialist principles he was condemned 
from the outset to cloak it in fantasy. 'Mendacity is the soul of bolshevism.'- 
Put another way, Leninism was cargo-cult socialism-a weird and distant 
imitation of the original model. 'The Marxism which prevailed in the Russian 
Revolution', comments a critic who came to be highly regarded in post- 
Communist Russia, 'bore about as much relation to the original as the 
"Christianity" of T'ai Ping to that of Thomas Aquinas.'- It has taken the best 
part of a century for this fact to be generally recognized. 

Anarchism, though passing its infancy in the company of socialism, soon grew 
up to be incompatible. At the core of anarchist thought lies the contention that all 
forms of domination are hateful, that government is not just unnecessary but 
harmful. One early strand, which could be traced to the Anabaptists and Diggers 
of the seventeenth century,- came to fruition in England in the Enquiry 
Concerning Political Justice (1793) of William Godwin (1756-1836) and in the 
soaring vision of Prometheus Unbound written by Godwin's son-in-law, Shelley: 

The loathsome mask has fallen, the man remains 
Sceptreless, free, uncircumscribed, but man 
Equal, unclassed, tribeless, and nationless, 

Exempt from awe, worship, degree, the king 
Over himself... 

And women, too, frank, beautiful and kind ... 

From custom's evil taint exempt and pure; 

Speaking the wisdom once they could not think, 

Looking emotions once they feared to feel 
And changed to all which once they dared to be, 

Yet being now, made earth like heaven .. .- 

A second strand, in France, in the work and writings of Proudhon and his 


disciple, Anselme Bellegarrigue, centred on the doctrine of mutualite 
(mutualism). This held that the workers should avoid involvement in 
parliamentary politics, and should liberate themselves by direct action on the 
streets and in the factories. 

A third strand grew from an extreme reaction against the extreme autocracy 
of the Russian Empire. It was nourished by two aristocratic Russian exiles, 
Mikhail Bakunin (1814-76) and Prince Peter Kropotkin (1842-1921). Bakunin, 
who once declared that 'the passion for destruction is also a creative urge', broke 
up Marx's First International. 'The Communists believe that they must organize 
the working class in order to seize power in states', he declared. 'Revolutionary 
socialists [meaning anarchists] organize in order to destroy states.' He was the 
inspiration of the collectivist variant of anarchism that took hold in the Latin 
countries. Kropotkin, a distinguished author and geographer, wrote The 
Conquest of Bread (1892), Fields, Factories and Workshops (1899), and Mutual 
Aid (1902) in his campaign for a communist society free from all central 
government. 

A fourth strand, initially described in Der Einzige und sein Eigentum (The 
Individual and His Property, 1845) was launched by the Berlin journalist Max 
Stirner (1806-56). It stressed the absolute rights of the individual to freedom 
from institutional control. This proved attractive to numerous avant-garde artists 
and writers, from Courbet and Pissarro to Oscar Wilde. But it also shows why 
the anarchists' own principles ruled out any chance of an effective anarchist 
organization. 

In practical terms, anarchism bore fruit in several directions. Revolutionary 
anarcho-syndicalists dominated workers' movements in France, Italy, and 
especially in Spain, where the Confederacion Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) 
developed into a major popular movement. Their favoured weapon was the 
general strike, designed to paralyse all working institutions. Peasant anarchists 
wielded influence in scattered locations from Andalusia to Ukraine. Anarchism 
also inspired the birth of modern terrorism-what the early Italian militant, 
Enrico Malatesta, called the 'propaganda of the deed'. The idea was that 
sensational acts of murder or destruction would publicize injustice, break the 
resolve of government policy, and shatter the nerve of the ruling elite. The list of 
victims included Tsar Alexander II (1881), President Sadi Carnot of France 
(1894), Empress Elizabeth of Austria (1896), Premier Canovas del Castillo of 
Spain (1897), and King Umberto I of Italy (1900). Nowhere did these violent 



preludes precipitate the peace and harmony which anarchists see as their 
ultimate destination. 

Finally, and in diametric contrast, anarchism has inspired an important 
tradition of moral protest against all forms of coercion. Starting with Count Leo 
Tolstoy, the novelist, who felt that marriage was no less coercive than tsarism, 
the gospel of non-violence has attracted many dedicated followers, from 
Mahatma Gandhi in India to the Solidarity movement in Poland and to modern 
environ-mentalism.- Bellegarrigue's famous battle-cry, 'L'Anarchie, c'est 
l'ordre', is widely dismissed as a purely negative sentiment. But it contains a 
very serious moral constituent that underlies much of the modern concern about 
the mindless juggernauts of political and technological power. It is in this sense 
that anarchism has been classed as The most attractive of political creeds'.- It 
stood at the opposite end of the political spectrum from that of the one politician, 
Bismarck, who was as central to European politics as the anarchists were 
marginal. 

Otto von Bismarck (1815-98) bestrode the Germany of the late nineteenth 
century much as the German Empire, which he designed, bestrode the rest of 
Europe. He, more than anyone else, was the architect of the European order 
which emerged from the turmoil after 1848, the year when he entered politics, 
and whose revolutions he detested. He was a man of immense contradictions 
both of personality and of policy. The 'Iron Chancellor', of fearsome 
countenance in Reichstag or diplomatic encounter, he was in private a hysteric, 
an insomniac, and, as recently revealed, a morphine addict. He was a landed 
Junker, wedded to his estates at Schonhausen and Varzin, who presided over 
Europe's mightiest programme of industrialization. He was an antiquated 
Prussian conservative and monarchist who despised his sovereign, who adopted 
the nationalism of the liberal opposition, and who gave Germany both universal 
suffrage and social insurance. He was a victorious militarist who was infinitely 
suspicious of the fruits of victory. He was the hero of so-called German 
unification who chose to keep Greater Germany divided. The key to his success 
lay in a marvellous combination of strength and restraint. He built up positions 
of great power, only to disarm his opponents with carefully graded concessions 
that made them feel relieved and secure. 'You can do everything with bayonets', 
he once said, 'except sit on them.' 

Yet Bismarck's reputation is a mixed one. No one can deny his mastery of 


the political art; but many question his morality and his intentions. For German 
patriots and conservative apologists, he was the person who gave his country, 
and his continent, an era of unparalleled stability: one has only to see what 
conflicts arose after his downfall when Wilhelm II 'dropped the pilot'. For 
liberal critics, however, he was and remains, in the words of Isaiah Berlin, 'a 
great and an evil man'. They see him as an aggressor, who used war as a 
conscious instrument of policy (and, what is worse, succeeded); as a cheat, who 
introduced democratic forms in order to preserve the undemocratic Prussian 
Establishment; as a bully, who bludgeoned his opponents with the blunt 
instruments of state power-the Catholics with the Kulturkampf, the Poles with 
the Colonization Commission, the Social Democrats with proscription. He 
would not have denied it. He believed, no doubt, that minor surgery and small 
doses of nasty medicine were well justified if major diseases were kept at bay. 
To quote a rare admirer of a leftist persuasion: 'The history of modern Europe 
can be written in terms of three Titans: Napoleon, Bismarck, and Lenin. Of these 
three... Bismarck probably did the least harm.'- 

European Jewry has played such a prominent role in modern times that its story 
has been the subject of all sorts of myths and misunderstandings, both 
sympathetic and hostile. The main lines, however, are clear. After the break-up 
of Poland-Lithuania, the only large state to have provided a safe haven in 
preceding centuries, three closely related developments took place. First, the 
Jews began a new era of migration. Secondly, they received full civil rights in 
most European countries. And thirdly, they rebelled in ever increasing numbers 
against the traditional restrictions imposed on them by their own community.- 

Jewish migration was mainly set in motion after 1773 by the Partitions of 
Poland. Jews from the western districts of Poland, in Posen or Danzig, found 
themselves to be citizens of Prussia, and free to travel without restriction to 
Berlin, Breslau, and other German cities. Jews from Galicia, who became 
Austrian citizens, began to move to other Habsburg provinces, especially to 
Bukovina, Hungary, Bohemia, and Moravia, and at a later stage to Vienna. Jews 
living in the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania or in eastern Poland found 
themselves citizens of the Russian Empire, where they were required by law to 
inhabit the Pale of Settlement. (See Appendix III, p. 1311) But the law was often 
observed in the breach; and new, dynamic Jewish communities began to form in 
the great Russian cities, particularly in St Petersburg, Moscow, Kiev, and 


Odessa. Jewish migrants who left their homes in the ultra-conservative religious 
communities of historic Poland were subject to several new trends: to the 
Haskalah or 'Jewish Enlightenment', to assimilation, and to secular Jewish 
politics. 

The scale and tempo of Jewish migration markedly increased in the second 
half of the nineteenth century. To some extent, the outflow can be explained by 
mounting demographic pressure and by the regular processes of modernization 
and urbanization. The Jewish population of Europe multiplied from about two 
millions in 1800 to about nine millions in 1900. But persecution, and still more 
the fear of persecution, were also factors. Under Alexander III (r. 1881-94), the 
Tsarist government sought to enforce the laws of the Pale. In the ensuing 
stampede, the distinction between migrants and refugees was often lost. 
Hundreds of thousands of Jews left Russia for good, heading for Western Europe 
and the USA. [pogrom] 

Jewish migration was greatly assisted by the growing circle of European 
states where Jews enjoyed full civic rights. Here, the lead had been taken by 
revolutionary France, where on 27 September 1791 the Convention granted 
citizenship to all Jews swearing an oath of loyalty. The initiative had been taken 
by the Convention's President, the Abbe Gregoire (1750-1831), who regarded 
the equal treatment of Jews as part of his Christian duty. During the debate, the 
Marquis de Clermont-Tonnerre had made the famous distinction: 'The Jews 
must be refused everything as a separate nation, and be granted everything as 
individuals.'- Henceforth, the legal emancipation of Jews became a standard 
article of European liberalism, and was gradually introduced almost everywhere 
except for the Russian Empire. (See Appendix III, p. 1295.) 

Yet Jewish emancipation was a double-edged operation. It required a 
fundamental change in the conduct and the attitudes both of the host societies 
and of the Jews themselves. It demanded the dismantling not only of the 
constraints imposed on Jews from outside but also of the 'internal ghetto' in 
Jewish minds. Modern concern with the roots of anti-Semitism sometimes 
overlooks the severity of the Jews' own laws of segregation. Observant Jews 
could not hold to the 613 rules of dress, diet, hygiene and worship if they tried to 
live outside their own closed community, and intermarriage was strictly 
forbidden. Since Judaic law taught that Jewishness was biologically inherited in 
the maternal line, Jewish women were jealously protected. A girl who dared to 
marry out could expect to be disowned by her family, and ritually pronounced 


dead. Extreme determination was needed to withstand such acute social 
pressures. It is not surprising that Jews who rejected their religion often turned to 
extreme alternatives, including atheism and communism. 

The Haskalah, which first appeared in Berlin, was associated with the name 
of Moses Mendelsohn (1729-86) the prototype of Lessing's 'Nathan der Weise'. 
A natural outgrowth of the Enlightenment which had been at work in the 
Christian world for some time, it sought to modify the exclusively religious 
content of Jewish education, and to give Jews access to the mainstream of 
European culture. Its disciples, known as maskilim or 'men of understanding', 
found some adherents in the shtetlakh further east, especially in Galicia, where 
German-language Jewish secular schools began to open. A ban on the maskilim 
pronounced in 1816 by the Rabbi of Lemberg revealed the anxiety of Orthodox 
Jewish leaders. 

In due course the limited educational ideals of the early Haskalah were 
extended. Some Jewish leaders began to advocate full-scale assimilation, 
whereby Jews were urged to participate in all branches of public life. This trend 
sought to confine Jewish practices to the private circles of family and 
synagogue, and to turn out Jews who were otherwise indistinguishable from their 
co-citizens. In so doing it broke many of the traditional taboos, and necessitated 
the foundation of Reformed Judaism, a new denomination which appeared in 
Germany in 1825. Reformed Judaism sought to reconcile the principles of 
Jewish religion with the demands of life in a modern society; its adherents were 
not required to observe the same degree of rules and restrictions. It became the 
norm for the majority of migrant Jews in Western Europe and the USA, but did 
not affect the great mass of traditional Jewish communities in Central and 
Eastern Europe. 


POGROM 

In April 1881 the town of Yelizavetgrad in Ukraine was the scene of an 
organized pogrom. It was the opening outrage in a wave of attacks over the 
next three years against Jewish communities in Kiev, Odessa, Warsaw, and 
Nizhni Novgorod. Frightened by the assassination of Tsar Alexander II, the 
Russian authorities did little to deter reactionary societies and town mobs 




from turning the Jews into a public scapegoat. Pogrom was an old Russian 
word meaning 'round-up' or 'lynching'. It was used to denote a coordinated 
assault by one ethnic group against another, and had been applied to many 
sorts of victims, including Armenians and Tartars. After 1881 it gained the 
special connotation of assaults on Jews. 1 

A second wave of pogroms occurred in 1903-6. Official propaganda 
made a point of associating Jews with revolutionary troublemakers. Forty- 
five people died in Kishinev (1903), 300 in Odessa (1905), and 80 in 
Bialystok. In all, over 800 casualties were sustained in incidents across the 
Empire. 

The third wave, in 1917-21, far exceeded all previous horrors. An initial 
massacre at Novgorod Severski was perpetrated by the Red Army, which 
had invented the slogan 'Beat the bourgeoisie and the Jews'. Ukrainian 
nationalist and Russian 'White' forces proved themselves still more 
merciless. Denikin's army flaunted the slogan Biy zhyda, spassiy Rossiyu, 
'Thrash a Jew and save Russia'. 1,700 were killed at Proskirov (1919), 1,500 
at Fastov (September 1919) and 4,000 at Tetiev. Total Jewish casualties 
exceeded 60,000. How far they were victims of civil war, or exclusively of 
antisemitism, is another matter. 2 

On the night of 22-3 November 1918, just after the Polish army had 
recaptured Lwow (Lemberg) from the Ukrainians (see p. 921), riots were 
sparked in several sections of the city, where the Polish soldiery claimed to 
have been fired on. In the ensuing bloodbath an estimated 374 persons lost 
their lives, 55 of them Jews. Three Allied missions disagreed about the 
causes. Could antisemitism have lain at the heart of a massacre where the 
great majority of the victims were Christians? None the less, the 
Lembergerpogrom was widely reported, and 'Pogroms in Poland' became 
one of the post-war headlines. The worst atrocities had been perpetrated 
elsewhere. But, not for the last time, Poland bore the brunt of the adverse 
publicity. 3 [lyczakoW] 


In Western Europe, and in some of the larger centres of the East, the 
combination of legal relaxations and of growing Jewish assimilationism created 
unprecedented opportunities. Jewish names appeared ever more frequentiy on 




the lists of financiers, lawyers, doctors, writers, scholars, artists, and politicians 
of the age. It was an era, in the words of one of its beneficiaries, Sigmund Freud, 
when 'every industrious Jewish schoolboy carried a Cabinet Minister's portfolio 
in his satchel'. Important landmarks were reached in Britain, for example, when 
in 1841 the City of London elected Baron Lionel de Rothschild as its 
(disqualified) Member of Parliament, and in 1868, when Disraeli emerged as 
Europe's first Jewish Prime Minister. 

To be exact, Benjamin Disraeli (1804-81), Earl of Beaconsfield, grandson of 
a Sephardi immigrant from Venice, would have counted himself in the category 
of ex-Jews. Having been baptized with his entire family into the Anglican 
communion, he had broken for ever with Judaism, which, his father said, 'cuts 
off the Jews from the great family of mankind'. 'Yes,' he told his friends, 'I have 
climbed to the top of the greasy pole.' 

Yet, as Disraeli's career well illustrates, the success of assimilation posed a 
threat to the very existence of a Jewish community. If all Jews had followed his 
example, all would soon have become ex-Jews. As a result, as migration and 
assimilation accelerated, a serious reaction set in. The onset of Jewish 
nationalism (Zionism), first in cultural and later in political form, was part of the 
Europe-wide nationalist trend; but it was boosted by anxieties born of 
specifically Jewish experiences. Cultural Zionism appeared in the work of the 
so-called Hebrew Revival, which succeeded in transforming Hebrew from a 
'dead', liturgical language into a vehicle for modern literary and political usage. 
Its pioneers included the Galician satirist Jozef Perl (1774-1839), the philologist 
I. B. Levinsohn (1788-1860) of Krzemieniec, the historian Nachman Krochmal 
(1785-1840) of Tarnopol, and the poet Jehudeh Loeb Gordon (1830-92) of 
Wilno, author of Hakitzah Ammi (Awake, my people). It was important in 
founding the brand of secular Jewish culture which was to be adopted a century 
later in Israel; but it enjoyed only marginal influence in Europe. 

The opposing Yiddish Revival occurred at a slightly later date. In 1897, 90 
per cent of Jews in the Pale and in Galicia still spoke Yiddish as their mother 
tongue. The Hasidim used it widely in written form, but only for religious 
purposes. At the turn of the century, Yiddish written in Hebrew characters was 
promoted by leaders opposed both to Zionism and to assimilationist education in 
Polish, Russian, or German. For 40 or 50 years it gave life to a thriving press, a 
lively collection of belles-lettres, and a secular school system supported in 
particular by the Bund. Its best known practitioners were I. L. Peretz (1852- 



1915) of Zamoac" and Isaac Bashevis Singer (1904-92), both of whom began 
their careers as Polish writers. 

Political Zionism differed from other manifestations of European nationalism 
mainly in the fact that its sacred national soil lay outside Europe. Otherwise, it 
possessed all the characteristics of the other national movements of the day-a 
dedicated, visionary elite; a complex ideology based on nationalist 
interpretations of history and culture; a wide spectrum of political opinions; a 
mass clientele that still needed to be convinced; a full panoply of enemies; and, 
at the outset, no obvious chance of practical success. It began in the 1860s with 
the first attempts to send Jewish colonists to Palestine. One of the colonist 
associations, Hoveve Zion (Friends of Zion), obtained financial support in 1882 
from Baron Edmund de Rothschild. Their first federal conference was held at 
Kattowitz (Katowice) in Silesia two years later; and a united World Zionist 
Organization (WZO) was created at the congress at Basle in Switzerland in 
1897. The movement's founding fathers consisted largely of independent- 
minded Polish rabbis such as Zvi Hirsch Kalischer (1795-1874) of Thorn or 
Samuel Mohilever (1824-98) of Biafystok. But leadership of the WZO fell to 
lay activists, headed by the Budapest-born journalist Theodore Herzl (1860- 
1904) and later by figures such as David Wolfson (1856-1914), a Cologne 
banker, and Chaim Weizmann (1874-1952), an academic chemist working in 
Manchester. Zionist ideology can be traced to Krochmal's A Guide to the 
Perplexed (1851), but received its most persuasive texts in the tract 
Autoemancipation (1882) written by Dr Leo Pinsker, a physician from Odessa, 
and in Herzl's Der Judenstaat (1896). 

From the start, deep divisions separated the religious wing of Zionism, the 
Mizrachi or 'spiritual centre', from the dominant secular nationalists. Bitter 
differences also separated the socialist wing, based on the Poalei Zion (Workers 
of Zion) party of David Gruen, alias Ben-Gurion (1886-1973), who was born at 
Plock on the Vistula, from the integral Jewish nationalists, who duly emerged in 
the Zionist Revisionist grouping of Vladimir Jabotinsky (1880-1940). The one 
thing which they shared was the conviction that life for Jews in Europe was 
becoming less and less tolerable. For the time being the future of Zionism turned 
on three great imponderables-the fluctuating levels of antisemitism, the 
radicalization of the Jewish masses in Eastern Europe, and negotiations for a 
suitable tract of land. No Zionist could yet feel confident of an early solution. 
Negotiations for the acquisition of a Zionist homeland produced few results. 
Herzl's audiences with the Ottoman Sultan in 1901-2 did not bear fruit; and in 



1903 the British offer of a land grant in the Kenyan highlands of East Africa split 
the WZO from top to bottom. This last experience strengthened the conviction 
that the Zionist dream could not be divorced from the historic 'land of Israel' in 
Palestine. No progress could be made on that front until the British conquest of 
Jerusalem in 1916, and the Balfour Declaration which followed. 

Antisemitism in the sense of 'Jew-hatred' had been endemic throughout 
European history. Its causes have been classified as religious, economic, social, 
and cultural. But it is essentially a vicious psychological syndrome, where the 
stereotyping of Jews precedes accusations of conspiracy and treachery. It turned 
the Jewish community into the archetypal scapegoat for all sorts of ills. Its 
embers were always alight, bursting into flame and dying down in patterns that 
are not easily explained. In the late nineteenth century, however, it was fanned 
by the migrations which brought many Europeans into contact with Jews for the 
first time, by adverse social conditions, especially in the burgeoning cities, and 
by the rising tide of nationalism, which made many people less tolerant of ethnic 
and cultural diversity. It came to the surface in the Russian pogroms, in the 
Dreyfus Affair in France, and in the sinister invention of the 'Protocols of the 
Elders of Zion'.- 

On the other hand, liberal opinion held that patience and education would 
eliminate the prevailing frictions. Well-integrated Jewish communities, such as 
that represented by the Anglo-Jewish Association in London, decried what they 
saw as the Zionists' desire to exaggerate antisemitism for political ends. In 1911 
the view was expressed by the Encyclopaedia Britannica, for instance, that 
'With the passing away of anti-Semitism, Jewish nationalism will disappear'.- 
It could not have been more mistaken. For both antisemitism and Jewish 
nationalism were due to increase. To a degree, they fed off each other. What 
could not have been easily predicted was that antisemitism, which was 
widespread in those countries, such as Russia, Poland, and Ukraine, where Jews 
were most numerous, would assume its most virulent form in Germany and 
Austria, where Jews were relatively few. 

Radical Jewish politics thrived particularly among the Jewish masses of the 
East. Zionism was only one of the competing trends. Revolutionary communism, 
which condemned all forms of nationalism, including Zionism, gained a large 
number of Jewish, or rather ex-Jewish, recruits. They formed an important 
segment of the phenomenon which one of their number defined as 'the non- 
Jewish Jew'.- The socialist Jewish Workers' League or Bund, which aimed to 


improve conditions for Jews within the societies where they actually lived, 
opposed both Zionists and communists. 

There remains the fascinating puzzle of why Europe's Jews should have 
made such a formidable contribution to all aspects of European culture and 
achievement. This development of the period aroused both envy and admiration, 
and has generated a wide variety of speculation. Jewish prowess undoubtedly 
touched the raw nerves of the last-ditch defenders of Europe's Christian 
civilization, and of those inadequates who felt threatened by the success of 
'rootless cosmopolitans' and 'aliens'. In retrospect, however, it can reasonably 
be connected to the psychological drives mobilized in families struggling to 
overcome both the rejection of the closed Jewish communities which they had 
left and the suspicions of the predominantly Christian society where they strove 
to gain acceptance. It was clearly related, too, to the Jewish passion for 
education, which was rooted in the study of the Torah, but which could be easily 
redirected to the early acquisition of foreign languages, of legal qualifications, or 
of scientific expertise. It must also be related to the expanding frontiers of 
knowledge and communications, where people with international contacts stood 
at an advantage over their homegrown confreres. For talented individuals, the 

right measure of insecurity could prove positively beneficial. [e=mc*] [wiener 
WELT] 

Most Jews, of course, did not either shine or thrive. Statistically, the greater 
part of European Jewry in the early twentieth century remained exactly what it 
was 100 years before-a scattered mass of poor, ultra-religious, rural 
communities huddled in the unchanging backwaters of the former Polish 
provinces. In many ways their outlook had less in common with their children 
who had migrated to the West than with the poor, ultra-religious, rural peasants 
among whom they had always lived. These downtrodden Ostjuden were the butt 
of much prejudice, not only from the locals but also from their fellow-Jews who 
had made the grade in Germany and Austria, and who had left the old Jewish 
world completely behind.- 

European Imperialism in the late nineteenth century differed from earlier forms 
of the phenomenon in several important ways. It was part of a world-wide 
scramble for control of the last remaining countries suitable for exploitation. It 
was evident that the world's resources were finite: states which set up a colonial 
empire quickly stood to gain a permanent advantage; those who delayed might 
be excluded from the 'First Division' forever. In the two decades starting in 


1875, over one-quarter of the land surface of the globe was seized by half-a- 
dozen European powers. Colonies were viewed as an integral part of the 
advanced industrial economies. The supply of raw materials, cheap labour, and 
semi-finished products was planned to maximize the benefit to the 'mother 
country 5 . There was a qualitative as well as quantitative leap in the intensity of 
exploitation. In the eyes of some, including the Marxists, the growing 
competition for colonial resources was bound to lead to international conflict. 
Lenin's Imperialism as the Highest Form of Capitalism (1916) was a typical 
work of this genre. 

Political and economic imperialism was attended by a conscious cultural 
mission to 'europeanize' the colonies in the image of the mother countries. In 
this, Christian missionaries formed an important element, though their 
relationship to the political authorities and to the commercial companies was 
rarely a direct one. Unlike their predecessors, such as the Spanish missionaries in 
the Americas, they often saw their task in broad terms, encompassing medicine, 
secular education, administrative reforms, and technological innovation. 

The imperial powers sought to exploit the military potential of the colonies. 
The introduction of colonial regiments to Europe was as strange as the earlier 
arrival of European soldiers overseas. 

As the map of the globe rapidly filled up, the European imperialists were 
obliged to focus their attention on a shrinking range of targets. The Americans 
had already emerged from the colonial experience. Most of Asia had been 
subdued at an earlier stage. By the 1880s only Africa, Indo-China, China, and 
the Pacific Islands remained. 

Important distinctions must be made in the various types of colony 
established. Britain held the largest of empires with a minimum of military force. 
It continued to rely heavily on native princes and on local troops. There were 
fewer British bureaucrats in Delhi, ruling an Indian population of 400 millions, 
than Austrian bureaucrats in Prague. All the larger territories settled by British 
immigrants were given self-governing dominion status-Canada in 1867, 
Australia in 1901, New Zealand and Newfoundland in 1907, South Africa in 
1910. France, in contrast, followed a policy of closer integration. The Algerian 
and Tunisian departements were joined to France's metropolitan administration. 
French migration to North Africa, especially of Alsace-Lorrainers displaced by 
the Franco-Prussian War, was officially encouraged. This centralizing tradition 
was closer to Russia's than to Britain's. It caused immense problems when the 



time came for the links to be severed. 


WIENER WELT 

Between 1848 and 1914 Vienna's population multiplied five times over, to 
c.2 million. Vienna's Jewish population increased thirty-five times, from 
5,000 to 175,000, rising from c.l per cent (1848) to c.9 per cent (1914). 

Jews came to Vienna to escape from traditional Jewish life in the East, 
particularly from Bohemia and Galicia, and to receive a modern, secular 
education. For these reasons the number of Jews in Vienna's high schools, 
universities, and professions, was extremely high. In the peak years of 1881- 
6 they formed 33 per cent of the student body. In 1914 they accounted for 26 
per cent of law students and 41 per cent of medical students. They reached 
43 per cent (1910) in the teaching faculty. By 1936 62 per cent of Viennese 
lawyers were of Jewish origin, and 47 per cent of doctors. 1 

Numbers, however, were only part of the story. Thanks to their special 
circumstances, as rising professionals, Vienna's Jews formed a bulwark of 
the bourgeoisie. They were prominent patrons and activists in educational, 
cultural, and artistic charities. As a predominantly immigrant minority, 
anxious to establish their equality, they provided the backbone of liberal 
politics and of the socialist movement. As people who, in different degrees, 
had rejected their own culture, they were specially disposed to everything 
modern and innovative in the cultural world. Their experiences were a 
preview of a later wave of Jewish migration to America. The Jews of Vienna 
were only one of the major forces in the European avant-garde around 1900. 
But it was its Jews who made Vienna what it was in the realm of modern 
culture.' 2 

A selection of names might indicate the depth and variety of Jewish 
talent:

musicologist; S. Sulzer, liturgist; Ed Hanslick, critic; J. Joachim, violinist.

journalists; K. Kraus, critic. Politics: N. Birnbaum, Jewish autonomist; T. 
Herzl, Zionist; Eugenie Schwartzbach, educational reformer; Josephine von 
Wertheimstein, liberal hostess. 

The relationship of Vienna's Jews to Judaism was not simple. A strong 
religious group supported the city's synagogues under their forthright Chief 
Rabbi, Moritz Giidemann (1835-1918). There were also Sephardi and 
Hasidic congregations. Yet many people seen as Jews would have thought of 
themselves more as 'ex-Jews'. Mahler was one of a large contingent who 
had converted to Catholicism. Freud was one of those who rejected all 
religion. 'I gladly and proudly acknowledge my Jewishness.' he wrote, 
'though my attitude to any religion is critically negative.' 3 

One must also remember that the Jews did not form either the sole or the 
largest of Vienna's immigrant groups. Vienna received more Slavs and 
Hungarians than Jews, many of them on the lowest rung of the social scale. 
Considering Austrian anti-semitism at the turn of the century, one cannot 
overlook the generalized xenophobia of which it was part. As shown by 
Vienna's best known anti-semite, Adolf Hitler, the hatred of Jews was 
accompanied by, and often confused with, contempt for Slavs. The paranoia 
about 'Jewish Bolshevism' had deep Viennese roots. 

Nor should one forget the Jews' own prejudices. Westernized Jews were 
tempted to look down on Jews from the East: 'The Frankfurt Jew despises 
the Berlin Jew; the Berlin Jews despise the Viennese Jew; and the Viennese 
Jew the Warsaw Jews.' All tended to look down on the Jews from Galicia, 
'the lowest of all'. 4 

Even the Chief Rabbi could express dubious sentiments. Responding to a 
Catholic lady who asked him to read her pamphlet on anti-semitism, he 
replied in psychoanalytic vein, saying, among other things, that 'Christianity 



finds itself in the unsatisfactory role of a hermaphrodite': 

The Christian kneels before the image of a Jew, wrings his hands before 
the image of a Jewess: his Apostles, Festivals and Psalms are Jewish. Most 
free themselves from [this contradiction] by Anti-semitism. Obliged to 
revere a Jew as God, they wreak vengeance on the rest of the Jews by 
treating them as devils... 

You may say, dear Madam, that the Aryan people have emancipated the 
Jews. This is not the case. The Aryan people have emancipated themselves 
from the Middle Ages. This is one of the quiet and gradual influences which 
the Jewish Bible has exerted on mankind. 5 

The Chief Rabbi urged: 'Judaism bids me love and respect everyone.' 

The bitter-sweet climate of Vienna mixed gall with gaiety. The Emperor 
had to hold the balance. When an openly anti-Jewish politician, Karl Lueger, 
was elected Lord Mayor in 1897, Francis-Joseph refused to confirm. 
Relenting after two days' reflection he accepted Lueger's appointment, 
whilst awarding a medal to Chief Rabbi Giidemann. 


Africa, 'the Dark Continent', retained many of its geographical secrets until 
a surprisingly late date. European colonies had been planted on the northern 
coast from ancient times. But the source of the Nile, which watered the land of 
the Pharaohs, was not properly identified until 1888. Missionary explorers such 
as David Livingstone could still be lost in the 1870s for years on end. Contrary 
to European belief, Africa was devoid neither of organized government nor of 
ordered religion; and a huge variety of languages and cultures belied the idea 
that all Africans were Stone Age savages. However, the 'scramble for Africa' 
took place on the assumption that the land and the peoples were there for the 
taking. Such was the discrepancy in military technology that even the venerable 
kingdoms of West Africa could offer no more resistance than the Aztecs and 
Incas. Abyssinia was the only native empire to maintain its independence, 
perhaps because it adhered to Coptic Christianity. 

China, which possessed the most ancient civilization in the world, also 
possessed an Emperor whom the European governments recognized. Formal 
colonization of the African type was not permitted; so leases of territory, and of 
trading concessions, became the order of the day. Such indeed was the value of 




the Chinese Imperial Government to Europeans that in 1901 it became the object 
of a joint European protectorate. This humiliating episode provided the impetus 
which led ten years later to the creation of the National Republic of China and 
the beginnings of modern Chinese history, [boxer] 

China's neighbour, Japan, was totally closed to outside influence until 1855; 
but so learned the essence of European ways that within a short time it was able 
to establish a colonial empire of its own, first in Korea and then in Chinese 
Manchuria. Japan's comprehensive defeat of Russia in the war of 1904-5, both 
on land and at sea, provided one of the sensations of the age, undermining many 
of Europe's most cherished delusions. 

The Pacific Islands remained immaculate the longest. The final steps in the 
imperialist story saw Germany take Western Samoa (1898) and the USA take 
Hawaii (1900), whilst an Anglo-French condominium was established in the 
New Hebrides (1906). 

If European imperialism, through 'europeanization', furnished one of the 
most powerful formative experiences of the modern world at large, it also 
subjected Europe itself to a wide range of stresses and influences. It divided 
Europe's nations into those which had been proved imperiurngiiltig or 'empire¬ 
worthy' and those which had not, adding an extra tier onto the older category of 
'historic' and 'unhistoric' nations. It gave a marked boost to the economies, and 
hence to the military potential, of those countries which had acquired empires, 
tipping the strategic balance in the favour of Western Europe. It greatly increased 
Europe's familiarity both with non-European cultures and with exotic 'colonial' 
products. In some cases, such as Britain, it made people more familiar with Tibet 
or Bechuanaland than with their European neighbours. Yet it also strengthened 
Europe's religious and racial prejudices, creating barriers and complexes that 
lasted as long as the empires themselves. Those prejudices were sufficiently 
extreme, for example, that in 1904 the city of Hamburg could exhibit a bevy of 
Samoan women in an enclosure of the local zoo.- 


BOXER 

ABOUT 2 p.m. on the afternoon of 14 August 1900, a multinational relief 
force fought its way into Peking after a ten-day march from Tientsin. It 





raised the siege of Peking's stockaded foreign quarter, which had been cut 
off from the outside world for the previous eight weeks. 

China in the twilight of the Dowager Empress was gripped by the Boxer 
Rebellion-a xenophobic movement which was bent on expelling all 
'foreign devils' and all their works. The Boxers, whose English name 
derived from their Chinese emblem-'the fist of righteous harmony'-were 
enraged by everything European, from railways to Christianity. They 
believed that the foreign legations exercised a nefarious influence over their 
own government. In their attempts to expel them they had not hesitated to 
murder European missionaries and diplomats, to massacre Chinese 
Christians, and to burn down much of the old city. They were aided by the 
collusion of at least part of imperial officialdom, and were joined by regular 
Chinese troops. 

In European history, the China expedition of 1900 was unique in that it 
briefly united all the powers in a common enterprise. British, French, 
Germans, Italians, Russians, Americans, and Japanese joined forces to 
suppress the common threat. The defence of the foreign quarter was 
undertaken by a body of marines of various nationalities under the British 
Minister, Sir Claude Macdonald. The relief column, 20,000 strong, was led 
by General Sir Alfred Gaselee, and consisted of Russians, Americans, 
Japanese, and a brigade of the Indian army. A permanent expeditionary force 
of 20,000 German troops under Field Marshal Count von Waldsee arrived at 
the end of September, only to be promptly withdrawn. 

For the solidarity of the Europeans broke down as soon as the immediate 
emergency was saved. Germany and Italy insisted on reparation claims far in 
excess of their partners. Russia refused to participate in moves to prosecute 
Chinese responsible for the massacres. Indeed, the Russian troops who had 
taken control of Manchuria had perpetrated large-scale massacres of their 
own. Britain and Germany interpreted the concluding convention in widely 
differing ways. Not for the first or the last time, all the participants 
demonstrated that European unity, if it existed at all, was best described as a 
flash in the pan. 1 


As predicted by the pessimists, colonial conflicts began to occur at the turn 
of the century. In 1898 Britain and France almost came to blows after their 




expeditionary forces came face to face at Fashoda in Sudan. In 1899-1902 
Britain's war against the two Boer Republics in South Africa was complicated 
by Germany's support for the Boers. In 1906 and again in 1911, French moves to 
gain control of Morocco fired active German protests. But on no occasion did 
colonial rivalry result in all-out war. It certainly added to the sum total of 
resentments; but it could usually be defused by the sort of 'open-door policy' for 
commercial interests as adopted both in China and in Morocco. 

Naval power was the key to imperial success. Battleships were related to the 
control of world-wide commercial interests in a way that land armies could 
never be. (The classic study, The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660- 
1783 (1890), was written by a US admiral, Alfred Thayer Mahan.) The issue was 
brought very much to the fore in 1898. In that year, during the Spanish- 
American War, the US Navy stripped Spain of a string of its remaining colonies 
from Cuba to the Philippines. At the same time the German War Minister, von 
Tirpitz, took the strategic decision to launch a programme of shipbuilding and to 
challenge Britain's fleet of super-battleships. The arms race was on. 

Late Imperial Russia was a magnificent beast. Its obvious defects were offset 
by a seemingly inexhaustible store of power and energy. It had been identified 
long since, by Alexis de Tocqueville and others, as the only power capable in the 
future of challenging the USA. It possessed the largest consolidated state 
territory on the globe, the largest population in Europe, and the world's largest 
army. It was Europe's chief source of agricultural exports and, with untold 
mineral resources, the chief recipient of external investment. Culturally, Russia 
had recently shot forward as one of the most glamorous stars of the European 
firmament. The Russian language, whose earlier literary traditions were limited, 
had grown to sudden maturity. Pushkin, Lermontov, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and 
Chekhov could be counted among the giants of world literature. In the hands of 
Mussorgsky, Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Russian music was unsurpassed. 
The Ballet Russe and the Stanislavsky Theatre School were leaders in their field. 
Socially, Russia still rested on a backward peasant society of ex-serfs. But the lot 
of the peasants was improving; and nowhere did the Peasant Question receive 
more serious attention. The agrarian reforms of P. A. Stolypin in 1906-11 gave 
the peasants mobility and the means to buy land. In European eyes, much of 
Russia's backwardness was masked by the glittering court of the Tsar and by the 
stream of Russian aristocrats, merchants, artists, and professors who were 
thoroughly integrated into every aspect of European life. Politically, Russia was 
thought to be making serious liberal progress after 1905; the problem of the 



nationalities was largely submerged. Stability was required above all; internal 
crises had been repeatedly provoked by the side effects of external wars. What 
Russia needed to realize its enormous potential was an indefinite prolongation of 
the European peace, [Chernobyl] 

Late imperial Germany was the country which felt the most cheated by the 
imperial experience. In many ways it was the model nineteenth-century state- 
modern, scientific, national, prosperous, and strong. But it has been likened to a 
magnificent machine with one loose cog-a machine that began to judder, to 
overheat, and, in its terminal explosions, to wreck the whole factory. Under 
Wilhelm II (r. 1888-1918), whose withered arm was seen as a mark of his 
country's flaws, it assumed an arrogant and a truculent air. Germany's mighty 
industrialization had occurred later than that of Britain and France. Political 
unification had only come about in 1871. As a result, the German colonial 
empire had not assumed the proportions which Germany's pride and prowess 
seemed to deserve. German ideas of Lebensraum, or 'living space', were first 
voiced in connection with her modest colonial swag. Objectively, Germany's 
disadvantage was more imagined than real: her economic penetration of adjacent 
areas in Eastern Europe more than offset the lack of distant colonies. Yet her 
psychological resentments ran deep. The Kaiser and his court did not see that 
peace was the key to Germany's eventual domination of Europe's political and 
economic scene. [e=mc 2 ] 

Modernism. Europe's political unease was matched by many of the cultural 
trends of the fin de siecle, which are often subsumed under the omnibus term of 
Modernism. Modernism involved a series of fundamental breaks with tradition 
that went far beyond the usual ebb and flow of intellectual fashion. As one critic 
was to write, 'The aim of five centuries of European effort is openly 
abandoned'.- It affected all the arts, and is often correlated by theorists with 
other fundamental developments of the period, notably with Freudian 
psychology, Einstein's relativity, Frazer's anthropology, even with anarchist 
politics. Whether or not it was a direct reflection of political and social tensions, 
it was certainly accompanied by a deep feeling of malaise, [aricia] [sound] 

The brilliant and unstable German, Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (1844- 
1900), Professor at Basle, articulated many of the era's most shocking thoughts. 
He once described the philosopher as a 'stick of dynamite'; and in Thus Spake 
Zarathustra (1883-4), From the Genealogy of Morality (1887), The Twilight of 


the Gods (1889), and The Will to Power (1901) he proceeded to explode received 
attitudes. He railed against Christianity, and democracy, and the accepted norms 
of morality. 'Morality 5 , he explained, 'is the herd-instinct in the individual.' And 
'religion is a world of pure-fiction'. Modern mankind was despicable. In its 
place, 'I teach you the Superman'. Ruling elites have always prevailed through 
violence. 'The blond beast, hungry for plunder and victory, is not to be 
mistaken.' Most daringly, he announced 'Gott ist tot' (God is dead), adding, 
'there may still be caves in which his shadow will still be shown.' God's death 
was supposed to be a liberating event. 


CHERNOBYL 

Chernobyl, see CZARNOBYL. A small town on the River Pripet in Ukraine, 
20 versts from the confluence of the Dnieper, and 120 from Kiev. Inhabitants 
6,483-Orthodox 2,160; Old Believers 566; Catholics 84; 'Israelites' 3,683. 
The castle of the estate, which is the property of Count Wtadyslaw 
Chodkiewicz, is charmingly set on a hill overlooking three rivers. The town 
lives from the river-trade, from fishing, and from growing onions.' 1 

The Polish Geographical Dictionary, from which the above extract is 
taken, was published in 1880 with a misleading title designed to beat the 
tsarist censorship. It contains an entry on every town and village that had 
ever belonged to the Polish Commonwealth. Chernobyl was a typical town 
of those vast territories which had once been part of Poland, and which were 
later to become part of the Russian empire and of the Soviet Union. Its 
Jewish inhabitants would have called it their shtetl. The Polish landowners, 
the Jewish townsfolk, and the Ruthenian peasantry had lived there side by 
side for centuries. 

Chernobyl first appeared in a charter of 1193, described as a hunting- 
lodge of the Ruthenian Prince Rostislavitch. Some time later it was taken 
into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, where it became a crown village. The 
castle was built for defence against marauding Tartars. In 1566, three years 
before the Grand Duchy's Ukrainian provinces were transferred to the 
Kingdom of Poland, Chernobyl was granted in perpetuity to a captain of the 
royal cavalry, Filon Kmita, who thereafter styled himself 'Kmita 




Czamobylski'. In due course it passed by marriage to the Sapiehas, and in 
1703 to the Chodkiewicz family. It was annexed by the Russian empire after 
the second partition of Poland in 1793. 

Chernobyl had a very rich religious history. The Jewish community, 
which formed an absolute majority, would probably have been imported by 
Filon Kmita as agents and arendators (leaseholding managers) during the 
Polish campaign of colonization. Later on, they would have included Hasidic 
as well as Orthodox Jews. The Ruthenian peasantry of the district would 
have largely turned to the Greek Catholic (Uniate) religion after 1596, only 
to be forcibly converted to Russian Orthodoxy by the Tsars. The Dominican 
church and monastery was founded in 1626 by Lukasz Sapieha, at the height 
of the Counter-Reformation. In those days Chernobyl was clearly a haven of 
toleration. There was a group of Old Catholics, who opposed the decrees of 
the Council of Trent, just as the seventeenth century saw the arrival of a 
group of raskolniki or Old Believers from Russia. They all escaped the worst 
horrors of Khmyel'nytsky's rising of 1648-54, and that of 1768-9, when one 
of the rebel leaders, Bondarenko, was caught and brutally executed by 
Chodkiewicz's hussars. The Dominican monastery was sequestrated by the 
Tsarist authorities in 1832, the church of the Raskolniki in 1852. 

Since 1880, Chernobyl has seen many changes of fortune. In 1915 it was 
occupied by the Germans, and in the ensuing civil war was fought over by 
Bolsheviks, Whites, and Ukrainians. In the Polish-Soviet War of 1919-20 it 
was taken first by the Polish Army and then by the Red Cavalry. From 1921 
it was incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR, and experienced the mass 
killings of Stalin's collectivization campaign and Terror-Famine. The Polish 
population was deported during the frontier clearances of 1936. The Jewish 
community was killed by the Nazis during the German occupation of 1941- 
4. Twenty years later, it was chosen as the site of one of the first Soviet 
nuclear power stations. From 1991, it was joined to the Republic of Ukraine, 

[HARVEST] [KONARMIA] 

The Great Soviet Encyclopedia mentions none of these facts. A six-line 
entry talks only of a regional city of the Ukrainian SSR, which possesses an 
iron foundry, a cheese plant, a ship-repair yard, an artistic workshop, and a 
medical school. 2 



As it happens, the name of Chernobyl/Czarnobyl is taken from one of the 
Slavonic words for the wormwood plant (artemisia), which flourishes in the 
surrounding marshes. In the Bible, wormwood is used as a synonym for 
bitterness and hence for the wrath of God: 

And there fell a great star from Heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell 
upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters. And the 
name of the star is called Wormwood... . And many men died of the waters 
because they were made bitter. 3 

For anyone who takes their New Testament literally, the explosion at 
Chernobyl on 26 April 1986 was surely caused by the wrath of God. 


Nietzsche seemed to be preaching that life had no meaning beyond the 
mastery of the strong. He was seen by his enemies as the prophet of wickedness, 
and of cultivated irrationality. He was to philosophy what Kierkegaard had been 
to theology. Both were pioneers of existentialism. 'Christianity resolved to find 
that the world was bad and ugly,' declared Nietzsche, 'and has made it bad and 
ugly.'- [FOLLY] 


e = me 2 

On 28 January 1896 Germany's Interior Ministry approved an unusual 
application for renouncing state citizenship. The applicant, resident in 
Switzerland, was only 16 years old. He had failed the entrance exam to the 
Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule in Zurich, and was studying at the 
cantonal school in Aarau. Born at Ulm and raised in Munich, the refugee 
student hated the regimentation of German schooling. He disliked his 
Catholic primary school, and fled his Gymnasium early. He felt very 
insecure after his family moved to Milan. Like many young ex-Jews, he was 
anti-religious, pacifist, and attracted by radical socialism. His one talent was 
with mathematics. 

Finally admitted to the ETH, Albert Einstein (1879-1955) cut the 








lectures but conducted electrodynamic experiments of his own in the 
laboratories. He was friendly with Friedrich Adler, who later assassinated the 
Austrian Prime Minister in Vienna. When employed at the Swiss patent 
office in Berne in 1901-5, he continued to puzzle over the theoretical 
implications of work by Maxwell, Hertz, and Mach. 

It is said that Einstein's hunch about the relativity of time and space was 
stimulated by daily tram-rides up the Kramgasse in Berne, where he 
imagined that he was travelling towards the clock-tower at the speed of light. 
Presuming that the light waves reflecting his image were moving at the same 
speed, he wondered for years whether or not he could have seen himself in 
the driver's mirror. At all events, in the principle of 'the relativity of 
simultaneity', he came to realize that Nature knows no instantaneous 
interactions. Whilst the speed of light is absolute, c. 186,300 miles per 
second, intervals of time and space are relative. In 1905, in the Annalen der 
Physik, he published an article entitled 'Does the Inertia of a Body Depend 
Upon Its Energy Content?'. It contained the equation which would overturn 
classical physics and would lay the foundations for the nuclear age. Where e 
= energy, m = mass, and c = the speed of light, e = me 2 . 

In due course, in addition to this Special Theory of Relativity, Einstein 
produced the General Theory of Relativity (1916), replacing Newton's Laws 
of Gravitation. It made a major contribution to quantum physics. He moved 
to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin in 1914, receiving a Nobel Prize in 
1921. 

In the days before his theories were shown to be correct, Einstein 
worried constantly. 'If Relativity proves right,' he once said, 'the Germans 
will call me a German, the Swiss will call me a Swiss, and the French will 
call me a great scientist. If Relativity is proved wrong, the French will call 
me a Swiss, the Swiss will call me a German, and the Germans will call me a 
Jew.' 1 

In 1933, when Einstein sought refuge in Paris from the Nazis, the 
College de France refused him employment because of his German 
citizenship, thereby obliging him to leave for the USA. Europe's most 
brilliant mind was lost to Europe. 



SOUND 


Late in 1888, or early in 1889, at his London home, the ageing poet Robert 
, Browning was invited to recite some of his poetry for the benefit of 
Edison's 'perfected phonograph'. He started on his most popular verse: 

I sprang to the stirrup, and Joris, and he; 

I galloped, Dirck galloped, we galloped all three. 

'God Speed!' cried the watch, as the gatebolts undrew; 

'Speed!' echoed the wall to us galloping through. 

Behind shut the postern, the lights sank to rest, 

And into the midnight we galloped abreast. 

Not a word to each other, we kept the great pace 

Neck by neck, stride by stride, never changing our pace; 

I turned in my saddle, and ... and ... 1 

After a few lines he faltered, and confessed that he had forgotten the words 
written more than forty years before. Recovering, he said to applause that he 
would never forget the day when he had talked for Mr Edison's famous 
machine. This impromptu and undated performance gave rise to one of the 
very earliest sound recordings to have survived. 2 

In that same year the German, Emile Berliner, demonstrated his 
Gramophone, which in place of wax cylinders used discs that could be more 
readily copied. Manufactured by the toy firm Kammerer und Reinhardt of 
Waltershausen in Thuringia, the gramophone quickly became the basis of 
sound recordings for the mass market-a central fea-ture.of modern life. 3 

Recorded sound has transformed the world of music and of musical 
appreciation. For Mozart's bicentenary in 1991, for instance, it was possible 
to mount an exhibition demonstrating the evolution of the quality and variety 
of performed sound over the last 200 years. Visitors to Vienna's Neue Burg 
were equipped with stereo headphones that responded to infra-red signals as 
they moved from one 'sound zone' to another. They could listen to Leopold 
Mozart's own violin playing excerpts from his famous Primer published in 
the year of Wolfgang's birth, or compare the sounds of valveless horns and 
trumpets to those of modern brass instruments. They could listen to the 
extraordinary slow tempo of an early operatic recording from 1900, with 



Wilhelm Hersch singing the aria £ 0 Isis und Osiris', or watch as a 
computerized sonograph screen analysed the harmonic range of Edita 
Gruberova singing 'The Queen of the Night'. One could not hear Mozart 
himself, alas. But the least expert of listeners could tell how tremendously 
the performance of Mozartian scores has evolved over time. Here was 
Mozart's changing 'sound world' brought to life. 4 

Sound recording has revolutionized people's perception of their past in many 
ways. Before 1888, the historical record lacked one of its most vital 
dimensions: it was silent. Documents and artefacts are deaf and dumb. There 
is no trace of the roar of Napoleon's battles, the tempo of Beethoven's 
concerts, the tone of Cavour's speeches. After 1888, history received its 
soundtrack and has been immeasurably enriched. 

The National Sound Archive of the British Library, which possesses 
Browning's flustered recital, is typical of scores of similar collections that 
now exist in every European country. The first such 'phonotheque' opened in 
Paris in 1910. Members of the International Association of Sound Archives 
(IASA) range from the vast collections of national broadcasting corporations 
to tiny local or private concerns. Apart from music, the main divisions relate 
to folklore, literature, radio, oral history, and dialectology. 5 

In Eastern Europe, Count Tolstoy was among the pioneers recorded for 
posterity. In 1910, the March issue of Talking Machine News commented: 
'An order has been issued prohibiting the sale of Tolstoy's record in the 
Czar's territory. When will the Slavs rise up and do away with such narrow¬ 
mindedness?' 6 


No less influential than Nietzsche was the bowdlerized version of his 
philosophy peddled by his sister. Elizabeth Nietzsche-Foerster (1846-1935), 
who led a party of 'Aryan' settlers to the colony of Nueva Germania in Paraguay 
in 1886, nursed her dying brother and appropriated his ideas. She befriended 
both Wagner and Mussolini, idolized the Nazis, and linked the name of 
Nietzsche with racism and antisemitism. A tearful Fiihrer would attend her 
funeral. 

From the sociological point of view, Nietzsche's views may be seen as an 
intellectual's revulsion against the rise of mass literacy, and of mass culture in 





general. They were espoused by an international coterie of artists and writers, 
which wished to strengthen the barriers between so-called 'high culture' and 
'low culture', and hence to preserve the role of the self-appointed aristocracy of 
ideas. In this, they formed a suitable partner for modernism in the arts, one of 
whose chief attractions lay in the fact that it was unintelligible to the person in 
the street. 'Mass culture generated Nietzsche in opposition to itself,' writes a 
recent critic, 'as its antagonist. The immense popularity of his ideas among early 
twentieth-century intellectuals suggests the panic that the threat of the masses 
aroused.'- 

In retrospect, it is the virulence with which Nietzsche and his admirers 
poured contempt on 'the masses' that appears most shocking. 'Many, too many, 
are born,' spake Nietzsche's Zarathustra, 'and they hang on their branches much 
too long.' In The Will to Power, Nietzsche called for 'a declaration of war by 
higher men on the masses ... The great majority of men have no right to 
existence.' In a private letter written in 1908, D. H. Lawrence, who had just 
discovered Nietzsche in Croydon Public Library, actually imagined a gas 
chamber for the painless disposal of superfluous people: 


FOLLY 

Nietzsche once complained that historians never write about the things 
which make history really interesting-anger, passion, ignorance, and folly. 
He can only have been referring to the German School. In Poland, for 
example, there has been a long tradition of analysing the past in terms of 
vices and virtues. Bochenski's classic work, The History of Stupidity in 
Poland, was published in 1842. 1 In 1985 the dissident historian Adam 
Michnik wrote his account of Polish resistance to Communism in terms of 
The History of Honour. 2 

Nowadays everyone has learned that the study of 'Mentalities' is central 
to the historian's trade. An American historian has demonstrated that Folly 
has marched through European history from beginning to end. The Trojans 
admitted the Wooden Horse; the Renaissance popes provoked the Protestant 
secession; the British government drove the American colonists to rebel... 3 
Yet everyone can learn from mistakes. The old Polish proverb says Polak 





mqdry po szkodzie (a Pole is wise when the damage is done). Blake said 
something similar in his Proverbs of Hell: 'If every fool would persist in his 
folly he would become wise.' Real folly consists of making the same mistake 
twice. One could write European history in those terms as well, [annales] 


If I had my way, I would build a lethal chamber as big as the Crystal Palace with a military band playing 
softly, and a cinematograph working brightly; then I'd go out in the back streets and main streets and bring 
them in, all the sick, the halt, the maimed; I would lead them gently, and they would smile a weary thanks; 
and the band would softly bubble out the Hallelujah Chorus.- 

This gem, thirty-three years before Auschwitz, came out of Edwardian England. 
So, too, did the deeper thoughts of H. G. Wells (1866-1946), seer, socialist, 
author of The Time Machine (1895) and The War of the Worlds (1898), and one 
of the most popular and prolific writers of the age. In his Anticipations (1902), 
he showed himself an enthusiastic advocate of eugenics, the science of improved 
human breeding which demanded the elimination of the weak, the inferior, and 
the undesirable. 'And how will the New Republic treat the inferior races', he 
asked, 'the black... the yellow men ... the alleged termite of the civilised world, 
the lew?'- 

The important point to remember, of course, is that 'the masses', as reviled 
by their detractors, did not and do not exist. 'Crowds can be seen; but the mass 
-the sum of all possible crowds, [is] the crowd in its metaphysical aspect ... a 
metaphor ... [which] turns other people into a conglomerate ... [and] denies 
them the individuality which we ascribe to ourselves and to people we know.'- 

In this same era, the challenge of Marxism spawned intellectual debates 
which far transgressed the narrow bounds of politics. For example, early 
readings in historical materialism provided the spur for the 'Philosophy of Spirit' 
developed by the Neapolitan writer Benedetto Croce (1866-1952). Croce's work 
in Aesthetics (1902), in Logic (1905), and in The Theory of Historiography 
(1917) was accompanied by historical studies of Naples, of modern Europe, and 
of contemporary Italy. Rejecting both metaphysics and religion, he stressed the 
role of human intuition and the importance of history as the study of evolving 
spirit. His journal Critica, founded in 1903, gave a platform for his ideas for half 
a century. Later in life, Croce was to become the intellectual leader of opposition 
to Italian fascism. 

Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), an Austrian physician, was founder of the 





theory and practice of psychoanalysis. His work exercised a profound influence 
not only on the nascent medical sciences of psychology and psychiatry, but on 
all branches of the humanities concerned with the workings of mind and 
personality. Starting from hypnosis, he explored the unconscious processes 
whereby the human mind defends itself against external and internal pressures. 
In particular, he revealed the role of sexuality in the life of the unconscious and 
of repression in the formation of neuroses. The publication of The Interpretation 
of Dreams (1900) brought in many followers who were soon to form the 
International Psychoanalytical Association. Dissension ensued, however, 
especially when one of Freud's early associates, Carl Jung (1875-1961), 
launched the concept ofcollective psychoanalysis' in The Psychology of the 
Unconscious (1912), together with the distinction between introvert and 
extrovert personalities. In Civilisation and its Discontents (1930) Freud argued 
that the repression of desire required by life in developed societies made 
happiness virtually impossible. He was driven by the rise of the Nazis to flee to 
England in 1938. By that time psychoanalysis had many strands and many 
critics; but it had established a new, uneasy dimension in people's perception of 
themselves: 'The Ego is not the master in its own house.'- 

Decadence, as an artistic movement, can be regarded as an outgrowth of late 
Romanticism. It was born of the desire to explore the most extreme experiences 
of human sensuality. In the process, despite endless scandals, it furnished some 
of the most creative masterpieces of European culture. Its links with Romantic 
precursors can be traced through Charles Baudelaire (1821-67), who had 
translated both De Quincey and Poe into French. Baudelaire's collection Les 
Fleurs du Mai (1857) was later seen as the manifesto of poetical symbolism, a 
style seeking to find hidden 'correspondences' of order and beauty beneath the 
ugly surface of reality: 

La Nature est un temple ou de vivants piliers 

Laissent parfois sortir de confuses paroles; 

L'homme y passe a travers des forets de symboles 

Qui le regardent avec des regards familiers. 

(Nature is a temple where living columns I now and then release confused words; I There Man passes 
amongst forests of symbols I which watch him with familiar glances.)- 


In his 'Invitation to the Voyage', he sets out for an imaginary paradise, 'where 


everything is order and beauty, delectation, calm and bliss'- La, tout n'est 
aurorare et beaute, I Luxe, calme et volupte. Baudelaire's successors, especially 
Paul Verlaine (1844-96) and Arthur Rimbaud (1854-91) achieved poetical 
effects which were the linguistic counterparts of the images of the Impressionist 
painters, whom they were among the first to admire: 

Les sanglots longs 
Des violons 
De l'automne 
Blessent mon coeur 
D'une langueur 
Monotone. 

(The long sobbings I Of the violins I Of autumn I Wound my heart I With their 
languorous I Monotony.)- 

A noir, E blanc, I rouge, U vert, O bleu: voyelles 
(Black A, white E, red I, Green U, blue O-vowels)- 

The Decadents paid dearly for their defiance. Verlaine expressed the view 
that 'decadence implies ... the most sophisticated thoughts of extreme 
civilization'. But few of his contemporaries agreed. Baudelaire was heavily fined 
and humiliated for the 'offence to public morals' supposedly contained in his 
poems. Verlaine was imprisoned, having eloped with Rimbaud and shot him 
during a quarrel. In 1893 a German writer in Paris decried the drugs, the 
homosexuality, the pornography, the hysteria, and 'the end of an established 
order that has satisfied logic and fettered depravity for thousands of years'. 'The 
prevalent feeling', wrote Max Nordau, 'is that of imminent perdition and 
extinction.'- In England, Oscar Fingall O'Flahertie Wills Wilde (1854-1900), 
author of several brilliant comic dramas, notably The Importance of Being 
Earnest (1895), spent two bitter years in Reading Gaol for homosexual offences. 
Much of the work of his collaborator, the erotic illustrator Aubrey Beardsley 
(1872-98), was unpunishable, as was that of Algernon Swinburne (1837-1909), 
poet, critic, and Old Etonian flagellant. The mood of these aesthetes was totally 
at odds with the preoccupations of most sections of society, where religious 
observance, social betterment, and temperance were at their height, [bambini] 

[TOUR] 

Modern painting broke forever with the representational art which had 
prevailed since the Renaissance, and which photography had now rendered 


obsolete. The moment of departure came in 1863, when edouard Manet (1832- 
83) in a fit of exhibitionism exhibited Le Dejeuner sur Lherbe at the 'Salon des 
Refuses' in Paris. From then on a dazzling succession of labels had to be 
invented to keep track of the trends and groupings which were incessantly 
experimenting with genre, technique, colour, and form. The original 
Impressionists, Monet, Pissarro, Sisley, Renoir, Cezanne, and Degas, so named 
after Monet's Impression, Sunrise (1874), were followed by the Pointillists 
(1884) led by Seurat, the Neo-impressionists (1885), the Nabis (1888) of 
Serusier and Bonnard, the Synthetists (1888) inspired by Gauguin, and the 
Expressionists (1905) pioneered by Ensor, Van Gogh, and the German Briicke 
Group. After them came the Orphists, the Fauves (1905), headed by Matisse, 
Dufy, and Vlaminck, the Cubists (1908) of Braque and Picasso, the Futurists, the 
Black Cat and the Blue Rider Group (1912). By 1910 or 1911, in the work of 
Vassily Kandinsky (1866-1944), a Russian settled in Germany, painting 
approached the stage of pure abstractionism, [impression] 


BAMBINI 

On 6 January 1907 a one-room nursery school opened its doors in Rome's 
slum suburb of San Lorenzo. It was equipped with child-size furniture, with 
a cupboard full of puzzles and learning games, and with no qualified teacher. 
It was provided for the children of working parents who would otherwise 
abandon them on the streets during the daytime. It was called La Casa dei 
Bambini, 'the Children's House'. 

The founder of the school, Dr Maria Montessori (1870-1952), was a 
woman well in advance of her time. She was a feminist who advocated equal 
pay for equal work, a qualified doctor, and director of an institute for 
retarded infants. Secretly, she was also the mother of an illegitimate boy, 
Mario Montessori, who was later to run the Association Montessori 
Internationale in Amsterdam. 

The Montessori Method, published in 1910, preached the principles of 
child-centred education. Children want to learn. Children can teach 
themselves. Children have five serses and must explore them all. Children 
must have the freedom to choose what to learn and when. All they need is a 




place free from intimidation, proper equipment, and encouragement. These 
ideas were anathema to most of the educators of the day, who favoured 
'chalk and talk', religious instruction, ferocious discipline, and a rigid 
syllabus and timetable. 'Education is not acquired by listening to words,' Dr 
Montessori told them, 'but by experiences in the environment.' 1 

Some of Montessori's ideas can still raise a frown. She believed that 
children hate sweets, and love silence. She insisted that writing should 
precede reading. But her central conviction, that the needs of the child are 
paramount, became the cornerstone of modern, progressive pedagogics. 
Hundreds of her schools were opened across Europe, and in the USA. In 
Fascist Italy and in Nazi Germany they were closed down. 

In many ways, Montessori followed in the steps of two earlier pioneers- 
the Swiss J. H. Pestalozzi (1746-1827) and the Thuringian Friedrich Froebel 
(1782-1852). Froebel's first Kindergarten or 'Children's Garden', set up at 
Burgdorf near Berne in 1837, was the true ancestor of the Casa dei Bambini. 
Montessori's ideas on child psychology were in turn developed by the Swiss 
educationalist, Jean Piaget (1896-1980). 2 


TOUR 

At 2.15 pm on 1 July 1903, some sixty cyclists set off from a starting-line 
near the cafe of Reveil-Matin in the Parisian suburb of Montgeron. They 
were heading for Lyons, over 467 km of ill-made roads, on the first of six 
designated stages of the first Tour de France. They were expected to ride 
night and day. Nineteen days later, Maurice Garin was acclaimed the winner 
when he entered the Pare des Princes, having covered a total of 2,430 km at 
an average road speed of 26.5 km per hour. He was riding a machine with 
dropped handlebars, and wore knee-length stockings, plus-fours, a polo-neck 
sweater, and a flat cap with earflaps. His prize was 6,125 Fr.F.-the 
equivalent of £242. With the exception of the war years, the race has been 
contested every July ever since. 1 

Europe's most protracted and most popular sporting event arose from the 




conjunction of several modern phenomena-the concept of leisure and 
recreation; the organization of mass (male) sport; targeted technology-in 
this case cable brakes, cycle gears, and rubber tyres; and the competition of 
mass-circulation newspapers. 

The immediate origins lay in the rivalry of two Parisian weeklies, L 'Auto 
('The Motor Car') and Le Velo ('The Bicycle'). The publisher of L'Auto, 
Henri Desgrange, who was trying to break into the cycling market, had been 
successfully sued for changing his paper's name io L'Auto-Velo. The Tour 
was his response. He never looked back. He saw the circulation of LAuto 
multiply dramatically whilst Le Velo dwindled into obscurity. He remained 
patron and sponsor of the Tour until his retirement in 1936. 

The Tour took final form over a period of years. The route, in particular, 
varied. For five years, from 1906, it was extended to include Alsace; but 
permission was withdrawn by the German government when roadside 
crowds began singing the Marseillaise. In the mountains, it was directed 
over the Col de Tourmalet (2,122 m) in the Pyrenees, and the terrifying Col 
du Galibier (3,242 m) in Savoy, where contestants had to carry their 
machines over unmade tracks. From a maximum length over 5,000 km, it 
settled down in the 1930s to a more modest length c.3,700 km, undertaken in 
30 daily stages. The idea of a bright-coloured jersey to identify the race 
leader was adopted in July 1913, when Desgrange dashed into a wayside 
store and bought the first maillot jaune. 

After the First World War, the Tour assumed international proportions. 
Belgian, Italian, and Spanish riders frequently gained the laurels. Champions 
such as Eddie Merckx or Jacques Anquetil had a following as great as any 
sports stars. In July 1991, watched by 22 million spectators, the 79th Tour 
was won by the Basque from Spain, Miguel Indurain, with an average speed 
of 39.504 km/h. 2 In 1994, the 82nd Tour saw Indurain winning for an 
unprecedented fourth time in a row over a course which took the riders 
across the Channel to England. And Indurain would live to ride again. 


In architecture and design, the Continent-wide wave of Art Nouveau 
'seceded' from prevailing standards and practices. The earliest example was 
Victor Horta's Tassel House (1893) in Brussels. But its monuments could be 
found at every point between the Glasgow School of Art (1898) of C. R. 




Mackintosh, the factories of Peter Behrens in Germany, and a string of Austro- 
Hungarian railway stations from Carlsbad to Czernowitz. The Secessionshaus 
(1898) in Vienna was built by J. Olbrich in what was called the Jugendsdl for 
exhibiting the works of breakaway artists. It bears the inscription: 'der zeit ihre 
kunst: I der kunst ihre freiheit' (Art for its time; freedom for Art). 

In music, Debussy and Ravel explored musical impressionism. Then, with 
Schoenberg, Hindemith, and Webern, the avant-garde abandoned the basic 
harmonies and rhythms which had reigned since the Middle Ages, [tone] 

In literature, the Decadents' defiance of social and sexual mores was 
overtaken by intellectual radicalism of a still more profound order. First the 
Frenchman Marcel Proust (1871-1922) and the Irishman James Joyce (1882- 
1941), then Franz Kafka (1883-1924), a German Jew from Prague, overturned 
accepted views concerning the reality of the world, and the means whereby 
human beings perceive it. They were the literary partners of Freud and Einstein, 

[COMBRAY] 

The year 1913 saw the appearance of the first volume of Proust's a la 
recherche du temps perdu and of Kafka's first stories. The premiere of 
Stravinsky's Sacre du Printemps caused a riot in Paris. One publisher in Dublin 
tore up Joyce's manuscripts for fear of libel, whilst others took their courage in 
their hands with D. H. Lawrence's Sons and Lovers and Apollinaire's Alcools. 
The first light of day fell on Max Ernst's Landscape (Town and Animals) and on 
Kokoshka's Self-portrait Most European artistic ventures, like most of 
European society, still clung to tried and traditional forms; but in the world of 
Modernism, the fashion was to tear apart the very foundations of conventional 
culture. 

International relations had remained remarkably stable throughout the 
nineteenth century. Europe continued to be dominated by the five Great Powers 
that had organized the Congress of Vienna; and no general conflict had occurred 
between them since 1815. The wars which did break out were limited both in 
time and scope. There were international police actions, where one of the Powers 
could intervene to suppress revolutionary outbreaks that could not be controlled 
locally. Such were repeated French interventions in Spain and in Italy, or 
Russian interventions in Poland and Hungary. There were regional conflicts, 
notably in Italy, in Germany, and in the Balkans. There were various colonial 
wars overseas. But there was nothing to match the scale of the Napoleonic Wars 



before 1815 or the Great War which began in 1914. Europe's energies were for 
long directed either inwards, to the tasks of internal change, or outwards to fresh 
imperialist conquests across the globe. Only two intractable problems possessed 
the capacity to upset the international order. One of them was the accelerating 
rivalry between France and Germany. The other was the so-called 'Eastern 
Question'. 


IMPRESSION 

In the 1860s, Claude Monet and Auguste Renoir liked to paint together. I 
They wanted to see how each would capture a different effect from the same 
scene, and to compare their results. One of their favourite haunts was the 
suburban riverside of Bougival, beyond St Cloud, near Paris. 

Monet's La Seine a Bougival dates from 1869 (see Plate 67). He appears 
at first to have chosen the mundane, not to say banal, scene of people 
strolling over a bridge in the evening sunlight. Yet he was trying to achieve 
an entirely novel effect: he was not painting the world as he thought it was or 
ought to be, i.e. realistically or idealistically; he was painting the impression 
which the world made on him. Another canvas of his, Impression: Lever du 
soleil (1874), was to lend its name to a movement which was deliberately 
and unashamedly subjective. Monet paid a high price for pursuing his own 
stubborn course. For years he sold no pictures. To his contemporaries his 
work seemed either worthless or outrageous. Once, when he left Paris to 
visit his new-born son, creditors seized the contents of his studio and sold 
them off for a pittance. He attempted suicide. 1 

The Impressionists were interested in three matters. First, they sought to 
explore the foibles of the human eye which contrives to see certain things 
and not to see others. For this reason, they were intent on constructing an 
imprecise or selective image. Monet's deliberately blurred brush strokes at 
Bougival produced blotchy waves, lop-sided windows, fuzzy leaves, and 
messy clouds. 

Secondly, they were fascinated by the wonderful workings of light. 
Monet had served for a couple of years with the Chasseurs d'Afrique, and 
had seen the extreme effects of desert light in the Sahara. He would later 




conduct a series of systematic experiments with light by painting the same 
subjects over and over again. His twelve studies of the facade of Rouen 
Cathedral, each one bathed in the different light of a different time of day, 
did much to convince the public of the method in his madness. 

Thirdly, they were delving into the complex variations in the sensibility 
and receptivity of the artist's own mind. This was the key to the epoch- 
making impetus which they gave to modern art. 

It is sometimes considered that modern art, and Impressionism in 
particular, was reacting against the realistic imagery made possible by 
photography, [photo] In fact, nothing could be more selective and transitory 
than the image registered by light entering a camera lens for a fraction of a 
second at a specific exposure and a specific angle. The Impressionists were 
intensely interested in photography. They often used it in their preparatory 
studies. Cezanne, for instance, used snapshots both for his landscapes and 
his self-portraits. 2 However, the camera, though selective like the human eye 
and very responsive to the play of light, has no mind. And it is in the realm 
of the human mind that modern artists really came into their own. For that 
reason, they ultimately reached their goal, which, in Cezanne's words, was 
to make themselves 'more famous than the old masters'. 


COM BRAY 

Europe is full of locations redolent of time past. But there is none to equal 
the village of llliers, near Chartres. For llliers was the place which provided 
Marcel Proust with his boyhood vacations, and which he was to recreate in 
his mind as 'Combray'. 

Of all the literary masters, Proust was the supreme timesmith-and 
hence a writer of special interest to historians. He was convinced that the 
past never dies, and that it can be recaptured by art from the deepest levels of 
subconscious memory. Hence, a banal incident such as the crumbling of 
cake into a cup of tea could trigger the recall of places and events thought 
lost for ever. More exactly, it could trigger the recall not just of similar 
banalities in the past but of worlds of emotion and experience with which 




they were inextricably connected. 

For this reason, Proust spent the nineteen years from 1903 to 1922 
immured in a fumigated, cork-lined room in Paris, isolated from the world in 
an attempt to bring the past back to life. And much which he resurrected, 
together with the myriad thoughts and anxieties of his youth, was to be 
found at llliers-'la maison de Tante Leonie', 'la rue de l'Oiseau-Fleche', 'le 
Pare de Tansonville', 'le cote de chez Swann': 

These are not at all the sort of places where a great man was born, or where 
he died, and which one visits to pay him homage. These are the places which 
he admired, which he asked to provide him with thought, and which still 
stand guard over that thought ... 1 

Generally speaking, the spirit of the past is best preserved in small intimate 
museums. One can still feel the shade of Charles Dickens in his house on 
Doughty St, London WC1; one can visit the life of the young Karl in the 
Marxhaus, preserved by the SPD in face of much adversity at Trier; and one 
can still imagine oneself stretched out on Freud's red velvet couch in his 
house at Bergstrasse 19 in Vienna. But the ultimate pilgrimage in search of 
lost time can only be directed to that very ordinary village in the Eure-et- 
Loir, now suitably renamed in Proust's honour 'llliers-Combray'. 


Franco-German rivalry could be traced to the division of Charlemagne's 
Empire; but its modern emanations were rooted in the Revolutionary Wars. 
Frenchmen remembered the two German powers, Prussia and Austria, as the 
invaders of 1793 and 1814-15. Prussians and Austrians remembered France as 
the occupier of 1805-13, against whom their modern existence had been won 
and defined. For several decades after 1815 a defeated France and a divided 
Germany were indisposed to brawl. Yet the old animosities seethed under the 
surface. By 1840 France was once again demanding the frontier of the Rhine, 
and raising a storm of German protest reflected in the patriotic songs of the day, 
'Die Wacht am Rhein' and the 'Deutschlandlied'. In 1848 France was seen, once 
again, as the source of Germany's internal unrest. By the 1860s, when France 
was launched into the self-confident adventures of the Second Empire and 
Prussia was asserting itself in Germany, both powers were frightened by the 




other's aggressive posture. Bismarck engineered the perfect pretext through the 
Ems Telegram. As it proved, he engineered the event whose consequences would 
destroy the balance. 

The Franco-German War of 1870-1, the third of Bismarck's lightning wars, 
caused an even bigger sensation than Sadova. It was actively sought by the 
French, who were itching to teach the Prussians a lesson. But they found 
themselves facing a coalition of all the German states, whose forces were better 
armed, better organized, and better led. France's military supremacy, which had 
lasted since Rocroi in 1643, was annulled in less than two months. The first 
cannon-shot was ceremoniously fired on 1 August 1870 by the Emperor 
Napoleon's son, to cries of 'a Berlin'. After that, one mighty German thrust 
surged across the frontier, and encircled the main French army at Metz. Another 
French army, marching to the relief of Metz with the Emperor at its head, 
marched straight into a finely laid trap near Sedan. In the immortal words of 
General Bazaine on the eve of almost certain defeat: 'Nous sommes dans le pot 
de chambre, et demain nous serons emmerdes'- (We are in the chamber pot, and 
tomorrow we shall be covered in it). Surrounded on all sides, and battered at 
arm's length by an enemy that had learned to refrain from frontal assaults, the 
French resisted Krupp's steel guns for some hours before capitulating. The 
Emperor was taken prisoner, abdicated, and eventually took refuge in England. 
France fought on for eight months; but with Paris besieged, starving, and 
crumbling from the Prussian artillery, the government of the Third Republic was 
forced to sue for a humiliating peace. In May 1871 it submitted, consenting to 
cede Alsace-Forraine, to pay huge reparations, and to accept German occupation 
for two years. 

Prussia's crowning victory had several long-term consequences. It facilitated 
the declaration of a united German Empire, whose first Emperor, William I (r. 
1871-88), King of Prussia, was acclaimed by the princes of Germany assembled 
at Versailles. It served notice that the new Germany would be second to none in 
military prowess. In France, it provoked the desperate events of the Paris 
Commune, and it fuelled the passions of anti-German hatred that were to call 
ever more insistently for revenge. 

The 'Eastern Question', as it came to be called, grew from two related and 
apparently unstoppable processes-the continuing expansion of the Russian 
Empire and the steady retreat of the Ottomans. It gave rise to the independence 
of the Balkan nations, to the Crimean War (1854-6), and to a chain of 


complications which eventually sparked the fatal crisis of 1914. The prospect of 
Ottoman collapse loomed ever more starkly throughout the century. For the 
Russians, this was entirely desirable. The re-establishment of Christian power on 
the Bosporus had formed the ultimate goal of tsarist policy ever since the myth 
of the Third Rome was formulated. Possession of the Straits would fulfil 
Russia's dream of unrestricted access to warm water. As Dostoevsky remarked 
in 1871, in triumphant expectation: 'Constantinople will be ours!' For the other 
Powers, the demise of the 'Sick Man of Europe' held a host of dangers. Britain 
feared for its lines of communications to India. Austria felt threatened by the 
emergence of a gaggle of Russian-sponsored states on her south-eastern border. 
Germany felt threatened by the rise of the only land power whose military 
capacity might some day overtake her own. 

Russia's compulsive expansion continued at a rate which for the period 
1683-1914 has been calculated on average, perhaps conservatively, at 55 square 
miles per day.- But it did not always threaten Europe directly. Following the 
gains of the Napoleonic period, the main thrusts were now directed against what 
Russians sometimes called the 'Middle South' in the Caucasus and Central Asia, 
and against China and Japan. Europe, however, was not immune from the Bear 
which constantly probed the limits of tolerance. Russia's involvement in the 
Greek War of Independence sounded the alarm bells, and her gains at the Treaty 
of Adrianople (1829) were restricted to a small corner on the Danube delta. Both 
in 1831 and 1863, Russian violation of Poland's nominal independence evoked 
vigorous protests from Britain and France. But it was not unwelcome to Berlin 
and Vienna, which had Polish territories of their own to hold down. So nothing 
was done. Russia's advance into the Danubian principalities in 1853 provoked an 
immediate military response from Austria and the onset of the Crimean War (see 
below). After that, St Petersburg understood that direct annexations in Europe 
could be costly, and that parts of her empire were vulnerable to attack from 
adversaries with superior naval power. The decision was taken to withdraw from 
North America; and in 1867 Alaska was sold off to the USA for a trifling $8 
million. Real estate was more easily acquired elsewhere. In 1859, after half a 
century of brutality and devastation, the conquest of the mountain tribes of the 
Caucasus was completed, and their Chechen hero, Shamil, captured. In 1860 the 
Amur and Maritime provinces were acquired from China, in 1864 Turkestan 
from Persia, in 1875 Sakhalin and the Kuriles from Japan. All these gains would 
later be denounced by the losers as the fruit of 'unequal treaties'. In 1900 the 
Russian occupation of Manchuria provoked conflict and defeat in the Russo- 


Japanese War (1904-5). In 1907 the division of Persia into British and Russian 
spheres of influence ended several decades of Britain's fears over Central Asia 
whilst raising suspicions about Russia's designs on the Persian Gulf. 

The Crimean War (1853-6) took place when Britain and France decided to 
assist the Porte in efforts to defend the Danube principalities and to resist 
Russian claims of protection over the Ottomans' Christian subjects. Austria 
immediately occupied the principalities, and the Western powers, aided by 
Sardinia, sent a punitive expedition to the Crimea. Despite nasty trench warfare, 
cholera, and appalling losses, the Allied siege of Sebastopol finally succeeded. 
The Peace of Paris (1856) neutralized the Black Sea, imposed a joint European 
protectorate over the Ottoman Christians, and guaranteed the integrity of both 
the Ottoman Empire and the principalities. [Abkhazia] 

None the less, the Russians were back in the Balkans within twenty years. 
On this occasion, the opening was provided by simultaneous revolts in three 
Ottoman provinces-in Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Bulgaria. Military 
intervention by Serbia and Montenegro, diplomatic meddling by Austria, and the 
murder of 136 Turkish officials in Bulgaria elicited a ferocious Ottoman 
response. In May 1876 over 20,000 peasants were slaughtered in the notorious 
Bulgarian Horrors. In London, Gladstone raged: 'Let the Turks now carry away 
their abuses in the only possible manner, namely by carrying off themselves.' In 
Constantinople, two successive sultans were overthrown. In St Petersburg, the 
Tsar felt duty-bound to protect the Balkan Christians. Two international 
conferences were convened to impose conditions on the new Sultan, Abdul 
Hamid II the Damned (r. 1876-1909), who baffled them all by promises of a 
parliamentary constitution. In April 1877 Russian armies invaded Ottoman 
territory on the Danube and in Armenia. Their advance was long delayed by 
stout Turkish resistance on the Balkan passes; but by January 1878 the Cossacks 
were threatening the walls of Constantinople. By the Treaty of San Stefano 
(1878) the Porte was obliged to accept the Tsar's stiff terms, including the 
creation of an independent 'Greater Bulgaria' of alarming proportions (see 
Appendix III, p. 1245). 

The Congress of Berlin, 13 June-13 July 1878, was convened to satisfy 
British and Austrian demands for the revision of the San Stefano Treaty and the 
curtailment of Russian ambitions. It was a grand diplomatic occasion, the last 
when all the European Powers could meet to settle their differences on equal 
terms. With Bismarck in the chair as the self-styled 'honest broker', it marked 



united Germany's supreme status in Europe; and it drew the sting of the war 
fever, which filled the London music halls: 

We don't want to fight, but by jingo if we do, 

We've got the ships, we've got the men, we've got the 
money too. 

We've fought the Bear before, and while Britons will be 
true, 

The Russians shall not have Constantinople! - 

In many respects, however, the Congress exemplified the most cynical 
aspects of the European power game. None of the Balkan peoples was 
effectively represented.None was treated with consideration: Bosnia and 
Herzegovina were handed over to Austrian occupation; Bulgaria was split in 
two, and excluded from the Aegean; Serbia, Montenegro, and Romania, 
patronizingly confirmed in their independence, were all refused the pieces of 
territory which they thought most important. The Powers, in contrast, simply 
helped themselves: Russia, denied the Straits, took Bessarabia from her 
Romanian ally; Britain took Cyprus from her Ottoman client; Austria took the 
Sanjak of Novi Bazar; Disraeli left Berlin claiming 'Peace with Honour'. Not 
surprisingly, the Balkan nations were soon seeking their own, often violent 
solutions. The Powers abandoned the Concert, and sought security in bilateral 
treaties and alliances. The brakes were removed from the pursuit of national 
interest at all levels. 

Land forces still provided the key to Continental politics. So long as this held 
true, it was possible to discern that Germany and Russia would be bound to play 
the preponderant roles in any generalized conflict. Of the five European Powers, 
three had serious military defects. Britain possessed a mighty navy but no 
conscript army. France was suffering a catastrophic fall in the birth rate that 
seriously threatened the supply of conscripts. The Austro-Hungarian army was 
technically and psychologically dependent on Germany. 

The formation of two opposing diplomatic and military blocs took place over 
three decades. At first, Britain and France were kept apart by colonial rivalry, 
Britain and Russia by mutual suspicions over central Asia, Russia and France by 
tsarist-republican animosities. So for a time Bismarck was free to construct a 
system that would protect Germany from French revenge. In 1879 he forged the 
Dual Alliance with Austria, in 1881-7 the Dreikaiserbund of Germany, Austria, 
and Russia, from 1882 the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria, and Italy, in 


1884-7 and 1887-90 the two 'reinsurance treaties' with Russia. Yet the logic of 
Europe's two most intense political passions-France's loathing for Germany 
and Russia's longing for the Straits-was sure to assert itself. France was bound 
to seek escape from the web which Bismarck had so brilliantly woven; and 
Russia was bound to chafe at the check on her Balkan ambitions. Hence, in the 
years after Bismarck's dismissal, Russia's relations with Germany cooled: and 
the Tsar looked for new partners. In 1893, with French banks already investing 
heavily in Russian concerns, the Franco-Russian Alliance was signed between 
Paris and St Petersburg. At a stroke, France escaped from isolation, regained her 
confidence, and threatened Germany from both sides. In 1904, France settled her 
differences with Britain, and entered the Entente Cordiale. In 1907, after the 
Anglo-Russian agreement over Persia, the way was finally opened for the Triple 
Entente of France, Britain, and Russia. 

At the time, it may have seemed that Europe's diplomatic kaleidoscope had 
thrown up just another temporary constellation. Both the Triple Alliance and the 
Triple Entente were essentially defensive in nature; and there were still several 
loose ends. Both Britain and Germany, for example, were still hoping to reach an 
accommodation, despite their differences. In fact, with the West and East 
combining against the Centre, the Powers had manoeuvred themselves into a 
strategic configuration whose stresses were to be played out for the rest of the 
twentieth century. Almost without noticing, Europe had divided itself into two 
massive armed camps; and there was no 'honest broker' left. (See Appendix III, 
p. 1312) 

Developments in military technology remained sluggish through much of the 
century, though important organizational and logistical changes took place. 
Railways revolutionized the existing methods of transport, mobilization, and 
supply. The work of the General Staffs was redesigned on the Prussian model in 
order to deal with the permanent flow of conscripts. But apart from their rifled 
percussion muskets, the armies of the Crimea were much like those of Austerlitz. 
The effect of rifled barrels was felt only gradually, first in the Prussian Dreyse 
needle gun of 1866, then in the superior French chassepot rifle and the Krupp 
breech-loading cannon of 1870. In naval design, steam-driven and armour-plated 
warships came into vogue. Yet the thorough exploitation of modern machines 
and modern chemicals had to await the advent in the 1880s of high explosives, 
the machine-gun, and long-range artillery, [nobel] 

Despite the absence of major engagements after 1871, it is not true to say 



that military theorists failed to consider the impact of the new weapons. One 
writer, the Polish railway magnate Jan Bloch, argued in La Guerre future (1898) 
that offensive war had ceased to be a viable proposition. The reaction of most 
generals was to demand the supply of more troops.- As the numbers multiplied, 
and battlefield prognosis promised stalemate, the realization dawned that 
mobilization procedures might provide the key to victory. General mobilization 
was judged more threatening than mere declarations of war. Yet there were few 
signs of urgency. In the heyday of imperialism, Europe's armies were much 
more likely to be facing spear-carrying tribesmen than each other. 

None the less, a growing awareness of the potential for large-scale conflict 
gave rise to the science of geopolitics. The tentacles of imperial power circled a 
globe that was now criss-crossed by world-wide communications. It was only to 
be expected that military and political strategists should begin to think in global 
terms. In his seminal lecture The Geographical Pivot of History' (1904), 
Halford Mackinder (1861-1947), Oxford's first Professor of Geography, 
remarked that there was no more virgin territory into which the empires could 
expand. So competition over existing resources was bound to intensify. The 
progress of that competition would be constrained both by the distribution of 
population and by the configuration of the continents. In a sensational map 
entitled The Natural Seats of Power', he marked out Eurasian Russia as the 
location of the world's supreme natural fortress. This 'heartland' was ringed by 
an 'inner crescent' of semi-continental powers from Britain to China, and by an 
oceanic 'outer crescent' linking the Americas with Africa, Australasia, and 
Japan. In the first instance, his aim was to warn the Western powers against a 
possible conjunction of Russia with Germany. At a later stage, when advocating 
the creation of a belt of strong new states to keep Russia and Germany apart, he 
coined the famous formula: 

Who rules eastern Europe, commands the Heartland; 

Who rules the Heartland, commands the World-island; 

Who rules the World-Island, commands the World.- 


NOBEL 


It is a supreme irony that the world's most prestigious prizes for achieve-I 





ment in physics, chemistry, literature, medicine, and, above all, peace should 
have been funded from the profits of armaments. Alfred Bernhard Nobel 
(1833-96) was a Swede who grew up in St Petersburg, where his father had 
founded a torpedo works. Trained as a chemist, he returned to Sweden to 
work on the improvement of explosives. After first producing nitroglycerine, 
he then invented dynamite (1867), gelignite (1876), and bal-listite (1889), 
the precursor of cordite gunpowder. The family firm grew immensely rich 
from their manufacture of explosives and from their development of the 
Baku oilfields. Always a man of pacifist views, Nobel founded the five 
prizes which bear his name by testamentary bequest. In the first nine decades 
of the Nobel Peace Prize, and presumably because Europe had urgent need 
for peacemakers, the great majority of prizewinners were Europeans:

Of all the recipients, only two, both Germans, were made to suffer for their 
support of peace. Ludwig Ouidde (1858-1941) had been jailed for opposing 
German rearmament. Carl von Ossetzky (1889-1939), leader of the German 



peace movement, died in a Nazi concentration camp. 


Mackinder's ideas were destined to be taken very seriously in Germany, as 
they were, in the subsequent era of air power, in the USA. 

In the first dozen years of the twentieth century, the long European peace still 
held. But fears began to be expressed about its fragility. Franco-German rivalry, 
recurrent Balkan crises, antagonistic diplomatic blocks, imperialist frictions, and 
the naval arms race all combined to raise the temperature of international 
relations. One alarm sounded in Bosnia in 1908, another at Agadir in 1911. 
Whilst all the Powers professed a desire for continued peace, all were preparing 
for war. [eulenberg] 

The Bosnian crisis indicated where Europe's most likely flash-point lay. 
Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia in 1908 without a shred of legal justification, 
having occupied and administered the country for the previous thirty years by 
international mandate. But Kaiser Wilhelm declared that he would fight at 
Austria's side 'like a knight in shining armour'; and the Powers felt unable to 
intervene. Austria's demarche robbed Belgrade of its hopes of a Greater Serbia, 
and served notice on Russia about further meddling. It was also a factor in the 
revolt of the 'Young Turks' who in 1908-9 took over the Ottoman government, 
throwing themselves into a programme of nationalism and modernization. 
Above all, it convinced the Balkan states that their differences could only be 
settled among themselves and by force. 

In 1912-13 three regional wars were fought in the Balkans. In May 1912 
Italy attacked the Ottoman Empire, seizing Rhodes, Tripoli, and Cyrenaica. In 
October 1912, with the Porte diverted by a rising in Albania, the Balkan League 
of Montenegro, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece took the offensive against the 
Ottomans in Macedonia. In June 1913 Bulgaria attacked Serbia to start the 
Balkan War of Partition. On each occasion, international conferences were held 
and treaties were signed. Albania emerged as a sovereign state, but Macedonia 
did not. Austrian gambling paid off. Germany's influence in Turkey greatly 
increased. Russian ambitions remained unsatisfied. The Eastern Question stayed 
unresolved (see Appendix III, p. 1309). [makedon] [shqiperia] 

In a climate of growing unease, serious thought was given to the task of 
minimizing international conflict. In the absence of government leadership, a 
number of private initiatives gave rise to agencies such as the Institute of 




International Law (1873), the Inter-parliamentary Union (1887), and the Nobel 
Committee. After a long period of gestation which began in 1843, when the first 
Peace Congress had been held in London, an International Peace Bureau began 
to operate regularly from 1891 out of Berne in Switzerland, co-ordinating 
national branches and organizing meetings. Pacifist opinions were given 
publicity from various quarters including the Swiss jurist J. K. Bluntschli (1808- 
81), the German Bertha von Suttner (1843-1914), the Austrian A. H. Fried 
(1864-1921), the French socialist Jean Jaures, and the English economist 
Norman Angeli (1873-1967). Angeli's The Great Illusion (1910) argued that the 
economic interest of nations had rendered war redundant, [nobel] 

Yet the most successful appeal for action came from the Tsar of Russia. 
Following his intervention, two massive peace conferences assembled at The 
Hague in 1899 and 1907 to discuss disarmament, the arbitration of international 
disputes, and the rules of land warfare. Practical results were not lacking. The 
International Court of Justice came into being in 1900, and the Hague 
Convention in 1907. A maritime conference assembled in London in 1908-9. 

But pacifism enjoyed general support neither among the citizens nor the 
politicians of the leading states. The ethos of unrestrained state power was 
deeply rooted. As Field Marshal von Moltke had written in response to 
Bluntschli: 

Perpetual peace is a dream, and not even a beautiful dream. War is part of God's order. Without war, the 
world would stagnate and lose itself in materialism. In it, Man's most noble virtues are displayed-courage 
and self-denial, devotion to duty, willingness to sacrifice oneself, and to risk life itself.- 

Similar sentiments were voiced in France and Britain. Jaures would be murdered 
on 31 July 1914 on the grounds that pacifism was treason. 

At the same time, the generals were coming to recognize that the destructive¬ 
ness of a future war would far exceed anything previously known, and that the 
Powers would embark on it at their peril. In his last address to the Reichstag in 
May 1890, the ageing Moltke issued a grave warning: 

If this war were to break out, no one could foresee how long it would last nor how it would end ... 
Gentlemen, it could be a Seven Years' War; it could be a Thirty Years' War; and woe to the man who ... 
first throws the match into the powder keg.- 

As a result, the military staffs of Europe were torn between the prevailing 
spirit of militarism and the growing counsels of prudence. They then followed 


the most dangerous of all courses. They accelerated their preparations for war, 
assembling huge arsenals and training vast conscript armies, whilst carefully 
avoiding conflict for decade after decade. The cauldron of rivalries, fears, and 
hatreds steadily raised an explosive head of steam. 

The cauldron's lid was eventually blown off by another assassination, a 
month before that of Jaures. On 28 June 1914 the heir to the throne of Austria- 
Hungary, Archduke Francis-Ferdinand of Austria-Este, was paying an official 
visit to the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo. Accompanied by his morganatic Czech 
wife, Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, he had disregarded all warnings, having 
deliberately timed his visit to coincide with the Serbian National Festival of 
Vidovdan (St Vitus' Day), the anniversary of the Battle of Kossovo (See Chapter 
VI). In Serbian eyes, it was a calculated insult. In consequence, the crowds 
which lined the streets of Sarajevo concealed a group of young assassins sent by 
one of the secret Serb societies opposing Habsburg rule, the Black Hand. 

In the morning, the Archduke's car, a Graf und Stift (1910) 28 h.p., took an 
unexpected route; and the visitors arrived safely for lunch at the city hall, where 
Sophie received a delegation of Muslim ladies. A bomb had been thrown, but the 
explosion caused no injuries and a man was arrested. After lunch, however, the 
Archduke's driver took a wrong turning. In his efforts to change direction, he 
reversed the open vehicle and its passengers right up to a spot beside another 
conspirator, a 19-year-old consumptive student, Gavrilo Princip. Fired at point- 
blank range, the bullets of Princip's revolver mortally wounded the imperial 
couple. Francis-Ferdinand murmured 'Sopherl, Sopherl! Sterbe nicht! Bleibe am 
Leben fur unsere Kinder!' (Sophie dear, don't die! Stay alive for our children!) 
But Sophie was dead. And her husband died within the hour. They would be 
buried at the dead of night in the chapel of their house at Arstetten on the 
Danube. Their car, and their blood-soaked clothing, would be preserved at the 
Army Museum in Vienna.- [konopiiite] 


EULENBERG 

On 23 October 1907 the case of Moltke v. Harden opened in a Berlin court. 
It was the first of six highly publicized trials known collectively as The 
Eulenburg Affair'. It exposed a widespread homosexual network in the 





Kaiser's immediate entourage. 

In Germany, as elsewhere, male sodomy was illegal. Paragraph 175 of 
the penal code punished 'unnatural vice' between men with 1-5 years' 
imprisonment. General Kuno von Moltke had sued the editor of the journal, 
Die Zukunft (The Future), Maximilian Harden, for publishing material which 
ridiculed two high-ranking courtiers named only as 'Sweetie' and 'the 
Harpist'. Moltke claimed that he and his friend, Philip, Prince von 
Eulenburg, had been libelled. Lurid details were aired in open court, 
especially by Eulenburg's ex-wife and by a soldier called Bollhardt. But the 
key evidence came from Dr Magnus Hirschfeld, a professional sexologist. 
Latent homosexuality, he explained, was not in itself illegal, though the 
practice of sodomy was. The court accepted Harden's defence that the 
plaintiff's homosexuality was manifest, but that no breach of Paragraph 175 
had been implied. 1 

The political implications were grave. Moltke was the military 
commandant of Berlin. Eulenburg, sometime ambassador to Vienna, was 
especially close to the Kaiser and openly aspired to the Chancellorship. Both 
Harden and Hirschfeld held liberal views, and opposed the Kaiser's foreign 
policy. Both were campaigning for the repeal of Paragraph 175, and both 
were Jews. The imperial establishment felt itself to be under attack from 
treasonable elements. 

In later rounds of the scandal Chancellor von Bulow sued another liberal 
editor, Adolf Brand; the chief of the Kaiser's military secretariat, Count von 
Huelsen-Haeseler, dropped dead in the Kaiser's presence dressed in a tutu in 
the middle of a drag act; and the Moltke/Harden case was twice retried. The 
Potsdam garrison was shaken by a series of courts martial for sodomy, and 
by a rash of associated suicides. (The tight white breeches and thigh-length 
boots of the cuirassiers had been singled out in court as specially 
provocative.) Harden's legal costs were secretly refunded by the imperial 
chancellery. Eulenburg was ruined. Despite a lifetime of licence, he 
protested his innocence. But he was condemned on charges of perjury, and 
only avoided arrest through a stream of feigned illnesses and legal 
postponements that continued to 1918. 

Germany was not alone in its experience of salacious scandals with political 
overtones. In that same era, Britain was rocked both by the trial of Oscar 



Wilde and by the tragedy of Sir Roger Casement, who was executed for 
treason. 2 In the 1920s, however, when Germany was humiliated by national 
defeat, the scars of the earlier sexual scandals ran deep. The circle of 
homosexuality-treason-Jewry was further implanted in the popular mind by 
a chain of associations which started with the murder of the finance minister, 
Walter Rathenau, a homosexual Jew, in 1922. In his memoirs, the Kaiser 
himself linked the catastrophe of the Great War to a conspiracy of 
'international Jewry' first revealed by Harden's accusations. Historians have 
linked the events of 1907-9 to the Kaiser's increasing reliance on his 
generals, and to their policy of pre-emptive attack. 3 

The Nazi Party, whose propaganda fed on such matters, was peculiarly 
hostile to homosexuals. Dr Hirschfeld's Institute of Sexology was 
demolished by a Nazi mob as early as May 1933. The Gestapo decimated 
Berlin's large homosexual community through a series of raids immediately 
before the Olympic Games in 1936. The lot of the 'Pink Triangles' in the 
concentration camps must be placed high on the list of Nazi crimes. 4 
Paragraph 175 was finally abolished in 1969. 


Within four weeks, the gunshots of Sarajevo brought Europe's diplomatic 
and military restraints crashing to the ground. Ultimata, mobilization orders, and 
declarations of war ricocheted round the chancelleries. Vienna wanted action 
against Serbia, and was given carte blanche by Berlin. On 23 July an ultimatum 
was delivered to Belgrade, demanding Austrian participation in the pursuit of the 
assassins. The Serbian government prevaricated, and ordered partial 
mobilization. On the 25th, Russia's Imperial Council decided to give support to 
Serbia, but failed to consult either Britain or France about it. On the 28th, 
Austria-Hungary officially declared war on Serbia. Thereon Russia mobilized, 
prompting Germany to issue ultimata first to Russia and then to France. Thanks 
to the war-plan of General Schlieffen, the German General Staff needed to be 
assured that they would not be trapped by a simultaneous attack on two fronts. 
The die was cast. When the two ultimata evoked no response, the Kaiser 
followed his generals' advice that the safety of the Reich permitted no delay. On 
1 August Germany declared war on Russia, and on the 3rd on France. On the 
latter date, since German troops had crossed the Belgian frontier on their way 
into France, the British government sent an ultimatum to Berlin. The five 




European powers were embarking on the general war which they had studiously 
avoided for ninety-nine years. 


KONOPinTE 

The castle of Konopiste (formerly Konopischt) lies deep in the pine-woods 
of central Bohemia. In the 1890s, when it served as the favourite hunting- 
lodge of Archduke Francis Ferdinand, it was fitted out in sumptuous leather 
and mahogany. It housed the Archduke's enormous collection of game 
trophies. It was, and still is, an elegant charnel-house, crammed with 
everything from elephants' tusks to reindeer antlers. It later appealed as a 
rest home for the Nazi SS, who chose to paint it black. 

Archduke Francis-Ferdinand is remembered for four things. First, by 
morganatically marrying a Czech Countess, Sophie von Chotek, he was 
obliged to surrender his children's rights of succession. Secondly, with 
Sophie's approval, he was'a determined champion of the narrow (Catholic) 
bigotry that, in Austria, went under the name of religion'. 1 Third, he wanted 
to transform the Dual Monarchy into a federation of equal nations. Fourthly, 
by scorning advice to steer clear of Bosnia in the summer of 1914, he helped 
lay the fuse which detonated the First World War. 

Francis-Ferdinand's assassination was the third in a series of family 
killings. He had become imperial heir twenty-five years earlier through the 
death of his cousin Rudolf. Rudolf had been deeply disturbed by the 
conflicting influences of an ultra-traditionalist father, the Emperor Francis- 
Joseph, and of a wilful and wayward mother, the Empress Elizabeth. 
Passionately anti-clerical, he had once written in a notebook: 'Are we higher 
spirits or animals? We are animals ...' 2 He shot himself and his lover of 
seventeen days, Maria Vetsera, at another Habsburg shooting-lodge, at 
Mayerling in Austria in 1889. The Empress Elizabeth was stabbed to death 
by an anarchist in Geneva in 1898. 

Few sources stress Francis-Ferdinand's passion for hunting. Yet he 
scoured the globe for species to kill with a zeal that far exceeded the social 
demands of his day. He was an early adept of the machine-gun, and would 
have all the animals of the forest driven into his sights. Two of his trips to 




Poland sufficed to bring the European bison to the point of extinction. He 
ordered the remains of his victims to be carefully preserved. At KonopiSte 
their bodies were stuffed and mounted under glass in their thousands; their 
heads hung on the walls; their teeth, meticulously repaired by the imperial 
dentist, packed into row upon row of display cabinets. 

The Archduke left Konopiste with his wife on 23 June 1914, heading for 
Sarajevo. When he was killed, the Emperor was said to have breathed a sigh 
of relief. 'God permits no challenge,' he muttered to his aide-decamp; 'a 
Higher Power has re-established the order which I had no longer been able 
to maintain.' 3 This epitaph is generally thought to refer to the Archduke's 
morganatic marriage. It might equally apply to the wilful slaughter of 
helpless creatures. 


Monday, 3 August 1914, The Foreign Office, Whitehall, London swi. The 

British Foreign Secretary was looking from his study onto a peaceful summer's 
evening. Sir Edward Grey was responsible for the international relations of the 
largest Empire in history. Austria was fighting Serbia. Two days ago, Germany 
had declared war on Russia and France had mobilised; German troops had 
occupied Luxemburg, and were poised to attack Belgium; Russian troops had 
entered East Prussia. But Britain was still at peace. After a long speech in the 
House of Commons, Sir Edward had just helped the Prime Minister, Henry 
Asquith, to draft an ultimatum to be sent to Berlin if Belgium were invaded. It 
must have been 8 or 9 p.m., for he remembered the lamplighter turning up the 
gaslamps in the courtyard below. He turned to a friend who was with him and 
who later recalled his words: The lamps are going out all over Europe. I doubt 
that we shall see them lit again in our lifetime.' The scene is one of the most 
famous in British history, described in numberless textbooks. The words are 
cited in almost all anthologies of quotations. - 

Unfortunately, Sir Edward's memoirs did not entirely confirm the story: 

My recollection of those three days, August 1,2 and 3, is one of almost continuous cabinets and of immense 
strain; but of what passed in discussion very little remains in my mind... There was little for me to do; 
circumstances and events were compelling decision... 

A friend came to see me on one of the evenings of the last week-he thinks it 
was on Monday, August 3rd. We were standing at a window of my room in the 





Foreign Office. It was getting dusk, and the lamps were being lit in the space 
below... My friend recalls that I remarked on this with the words, The lamps 
are going out all over Europe: we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.'- 

What exactly transpired is rather puzzling. It is strange that a metaphor about 
lamps being extinguished should have been prompted by the sight of lamps 
being lit. Grey's most meticulous political biographer makes no mention of the 
scene.- What is more, on the very eve of war, when diplomacy was supposedly 
at its most intense, the man at the eye of the storm had 'little to do'. He had time 
to receive a friend, and to have a conversation of such little consequence that he 
could not remember the details. 

That same evening, Berlin was facing the realization that its diplomats had just 
committed Germany to a war on two fronts and with no committed allies. In the 
Reichstag the Chancellor, Bethmann Hollweg, had blamed it all on Russia: 
'Russia has thrown a firebrand into our house,' he declared. In St Petersburg, 
where Germany's declaration of war had been received two days previously, the 
Tsar and his generals had already set the steamroller in motion. In Paris the 
French were reeling under Bethmann's unlikely accusation that a French plane 
had bombed Nuremberg. In Vienna, where the Austrian Government had been 
pursuing its attack on Serbia for the past week, the Emperor-King and his 
ministers were in no hurry to join another war against Russia. In Rome the third 
partner of the Triple Alliance was lying low. Only in Belgrade could one actually 
hear the sound of the guns. 



Map 23. 

Europe, 1914 

In the interminable debates about the causes of the Great War, the diplomatic 
system of the early twentieth century has often been made a prime culprit. It has 
been frequently asserted that the dice were weighted in favour of war through 
the logic of the two opposing blocs, the Alliance and the Entente. Vast political 
and economic forces had supposedly created a 'geopolitical consensus' in which 
both sides agreed about the necessity of supporting their allies and the dire 
consequences of inaction. This consensus allegedly tied the diplomats' hands, 





driving them inexorably along the fatal road from a minor Balkan incident to a 
global conflagration. This contention needs to be examined. The Central Powers 
were bound in advance by the Triple Alliance. Germany was indeed obliged to 
assist its Austrian ally, if Austria had been attacked. But Austria had not been 
attacked, and Vienna was not able to invoke the terms of the existing treaties. 
The assassination at Sarajevo could not be construed as an act of war against 
Austria, especially after Belgrade's conciliatory response to the Austrian 
ultimatum. What is more, Germany was painfully aware that her third ally, Italy, 
would never take up arms in defence of Austria unless absolutely forced to do 
so. Austria's determination to punish Serbia, therefore, and her request for 
German approval cannot be attributed to the requirements of the Triple Alliance. 

In the case of the Triple Entente, the chain of obligations was still looser. The 
Entente was not an Alliance. Russia and France were indeed obliged by treaty to 
assist each other if attacked; but they were painfully aware that the third member 
of the Entente, Great Britain, was not formally obliged to take up arms in their 
defence. What is more, since none of the Entente Powers was formally allied to 
Belgrade, an Austrian attack on Serbia could not be construed as a casus belli. In 
particular, there was no Russo-Serbian treaty in force.- By the Treaty of 1839, 
Britain was committed to uphold the independence of Belgium. But that was an 
old obligation which long preceded the undertakings of the Entente. Despite 
appearances, therefore, the diplomatic system of 1914 left the governments 
considerable room for manoeuvre. It did not oblige Germany to support Austria 
in all circumstances, or Russia to support Serbia, or Britain to support Russia 
and France. Almost all the key decisions were justified in terms of'honour' or 
'friendship' or 'fear' or 'expediency', not of treaties. In which case it is 
appropriate to look less at the diplomatic system and more at the diplomats. 

Sir Edward Grey (1862-1933), later Earl Grey of Fallodon, was a 
quintessential English gentleman. Handsome, modest, and retiring, he was 
imbued with the spirit of patriotic service. G. B. Shaw mischievously called him 
a 'typical British Junker'. He was descended from a county family in 
Northumberland which came to prominence first through the exploits of a 
soldier forebear on the battlefield of Minden in 1759, and later through the 
whiggish 2nd Earl, a sponsor of the Great Reform Bill of 1832. The family was 
best known from the perfumed brand of Indian tea which was named in the 2nd 
Earl's honour. Sir Edward himself was just old enough to remember the Franco- 
Prussian war. When at the age of 8 he asked his father which side Britain 
favoured, he was told: 'The Germans'. He was sent with his two brothers to 


board at Winchester, before proceeding via Balliol College, Oxford, to an 
impeccable career as Liberal MP for North Berwick, Under-Secretary at the 
Foreign Office 1892-5, and Foreign Secretary in Asquith's Liberal Government 
from 1906 to 1916.- 

Grey's lifestyle was simplicity itself. He was deeply devoted to his wife, 
Dorothy, with whom he shared a passion for nature and to wfibm he 
corresponded, when separated, on every single day of their marriage. With her 
he remodelled the estate at Fallodon, creating an extensive wildfowl reserve. He 
was an habitual angler and bird-watcher, and an accomplished poetical scholar. 
When working in London, it was part of his sacred routine to catch the 6 o'clock 
train from Waterloo every Saturday morning, and to spend a weekend's fishing 
near his cottage at Itchen Abbas in Hampshire. 'He would much rather catch a 3 
lb trout on the dry fly than make a highly successful speech in the House of 
Commons.'- 

Grey was destined to write at length about these simple joys. He published 
books on fly-fishing, on the waterfowl at Fallodon, and on Wordsworth's 
Prelude. 

That serene and blessed mood 
In which ... 

... we are laid asleep 

In body, and become a living soul. 

With an eye made quiet by the power 
Of harmony, and the deep power of joy, 

We see into the life of things. 

As a guest lecturer in America, he once chose the subject of 'Recreation'. He 
recounted the story how, as Foreign Secretary, he had entertained the ex- 
President, Theodore Roosevelt, whom he had taken on a twenty-hour trip 
through the Hampshire countryside. The visitor was a keen ornithologist with a 
fine ear for birdsong. Grey was greatly impressed when Roosevelt unhesitatingly 
picked out the call of a gold-crested wren-the only member of the species that 
is common to England and America. 'We are listening today', he had said, 'to 
songs which must have been familiar to races of men of which history has no 
record.'- 

Grey was not the typical imperialist or globe-trotting diplomat. Unlike his 
two brothers, one of whom was killed in Africa by a lion and the other by a 


buffalo, he saw little of the British Empire. Though he read French, he spoke no 
foreign languages; and, with the exception of Continental vacations, he knew no 
foreign countries well. He was deeply imbued with the spirit of the 'splendid 
isolation' of the 1890s, when he had first entered foreign relations. He saw no 
reason why Britain should become unduly involved in Europe's affairs. His 
watchwords were 'No commitments' and 'Our hands must be free'. In 1914, at 
52, Grey's personal life was blighted. His wife had been killed in a carriage 
accident eight years before. He communed with nature alone, and with failing 
eyesight. He could not read papers easily: he had cataracts and deteriorating 
damage to the retina. But for the pressure of business, he would have gone in the 
summer of 1914 to consult an oculist in Germany. 

Grey's views on Germany were not hostile. He was not really hostile towards 
anything. But he felt uneasy about German ambitions. Contrary to talk of 
colonial rivalry, and of Germany's desire for 'a place in the sun', he judged that 
the Kaiser's ambitions were directed elsewhere. 'What Germany really wanted', 
he wrote after the war, 'was a place in a temperate climate and a fertile land 
which could be peopled by her white population... under the German flag. We 
had no such place to offer.'- He did not approve; on the other hand, German 
designs on Eastern Europe did not pose a threat to the British Empire. 

Most of the news in the month following Sarajevo had little to do with the 
European crisis. On the afternoon that the Archduke was shot, Baron de 
Rothschild's Sardanapale won the Grand Prix de Paris by a neck. Britain's 
calendar for July 1914 was filled with the usual summer announcements: 

2 Death of Joseph Chamberlain. 

3 At Christie's, Corot's Le Rond des Nymphes realized 6,600 guineas. 

4 Harvard won the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley Regatta.

26 The Scottish Borderers' Regiment fires on a crowd at Howth following an 
Irish gun-running incident. 

31 Jean Jaures, French socialist leader, was murdered in Paris. On 1 August Sir 
Ernest Shackleton's Expedition sailed for Antarctica.- 

The first sign of real trouble in London came on 31 July, when the Stock 
Exchange was closed and the bank rate raised to 8 per cent. On Sunday, 2 
August, 'prayers for the nation' were ofFered in all churches and chapels of the 
United Kingdom. Ominously, on 3 August Cowes Regatta was cancelled. 

Grey's performance during the crisis of 1914 attracted both praise and scorn. 
Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, was an admirer: 

[Grey] plunged into his immense double struggle a) to prevent war, and b) not to desert France should war 
come. I watched... his cool skill... with admiration. He had to make the Germans realise we were to be 
reckoned with, without making France or Russia feel that we were in their pocket.- 

The Manchester Guardian, Britain's leading Liberal paper, strongly disagreed. 
Having expected Britain to stay neutral, it was horrified when war was declared. 
'For years', it cried, '[Grey] has been holding back the whole truth.'- 

David Lloyd George, Chancellor of the Exchequer, was also very critical. At 
the start of 1914 he had argued for a reduction in arms expenditure, believing 
that Anglo-German relations were 'far more friendly than for years past'. 'Grey 
was the most insular of our statesmen,' he later wrote. 'Northumberland was 
good enough for him...' And he pointed to what he considered the fatal flaw: 
'Had he [Grey] warned Germany in time of the point at which Britain would 
declare war ... the issue would have been different.'- 

In Germany, similar criticisms were expressed in harsher language. Many 
believed that Grey was 'the bungler', 'the wily hypocrite', 'the chief architect of 
the war', who dragged Germany down. Even those Germans who appreciated 
Grey's goodwill judged him severely. '[Sir Edward] imagined that he was 
steering his ship with a sure hand, unaware that other hands were on the wheel.' 
He was 'a man with two sets of human values ... a double morality'.- 

After the war Grey did not mention collective guilt, still less the faults of the 
diplomats. Instead, he recounted an anecdote about Japan. 'We used to be a 
nation of artists,' a Japanese diplomat once told him; 'but now... we have 


learned to kill, you say that we are civilized.'- 

Sir Edward's road to war began very late-in the last week of July. On the 25th 
he travelled as usual for a weekend's fishing at Itchen Abbas-'with unflappable 
sangfroid ... or with culpable disregard of duty'.- At that stage, 'he had no 
thoughts of war.' His initial sympathies had lain with Austria, and to him things 
only seemed to slide when Austria spurned Serbia's conciliatory stance. He was 
convinced that the powers would 'recoil from the abyss'; that Britain was bound 
to support France if war came; that Britain, however, should give no pledge it 
could not fulfil; and, therefore, that we (the British Government) 'must address 
ourselves to Germany'. On the 26th, after dining with Viscount Haldane, he 
talked with an informal German emissary, Ballin, who reported back that Britain 
would stay neutral unless Belgium was completely 'swallowed'. On the 27th he 
proposed an international conference, but found that the proposal was not taken 
up. 

On the 31st, when Germany and Russia were both mobilizing, Grey had still 
made no positive commitments to anyone, though he had rejected a German 
proposal for a non-aggression treaty (see below). On Saturday, 1 August, since 
he had cancelled his trip to Hampshire, he dined at Brooks's Club, where he was 
seen playing billiards. On the 2nd he attended a Sunday Cabinet meeting, an 
unheard-of event, where ministers came to no definite conclusion about the 
consequences of a German invasion of Belgium. Several ministers, including 
Morley, the Lord President, and John Burns, President of the Board of Trade, 
gave notice of resigning if Britain did not stay neutral. 

Sir Edward's timetable on 3 August started with another morning Cabinet. At 
2 p.m., after lunch, he went to the Foreign Office to meet the German 
Ambassador, Prince Lichnowsky, who informed him that the invasion of 
Belgium was imminent, and asked in return for the drift of Sir Edward's speech 
due within the hour. Grey declined to divulge this, then he crossed the street to 
the Palace of Westminster and at 3 p.m. rose to speak: 


Last week, I stated that we were working... to preserve the peace of Europe. Today... it is clear that the 
peace of Europe cannot be preserved. Russia and Germany at any rate have declared war. 


Sir Edward explained that Britain still possessed the freedom to decide its policy. 
Britain was not a party to the Franco-Russian Alliance, and 'did not even know 



[its] terms'. However, in outlining the factors which would determine British 
action, he started by expressing sympathy for the predicament of the French. 'No 
country or Government has less desire to be involved in war over a dispute 
between Austria and Serbia than France. They are involved in it through an 
obligation of honour... under a definite alliance with Russia.' In listing Britain's 
interests, he made special mention of the English Channel and the Anglo- 
Belgian Treaty of 1839. From this he concluded that Britain's 'unconditional 
neutrality' would not be an acceptable stance. Thanks to the Navy, Britain did 
not stand to suffer much more by entering the war than by standing aside. But 
British prestige would be severely damaged if the 'obligations of honour and 
interest' were disregarded. He was confident that Britain would not flinch from 
its duty: 


If, as seems not improbable, we are forced to take our stand on these issues, then I believe ... that we shall 
be supported by the determination, the resolution, the courage and the endurance of the whole country.- 

Though the language was vague, Sir Edward had finally told the world that 
Britain's continuing neutrality was conditional on Germany withdrawing the 
threat to Belgium and the Channel ports. 

After his speech Sir Edward was approached by Winston Churchill, who 
said, 'What next?' 'Now we shall send them an ultimatum to stop the invasion of 
Belgium within 24 hours.'- In the Prime Minister's office in the Commons, 
Asquith was visited by his wife. 'So it's all up?' she said. 'Yes, it's all up.' 
'Henry sat at his writing table, leaning back, pen in hand ... I got up and leant 
my head against his. We could not speak for tears.'- 

In 1914 Britain's defences depended almost entirely on the Fleet. Neither the 
First Lord of the Admiralty nor the First Sea Lord, Prince Louis Battenberg, had 
favoured war. But Prince Louis had stopped the Fleet's dispersal after the 
summer's manoeuvres, and on 2 August he had recommended full naval 
mobilization.- Churchill concurred. In the early hours of the 3rd, at his 
Admiralty desk, Churchill received a letter from his wife, who wrote that 'it 
would be a wicked war'. He replied: 


Cat-dear, It is all up. Germany has quenched the last hopes of peace by declaring war on Russia, and the 
declaration against France is momentarily expected. 

I profoundly understand your view. But the world has gone mad, and we must look after ourselves and 
our friends... Sweet-Cat, my tender love, Your devoted W. Kiss the kittens.- 


After talking to Grey, Churchill sent a note to the Prime Minister: 'Unless 
forbidden to do so, I shall put Anglo-French naval disposition into force to 
defend the Channel.'- 

Tuesday 4 August was a day of waiting in London. News arrived in the 
morning that German troops had crossed the Belgian frontier in force. Britain's 
ultimatum to Berlin was dispatched at 2 p.m., demanding a reply within the day. 
Asquith wrote to his intimate confidante, Venetia Stanley: 'Winston, who has put 
on all his warpaint, is spoiling for a sea fight...'- Two German ships, the 
Goeben and the Breslau, were steaming through the Mediterranean bound for 
Turkey. The British were confident of catching them. 

The ultimatum expired, unanswered, at 11 p.m.-midnight in Berlin. Fifteen 
minutes later the Cabinet convened at 10 Downing Street. The scene was later 
described by David Lloyd George in a private letter to Mrs Asquith: 

Winston dashed into the room radiant, his face bright, his manner keen, one word pouring out on another 
how he was going to send telegrams to the Med., to the North Sea, and God knows where. You could see he 
was a really happy man.- 

At which point the Admiralty sent the signal to all ships of the Fleet: 
'Commence hostilities at once with Germany.' Contrary to the inclination of its 
leading politicians, Britain had abandoned peaceful neutrality. The decision 
transformed a Continental war into a world-wide conflict. 

Britain's declaration of war put the final seal on the biggest diplomatic 
disaster of modern times. It completed the most dire of the scenarios which the 
diplomats had been contemplating over the previous month. It Was. the fourth 
such declaration in line-the first by Austria, the second and third by Germany. 
Britain was the only Entente Power to take the initiative in going to war. 

Four weeks earlier, when Vienna had demanded satisfaction from Belgrade 
over the assassination at Sarajevo, analysts could have foreseen that the 
European crisis could be resolved in one of four different ways. It might 
conceivably have been settled without war, as had happened in 1908 after the 
Bosnian affair. On the other hand, it might have produced a local war limited to 
Austria and Serbia. Thirdly, if the Great Powers did not show restraint, it might 
have sparked the Continental war for which both the current diplomatic alliances 
and the plans of the General Staffs had been designed. In this case Germany and 
Austria would have been pitted against Russia and France, and Britain would 
have remained neutral. Lastly, God forbid, it was just possible that Britain would 


become directly involved and that the controlled Continental war would be 
expanded into a totally uncontrolled global conflict. For this reason the 
diplomatic relations between London and Berlin were of greater import than 
those between Europe's other capitals. Vienna was the key to a local war, Berlin 
to the Continental war, London to global conflict. 

Any competent student could have listed the reasons why Britain's 
involvement raised very special complications. From the strategic point of view, 
Britain's assets were spread right round the globe, and their fate would not just 
affect the interests of the European states. From the political point of view, the 
British Empire in 1914 was still judged the world's greatest power, and war 
against Britain would be seen as a bid for world supremacy. From the economic 
point of view, Britain was still the capital of world finance. Though her technical 
and industrial strength was no longer the equivalent of Germany's, she could 
mobilize colossal resources. From the diplomatic point of view, the lofty 'lords 
of Albion' had never known defeat. They were noted for their ineffable self- 
confidence, for their obstinate sense of righteousness, and for their perfidy. 

Most importantly, from the purely military point of view, Britain represented 
a wild card, a spoiler, a participant whose impact was completely unpredictable. 
Thanks to naval supremacy, the British Isles could not be eliminated even by the 
most decisive of Continental campaigns. At the same time, Britain only 
possessed what the Kaiser was to call 'a contemptibly small army',- which could 
not play a major role on the Continent until gradually expanded by conscription. 
The British Government enjoyed the exceptional luxury of a position where 
sudden defeat did not come into the reckoning, and where a protracted war 
would see British military capacity steadily rising over a period of two or three 
years. 

These facts had clear consequences. If the Continental campaigns went well 
for France and Russia in the early stages, Britain's participation might well tip 
the balance in favour of a decisive victory. If things went well for the Central 
Powers, however, Berlin and Vienna could not count on any such favourable 
outcome. Even if the French and Russian armies were defeated in the first shock, 
the Central Powers, like Napoleonic France, would still be left facing a defiant 
and impregnable Britain, which would use all its wiles to mount new coalitions 
against them. If the initial fighting were inconclusive, Britain would be better 
placed than anyone to build up its relative strength in later phases. Unlike 
Germany, Britain had no chance of winning a Continental campaign; but she 


could not be easily defeated. In short, whatever happened, Britain had the 
capacity for mining the prospects for the quick 'limited war' of which all 
German generals dreamed. 

There was much talk at the time of militarism. Colonel House, the American, 
who visited Berlin in 1914, was shocked by the bombastic displays. Yet all the 
Powers cultivated a degree of military pomp and swagger; the differences were 
at best those of style. In all countries in 1914, unlike 1939, the military ethos was 
closely bound by a code of honour. A German observer remarked bitterly, 
'Militarism in the United Kingdom is regarded [by the British] as of God, and 
militarism in Germany as of the devil.'- Military technicalities were in play as 
well. One concerned the control of the English Channel. The British and French 
naval staffs had agreed in advance that the French fleet should be concentrated in 

the Mediterranean, whilst the Channel should be patrolled by the Royal 
Navy. This meant that British neutrality during a Franco-German campaign in 
Belgium would automatically give German warships a free run of the French and 
British coasts. Another important detail concerned mobilization procedures. 
German provisions envisaged a preparatory stage called 'a state of imminent 
war', to be followed by a second stage in which full mobilization could be 
completed almost immediately. In effect, a German declaration of 
Kriegsbereitschaft was equivalent to other countries' declarations of general 
mobilization. 

These were the matters to which Germany's diplomats, led by their Chancellor, 
Bethmann Hollweg, were required to turn their minds before forcing a 
showdown. 

Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg (1856-1920) was an archetypal Prussian 
civil servant. Teamed, polite, and earnest, he had spent his entire life in the 
upper echelons of the state bureaucracy. He was descended from a banking 
family from Frankfurt, which had moved to Berlin and been ennobled two 
generations back. They came to prominence through Theobald's grandfather, 
Moritz August, a law professor who had distinguished himself in the liberal 
opposition to Bismarck's regime. Theobald himself was just too young to have 
served in the Franco-Prussian War, which his grandfather had abhorred. He was 
sent with his brother, Max, to board at the Fiirstenschule Pforta, before 
proceeding via legal studies at Strasburg and Feipzig to success in the 
formidable civil service examinations. As a primus omnium at school, and with a 


Ph.D. in jurisprudence in his late twenties, he was perfectly prepared for a 
lightning ascent of the bureaucratic career ladder- Oberprasidialrat at Potsdam, 
Regierungsprasident at Bromberg (Bydgoszcz), Oberprasident or 'Provincial 
Governor' of Mark Brandenburg, Minister of the Interior in 1905, Vice- 
Chancellor in 1907, Imperial Chancellor and Prime Minister of Prussia from 
1909. From then until July 1917 he was responsible for all civilian policies, 
domestic and foreign, of Europe's most powerful state.- 

Bethmann Hollweg was not the typical Junker. He inherited a fine landed 
estate at Hohenfinow east of Berlin, but the Rittergutwas bought by his 
grandfather, not rooted in family tradition. He had served in the local regiment, 
the 15th Uhlans, but only for one year after leaving school. He came to be 
deeply attached to Hohenfinow-a three-storey red-brick pile set at the end of a 
long linden avenue amid 7,500 acres on a bluff overlooking the Oder. He 
adopted the motto Ego et domus mea serviemus domino (My house and I shall 
serve the Lord). But as a young man he had lived through years of restless, 
romantic wanderlust, reading poetry and rambling round the Eifel and the 
Siebengebirge with bohemian friends. He was embarrassed by his brother, who 
fled to sell real estate in Texas rather than face the state exams. He once stood 
for election to the Reichstag in the local constituency; but the narrow vote in his 
favour was overruled by the electoral commission on a technicality; and he never 
ventured into popular politics again. He married a somewhat unconventional 
girl, Martha Pfuel-Wilkendorf, who remarked, when he was offered the highest 
office in the Reich, 'Theo, dear, you can't do that!'- 

Bethmann's personality was anything but simple. He was a creature of 
routine, taking a hard morning's horse ride at 7 a.m. even in Berlin. But his 
orderly habits did not make for efficiency or decisiveness. He was extremely 
articulate and well informed; but he had a fatal tendency for procrastination, and 
repeatedly committed gaffes which a smarter politician would have avoided. He 
was particularly ill at ease in the military establishment which surrounded the 
Kaiser; yet he was also terrified of the Social Democrats, who held great sway in 
the subservient democratic sector of German politics. Much of the inside 
information about his chancellorship derives from the diary of his personal 
assistant, Kurt Riezler, who worked alongside him admiringly throughout the 
crisis of 1914. Riezler noted: 'His cunning is as great as his bungling.'- His 
biographer talks of his 'aggressively defensive self-consciousness'.- 

Bethmann owed his position partly to his seniority in the civil service and 


partly to the belief that he could hold the middle ground between the 
conservatives and the radicals. By German standards he was a very moderate 
conservative: in foreign policy he had frequently gone on record to state his 
commitment to peace, and to warn against the dangers of militarism. For this he 
was the bete noire of the Pan-German League, who often called for his 
dismissal. 

His guiding principle was supposedly Weltmacht una kein Krieg, 'World 
power but no war'. In the previous November he had reprimanded the Crown 
Prince for his lack of restraint: 'To rattle the sabre at every diplomatic 
entanglement... is not only blind but criminal.'- Pondering the prospects 
shortly after Sarajevo, he had confided to Riezler, 'Any general conflict [will 
lead] to a revolution of all existing conditions.'- Two weeks later, he had 
personally protested to the Kaiser about the bombastic statements of the Crown 
Prince and certain sections of the Press. 

In July 1914, at the age of 58, Bethmann's personal life had been blighted by 
the death of his wife only two months earlier. He travelled back and forth 
between Hohenfinow and Berlin alone, or with Riezler. Bethmann's feelings 
towards England were very friendly. His son Ernst, who was to be killed in the 
war, had been a Rhodes scholar at Oxford in 1908. Everything he said or wrote 
before the crisis underlined his wish and expectation for Anglo-German 
rapprochement. 

Bethmann's performance attracted little admiration, except from his 
immediate associates. Riezler admired his fortitude under pressure, and 
compared his 'scruples' to the 'icy hypocrisy' of Grey. 'The Chancellor is a child 
of the first half of the nineteenth century,' he noted, 'and the heir to a more 
idealistic culture.'- Yet the Kaiser was brutal: when things began to go wrong 
in mid-July and Bethmann offered to resign, the Kaiser apparently said, 'It's you 
that have cooked this soup, and now you're going to eat it.'- Albert Ballin, 
President of the Hamburg-Amerika Line and the informal go-between with 
London, was no more sympathetic. A friend of Bethmann's predecessor as 
Chancellor, he called Bethmann 'Billow's revenge', and talked of his 'torpor', 
his 'passivity', his 'lack of initiative', his 'enormous ineptitude'. 'Bethmann', he 
said, 'was an uncommonly articulate man ... who did not realise that politics is a 
dirty business.'- Von Biilow, the former Chancellor, pointed to what he 
considered the fatal flaw: 'It would have been quite enough to have told Vienna 
[after Sarajevo] that we definitely refused our authorisation of any breach 


between Serbia and Austria-Hungary.'- 

In England, the criticisms of Bethmann were merciless. Popular sources 
recounted not only his 'half-heartedness' and 'indecision' but also his 
'essentially Prussian conceptions of political morality'. It was generally believed 
that Bethmann conducted German foreign policy unaware that the wheel of state 
was really in the hands of the military.- After the war, Bethmann was to make a 
strong point of collective guilt. 'All nations are guilty,' he insisted in his 
Memoirs. 'Germany, too, bears a large part of the blame.'- 

Bethmann's road to war began in the first week of July. Owing to the Foreign 
Minister's absence on honeymoon, Bethmann took personal charge of German 
diplomacy from the start. He constantly protested his determination to avoid an 
international conflict. On the morning of 5 July he was summoned by the Kaiser 
to advise on Austria's request for assistance in its quarrel with Serbia. Two 
contradictory decisions were taken-one to refrain from a direct response, and 
the other to assure Francis-Joseph that Germany would not desert him. In the 
afternoon he attended a meeting of the Kaiser's military advisers, where the 
opinion prevailed that Russia would not intervene and that Serbia should be 
punished, 'the sooner the better'. This encouraged Bethmann to tell the Austro- 
Hungarian Ambassador: 

Vienna has to judge what has to be done to clarify Austria's relations with Serbia. [None the less], in this 
undertaking it can count safely on Germany's support of the Monarchy as an ally and a friend-whatever 

1 1 O 

the decision.- 


Here was the notorious 'blank cheque' for Austria's war against Serbia. 

Back at Hohenfinow on the evening of the 8th, Bethmann talked to Riezler 
'on the verandah under a starry sky'. He explained the dangers of a general 
conflict. He then said that inaction was the worst policy of all. He was obsessed 
by fears of Russia: 'The future belongs to Russia, which grows and grows, 
looming above us as an increasingly terrifying nightmare.'- At bottom, 
therefore, the Chancellor agreed with those more outspoken generals who said 
that Germany's position could only suffer from delay. Six days later, on the 14th, 
though nothing special had happened, Riezler reports the Chancellor as saying, 
'Our position is desperate ... This action is a leap in the dark and as such a most 
serious duty.' It would seem that Bethmann had already resigned himself to 'the 
calculated risk' of a Continental war.- 

In the third week of July Bethmann began to suspect that his gamble was ill- 


conceived. None of the requisite pieces of the puzzle was falling into place. He 
advised the Kaiser to prolong his Baltic cruise in order to maintain a show of 
normalcy. When his advice was refused he tendered his resignation, and his 
resignation was refused as well. According to Riezler, the Chancellor was in 
fatalist mood, and was sensing that public opinion favoured war-'an immense 
if undirecteddrive for action in the people'.- With this in mind he took two 
practical steps. He stopped the Minister of Interior from arresting the assorted 
socialists, Poles, and others on its list of Reichsfeinde or 'unreliable elements'; 
and in a secret meeting with the Social Democrat leader he informed the 
Opposition of the gravity of the situation. Both these steps had the effect of 
disarming popular opposition to the war. 

On the 29th, when Russia responded to Austria's attack on Belgrade with 
partial mobilization, Bethmann at last paid serious attention to the possibility of 
a general conflict. He proposed a neutrality agreement to Great Britain, 
guaranteeing the integrity of France's metropolitan territory. In the night, 
contrary to his previous line, he bombarded Vienna with 'World on Fire' 
telegrams advising mediation. Neither produced any effect. As a result, Germany 
was facing war with Russia without having secured Austrian support. Berlin was 
committed to help Vienna, but Vienna might not help Berlin. The Alliance was 
in total disarray. 

The moment of decision was reached on 30 July. The Kaiser took fright from 
the telegrams coming out of St Petersburg. In the margin of one of them he 
scrawled a note about 'the war of extermination against us'.- Berlin was 
convinced of its 'encirclement'. At 9 p.m. Bethmann met with the military 
leaders, von Moltke and von Falkenhayn. They took the decision to declare 'a 
state of imminent war', thus automatically starting the countdown to the 
outbreak of a general Continental war in the first days of August. And they did 
so without any knowledge of Russia's full mobilization or of Belgian and British 
intentions. From that point on, barring retractions, the die was cast. 

In the two key decisions of 5 July and 30 July, there is little evidence to 
suggest that the generals forced through a warlike line contrary to Bethmann's 
advice. It is true that in the last resort the Kaiser possessed the traditional 
Prussian Kommandogewalt or 'power of command' over both generals and 
ministers. But the Chancellor never put himself in a position where it might have 
been used against him. He did not stumble into war; he was party to the 
decisions which provoked it.- The one thing to say in mitigation, and often 


ignored by Allied historians, is that Russia had mobilized with the same rashness 
as Germany. 

Henceforth, for the Chancellor, the main consideration was to pin the blame 
on the Entente. At 11 p.m. on the 30th he learned that Russia's general 
mobilization was in train, and used the information to justify his prior decision 
taken in the dark. On the 1st Bethmann declared war on Russia, whilst 
demanding impossible assurances from Paris that France should abandon the 
Franco-Russian alliance. Ballin was privy to the scene in the garden-room of the 
Kanzlerspalais, where Bethmann was frantically driving the clerks to complete 
the drafting of the declaration. 'Why such haste to declare war on Russia, Your 
Excellency?' he asked. 'If we don't, we shan't get the socialists to fight.'- On 
the 2nd the German Ambassador in Brussels was ordered to take a letter from a 
sealed envelope, prepared seven days before by von Moltke. The letter 
demanded that Belgium accept German protection against a (non-existent) 
French attack. On the 3rd, Germany declared war on France. 

On the afternoon of 3 August, at the same time that Grey was addressing the 
Commons, Bethmann addressed the Reichstag with his speech about the Russian 
'firebrand'. 'A war with Russia and France has been forced upon us,' he 
declared. Echoing Grey's words about determination and resolution, Bethmann 
said: 'The entire German nation ... is united to the last man.'- 

On the 4th, German troops invaded Belgium. In mid-afternoon Bethmann 
heard from the Wilhelmstrasse that the British ultimatum had arrived. In his 
Speech from the Throne, the Kaiser spoke calmly of 'drawing the sword with a 
clear conscience and clean hands'.- But Bethmann was livid. When the British 
Ambassador called to take his leave, the walls of the Kanzlerspalais reverberated 
to the strains of an unprecedented tirade of recriminations. Shouting in French, 
the Chancellor harangued the Ambassador for a good twenty minutes: 

This war is only turning into an unlimited world catastrophe through England's participation. It was in 
London's hands to curb French revanchism and pan-Slav chauvinism. Whitehall has not done so, but rather 
repeatedly egged them on ... All my attempts [for peace] have been wrested from me. And by whom? By 
England. And why? For Belgian neutrality. Can this neutrality, which we violate from necessity, fighting for 
our very existence, really provide the reason for a world war?... Compared to the disaster of such a 
holocaust, does not this neutrality dwindle into a scrap of paper? Germany, the Emperor and the 
Government are peaceloving. The Ambassador knows that as well as I do. We enter the war with a clear 
conscience. But England's responsibility is monumental.- 

The Ambassador broke into tears. Diplomacy had come to an end. 


Oddly enough, Bethmann's phrase about the 'scrap of paper '-un chiffon de 
papier -does not appear in the Ambassador's original summary of the tirade. 
Like Grey's words about 'the lamps going out', there must be some doubt 
whether it was uttered at that fateful meeting.- 


The emotions of those summer days found their best expression in places often 
far removed from the haunts of diplomats. 

In Paris, on 3 August Marcel Proust drove to the Gare de l'Est with his 
brother, a medical officer en route for Verdun, then returned to the Boulevard 
Haussmann after midnight to write to his agent. 'Millions of men are going to be 
massacred in a War of the Worlds, like that of Wells.'- 

In England, Virginia Woolf was spending the Bank Holiday at Rodmell, near 
Lewes in Sussex. At 4 p.m. on the 3rd she wrote to Vanessa Bell. 'Dearest, 
Would it be possible for you to let us have half the rent-£15-before we go 
away?... The postman brought rumours that two of our warships are sunk- 
however, we found ... that peace still exists ... I do adore Thee.'- 

The young poet Rupert Brooke, who had dined the previous week at 10 
Downing Street with the Asquiths and Churchill, dashed off a letter to Gwen 
Darwin, now Mrs Raverat: 


Everything's just the wrong way round. I want Germany to smash Russia to fragments, and then France to 
break Germany. Instead of which I'm afraid Germany will badly smash France, and then be wiped out by 
Russia. France and England are the only countries that ought to have any power. Prussia is a devil. And 
Russia means the end of Europe and any decency. I suppose the future is a Slav Empire, world-wide, 
despotic and insane.- 

D. H. Lawrence was on holiday with three friends in the Lake District: 

I had been walking in Westmoreland, rather happy, with water-lilies twisted round my hat ... and I pranked 
in the rain, [whilst] Kotilianski groaned Elebrew music -Ranani Sadekim Badanoi... Then we came down 
to Barrow-in-Furness, and saw that war was declared. And we all went mad. I can remember soldiers 
kissing on Barrow station, and a woman shouting defiantly to her sweetheart: 'When you get at 'em, Clem, 
let 'em have it'... - and in all the tram-cars 'War-Messrs Vickers Maxim call in their workmen'... 

Then I went down the coast for a few miles. And I think of the amazing 
sunsets over flat sands and a smoky sea ... and the amazing vivid, visionary 
beauty of everything heightened up by immense pain .. .- 


In Germany and Austria the excitement ran equally high. Thomas Mann was 
at Bad Tolz in Bavaria, wondering when the Landsturm would call. Declining to 


act as witness at his brother Heinrich's wedding, he recorded his current 
feelings: 

Shouldn't we be grateful for the totally unexpected chance to experience such mighty events? My chief 
feeling is a tremendous curiosity-and, I admit it, the deepest sympathy for this execrated, indecipherable, 
fateful Germany, which, if she has not hitherto unqualifiedly held 'civilisation' as the greatest good, is at 
any rate preparing to smash the most despicable police state in the world.-' 

In Vienna, rumours were rife that the Papal Nuncio had been refused access 
to the Emperor. Pius X was said to be heartbroken by his failure to preserve the 
peace. (He died on 20 August.) Vatican documents later showed the rumours to 
have been false: the Papal Secretary of State approved of imperial policy. 

Vienna was in aggressive mood. The Chief of Staff, General von 
Hoetzendorff, had asked his German counterpart six months earlier, 'Why are 
we waiting?' He was now doubly incensed by the delays. Even the sceptical 
Hungarian Prime Minister, Count Tisza, had been won over. 'My dear friend,' he 
told the Belgian ambassador on 31 July, 'Germany is invincible.'- 

The poet Stefan Zweig, who would later condemn the war, was moved by the 
crowds of patriotic demonstrators. He had just cut short a seaside holiday at Le 
Coq, near Ostend, and had arrived home on the last Orient Express to run. 'You 
may hang me from a lamp-post', he had told a Belgian friend, 'if ever the 
Germans march into Belgium.' He had then watched German military trains 
rolling to the frontier at Herbesthal: 

As never before, thousands and hundreds of thousands felt what they should have felt in peacetime, that 
they belonged together, [acknowledging] the unknown power which had lifted them out of their everyday 

1 ftf) 

existence.- 

Zweig was fearing service on the Eastern Front. 'My great ambition... is to 
conquer in France,' he confessed, 'the France that one must chastise because one 
loves her.' He would soon print a public farewell to friends in the enemy camp: 
'I shall not try to moderate this [widespread] hatred against you, which I do not 
feel myself, [but which] brings forth victories and heroic strength.'- 

On 3 August, as Zweig arrived at Vienna's Westbahnhof, Lev Davidovich 
Bronshtein-Trotsky-departed. He had seen the same demonstrations, had seen 
the confusion of his socialist colleagues in the offices of the Arbeiterzeitung , and 
had been warned about internment. He immediately took train to Zurich, where 
he began to pen The War and the International -a work where he mobilized 
famous phrases such as 'the self-determination of the nations' and 'the United 
States of Europe' for his vision of a socialist future.- 


Lenin, in contrast, lay low in his refuge at Poronin, near Zakopane in Galicia, 
confident that the opposition of the German Social Democrats would prevent a 
major conflict. When he heard that his German comrades had voted for war 
credits, he was reported to exclaim, Trom today I shall cease being a socialist 
and shall become a communist.'- In nearby Cracow, the university year had 
just finished. Graduating students, many of them reserve officers, were leaving 
to join their regiments-some to fight for the Emperor-King, some for the 
Kaiser, and some for the Tsar. 

In St Petersburg, the court of Nicholas II was coming to terms with the 
fateful decisions of previous days. The Tsar had ordered full mobilization on 
Thursday 17/30 July, apparently without consulting the Minister of War. The 
resultant German ultimatum had been left unanswered. St Petersburg heard of 
Germany's declaration of war on the Saturday, and had followed suit on the 
Sunday. Monday 21 July/3 August, therefore, was the first full day at war. At 7 
p.m. military censorship came into force. The newspapers announced that 'the 
nation must accept the paucity of information released, content in the knowledge 
that this sacrifice is dictated by military necessity'.- That day, the Tsar visited 
Moscow, and gave a speech in the Great Palace of the Kremlin. Their Imperial 
Majesties went to pray in the chapel of Our Lady of Iveron, an icon which 
celebrated Russia's earliest religious links with Mt Athos. 

The optimists in Russia put their faith in the Bol'shaya Voennaya 
Programmas the 'Great Military Programme', which had been launched early in 
1914 and which aimed, among other things, to cut the imperial army's 
mobilization time to eighteen days. As the British military attache reported, their 
hope was that 'the Russians would be in Berlin before the Germans were in 
Paris.' The pessimists, headed by Pyotr Durnovo, the Minister of the Interior and 
Director of Police, felt a strong sense of foreboding. Durnovo had reported to the 
Tsar in February that if the war went badly 'a social revolution in its most 
extreme form will be unavoidable'.- 

At Vevey in Switzerland, Romain Rolland, musicologist, novelist, and star of 
the international literary set, watched aghast as his friends succumbed to war 
fever. Furious at the stance of the Vatican, he claimed that Europe had lost all 
moral guidance since the death of Tolstoy, whose biography he had just written: 

3-4 August I'm devastated. I would like to be dead. It is horrible to live in the middle of this demented 
humanity, and to be present, but powerless, at the collapse of civilization. This European War is the greatest 
catastrophe in history, for centuries. [It's] the ruin of our holiest hopes for human brotherhood I'm almost 


alone in Europe.- 


The outbreak of war in 1914 provoked more ponderings on the subject of 
historical causation than any other modern event. Many people were led to 
believe that a catastrophe of such titanic proportions must have been determined 
by causes of a similarly titanic scale. Few imagined that individuals alone were 
to blame. Huge works were written about the war's 'profound causes'. Indeed, 
historians were still arguing these issues out when a second world war gave them 
even more food for thought. 

The word 'titanic' is not irrelevant. Shortly before the First World War, 
Europe had been shocked by a huge maritime disaster which all the experts had 
said could not happen. On 15 April 1912 the largest steamship in the world, the 
White Star liner SS Titanic of 43,500 tons, struck an Atlantic iceberg on her 
maiden voyage and sank with the loss of 1,513 lives. Given the vessel's size, it 
was obvious that an accident would have unprecedented consequences. On the 
other hand, there was no reason to relate the causes of the disaster to its scale. 
Two committees of inquiry pointed to very specific features of the particular ship 
and the particular voyage. These included the design of the hull, the provision of 
lifeboats, the unusual state of the Arctic ice, the excessive speed, the northerly 
course set by Capt. Smith, and the lack of co-ordinated action during the one and 
three-quarter hours following the initial collision with the iceberg. Historians of 
shipwrecks clearly have to inquire why the Titanic sank, but also why so many 
other huge ships have been able to cross the Atlantic in perfect safety.- 

The analogy with wars is not entirely out of place. Historians of wars have to 
enquire not only why peace failed in 1914, but also why it held in 1908 or in 
1912 and in 1913. The more recent experience of the 'Cold War' has shown, 
despite the potential for colossal disaster, that armageddon does not necessarily 
flow from the dynamic of two rival military and political blocs. 

No one did more to provoke discussion of these issues than the wiseacre of 
Magdalen College, A. J. P. Taylor. For the generations involved, war history had 
been heavily coloured by emotions and moral overtones fired by the death of 
millions; and it took a man of monumental irreverence to challenge conventional 
attitudes. Addressing the events of 1914, Taylor named the persons who 
appeared to have caused the war single-handed: 'The three men who made the 
decisions, even if they, too, were the victims of circumstances, were Berchtold 
[the Austrian Foreign Minister], Bethmann Hollweg, and the dead man, 


Schlieffen.' As an incurable germanophobe, he said nothing about Sir Edward 
Grey.- 

In another brilliant essay on the military logistics of 1914, Taylor approached 
an extreme position where the very notion of causation seemed redundant: Tt is 
the fashion nowadays to seek profound causes for great events. But perhaps the 
war that broke out in 1914 had no profound causes... In July 1914, things went 
wrong. The only safe explanation is that things happen because they happen.'- 

Elsewhere, he reverted to the more convincing standpoint, which explains 
the great catastrophes of history in terms of a fatal combination of general and 
specific causes. The 'profound causes', on which other historians had laid such 
stress, were shown to be an essential element both of the pre-war peace and of 
the breakdown of peace. Without the 'specific causes', they were of little 
consequence: 

The very things which are blamed for the war of 1914-secret diplomacy, the Balance of Power, the great 
continental armies-also gave Europe a period of unparalleled peace ... It's no good asking 'What factors 
caused the outbreak of war?'. The question is rather 'Why did the factors that had long preserved the peace 
of Europe fail to do so in 1914?'- 

In other words, there had to be a spark to ignite the keg of gunpowder. Without 
the spark, the gunpowder remains inert. Without the open keg, the sparks are 
harmless. 

To illustrate the point, Taylor might well have chosen the case of the Titanic. 
Instead, he chose the analogy not of ships but of motor cars. By so doing, he 
emphasized the dynamic element common to most variants of catastrophe 
theory, where events are seen to be moving inexorably towards the critical point: 

Wars are much like road accidents. They have a general and a particular cause at the same time. Every road 
accident is caused in the last resort by the invention of the internal combustion engine... [But] the police 
and the courts do not weigh profound causes. They seek a specific cause for each accident-driver's error, 
excessive speed, drunkenness, faulty brakes, bad road surface. So it is with wars.- 

-The Kaiser's comment was wrongly translated and widely publicized in 
Britain as 'a small, contemptible army'-hence the chosen nickname of the 
British Expeditionary Force, 'The Old Contemptibles'. 

* 'Modernism' is usually reserved for cultural as opposed to socio-economic 
trends. In the 19th c. it was used as a pejorative term by Catholic conservatives 
(see p. 797), but was later employed as a catch-all label for all avant-garde 
artistic movements (see p. 854).

TENEBRAE 

Europe in Eclipse, 1914-1945 


There are shades of barbarism in twentieth-century Europe which would once 
have amazed the most barbarous of barbarians. At a time when the instruments 
of constructive change had outstripped anything previously known, Europeans 
acquiesced in a string of conflicts which destroyed more human beings than all 
past convulsions put together. The two World Wars of 1914-18 and 1939-45, in 
particular, were destructive beyond measure; and they spread right across the 
globe. But their main focus lay unquestionably in Europe. What is more, in the 
course of those two war-bloodied generations, the two most populous countries 
of Europe fell into the hands of murderous political regimes whose internal 
hatreds killed even more tens of millions than their wars did. A rare voice of 
conscience said early on that something vile was happening: 

Why is this age worse than earlier ages? In a stupor of grief 
and dread have we not fingered the foulest wounds and left 
them unhealed by our hands? 

In the west, the fading light still glows and the clustered 
housetops glitter in the sun, but here Death is already 
chalking the doors with crosses, and calling the ravens, and 
the ravens are flying in.- 




Future historians, therefore, must surely look back on the three decades 
between August 1914 and May 1945 as the era when Europe took leave of its 
senses. The totalitarian horrors of communism and fascism, when added to the 
horrors of total war, created an unequalled sum of death, misery, and 
degradation. When choosing the symbols which might best represent the human 
experience of those years, one can hardly choose anything other than the agents 
of twentieth-century death: the tank, the bomber, and the gas canister: the 
trenches, the tombs of unknown soldiers, the death camps, and the mass graves. 

Consideration of these horrors, which overshadow all the life-giving 
achievements of the era, prompts a number of general remarks. In the course of 
the horrors, Europeans threw away their position of world leadership: Europe 
was eclipsed through European folly. In 1914 Europe's power and prestige were 
unrivalled: Europeans led the field in almost any sphere one cared to mention- 
science, culture, economics, fashion. Through their colonial empires and trading 
companies, European powers dominated the globe. By 1945 almost all had been 
lost: the Europeans had fought each other to the point of utter exhaustion. 
European political power was greatly diminished; Europe's military and 
economic power was overtaken; European colonial power was no longer 
sustainable. European culture lost its confidence; European prestige, and moral 
standing, all but evaporated. With one notable exception, every single European 
state that entered the fray in 1914 was destined to suffer military defeat and 
political annihilation by 1945. The one country to avoid total disaster was only 
able to survive by surrendering its political and financial independence. When 
the wartime dust finally settled, the European ruins were controlled by two 
extra-European powers, the USA and the USSR, neither of which had even been 
present at the start. 




Map 24. 

Europe during the Great War, 1914-1918 

On the moral front, one has to note the extreme contrast between the material 
advancement of European civilization and the terrible regression in political and 
intellectual values. Militarism, fascism, and communism found their adherents 
not only in the manipulated masses of the most afflicted nations but amongst 
Europe's most educated elites and in its most democratic countries. Such was the 
distortion of worthy ideals that there was no shortage of intelligent men and 
women who felt compelled to fight 'the War to end War', to join the fascists' 
genocidal crusade for rescuing 'European civilization', or to excuse the 
communists' pursuit of peace and progress through mass murder. When the 
moment of truth arrived in 1941, Allied leaders fighting for freedom and 
democracy did not hesitate to enlist one criminal in order to defeat another. 

On the historiographical front, one has to take account of the fact that the 
European horrors were committed within the span of living memory, and that 
subjective, political, and partisan opinions continue to dominate popular 





accounts. The history of all great conflicts always tends to be rewritten by the 
victors, who maximize the crimes and follies of the vanquished whilst 
minimizing their own. Such, after all, is human nature. In both World Wars, it so 
happened that victory was achieved by similar coalitions headed by the 'Western 
powers' and by their strategic ally in the East; and it is their version of the period 
which continues to dominate post-war education, media, and history books. This 
'Allied version' was first given official credence after 1918, when 
representatives of the defeated nations were obliged to confess to their own 
exclusive war guilt. It was cemented after 1945, when an Allied tribunal applied 
itself exclusively to the war crimes of the enemy. Any public attempt to judge 
the Allied Powers by the same means or standards was politically impossible. 
Official war museums from Lambeth to Moscow and Washington continued to 
present a one-sided view of the evils and the heroism. The captured archives of 
the losers were fully accessible in all their gmesome detail; key archives on the 
winning side remained firmly closed. Fifty years on, it was still too early for a 
fair and objective balance sheet to be drawn up. 

On the interpretational front, many years passed before some historians 
began to ponder the unity of the 'European civil war'. People who lived through 
the two World Wars were often impressed by the discontinuities. The 'soldiers' 
war' of 1914-18 was thought to be very different from the 'people's war' of 
1939-45. Anyone involved in the feud between communism and fascism was 
encouraged to think of the two movements as simple opposites. Now, with the 
benefit of hindsight, it is increasingly clear that the successive conflicts formed 
part of one dynamic process: the two World Wars were separate acts of the same 
drama. Above all, the main contestants of the Second World War were created 
by the unfinished business of the First. By entering into military conflict in 1914, 
the European states unleashed the mayhem from which were born not one but 
two revolutionary movements-one of which was crushed in 1945, the other left 
to crumble in the dramatic events of 1989-91 (see Chapter XII). 

Faced by German expansionism, and then by the twin hydras of communism 
and fascism, the democratic Western Powers could only survive by calling in the 
USA-first in 1917-18 and then in 1941-5. After 1945 they relied very largely 
on American muscle to withstand the challenge of a bloated Soviet empire. Only 
in the 1990s, with Germany reunited and the Soviet empire in a state of collapse, 
could the people of Europe resume the natural course of their development so 
mdely interrupted in that beautiful summer of 1914. 



In this scenario, therefore, the years between 1914 and 1945 appear as the 
time of Europe's troubles, which filled the space between the long peace of the 
late nineteenth century and the still longer peace of the 'Cold War'. They may be 
likened to the slipping of a continental plate, and to the resultant season of 
earthquakes. They encompass the initial military quakes of 1914-18, the 
collapse of four empires, the outbreak of communist revolution in Russia, the 
emergence of a dozen new sovereign states, the armed truce of the inter-war 
decades, the fascist take-overs in Italy, Germany, and Spain, and then the second, 
general military conflagration of 1939-45. 

At the heart of the troubles lay Germany, Europe's newest, most dynamic, 
and most disgruntled nation-state. The fault-line of the earthquake zone ran 
along Germany's eastern border. Germany harboured few designs against 
Western Europe. But in Eastern Europe she faced both the temptation of 
relatively weak and poor neighbours and, in Russia, the challenge of the only 
European country large enough to contest German military strength. Hence, 
from the start, the major duel over Europe's future lay between Germany and 
Russia. It was a duel which in the hands of totalitarian revolutionaries was 
destined to become a fight to the death. From the start, the Western democracies 
were cast in the role of spoilers, essentially uninterested in the fate of east 
Europeans, but determined to stop the growth of any overweening Continental 
power which might eventually turn against the West. This constellation of forces 
governed European politics for the rest of the twentieth century. It underlay the 
fighting of the two World Wars and, but for the invention of nuclear weapons 
and the involvement of the Americans, would probably have produced a third. 

In the event, the era of open and general conflict was somehow confined to 
those 30 blood-soaked years. It began and ended, quite appropriately, in the 
German capital, Berlin. It began on 1 August 1914, in the imperial Chancellery, 
with the Kaiser's declaration of war on Russia. It ended on 8 May 1945, in the 
Soviet field HQ at Berlin-Karlshorst, where a third act of capitulation finally 
concluded Germany's acts of unconditional surrender.

The First World War in Europe, 1914-1921 



The Great War, which began in August 1914, was widely expected to last for 
three or four months. It was going to be over by Christmas. Conventional 
wisdom held that modern warfare would be more intense than in the past, but 
more decisive. Whichever side could gain the upper hand in the early stages 
would have the means for a swift victory. In the event, the fighting lasted not for 
four months but for more than four years. Even then it was not decisive: the 
'Great Triangle' of military-political power blocs was not resolved until 1945, 
and in some respects not until 1991. (See Appendix III, p. 1312.) 

In their initial configuration, the geopolitical structures of the Great Triangle 
were somewhat tentative. The Western Allies (Britain and France) were severely 
handicapped by the fact that France alone possessed a large standing army. They 
had to pass two precarious years before their full potential could be realized. 
They held on, first, by tempting Italy to join the Allied camp in May 1915; 
secondly, by the steady military build-up in Britain and the British Empire; and 
thirdly, by the entry of the USA in April 1917. Britain's Asian associate, Japan, 
which declared war on Germany on 23 August 1914, did not play any part in the 
European conflict. The Allies' main partner, imperial Russia, was thought to be 
handicapped by clumsy mobilization procedures, by a vast network of internal 
communication, by doubts over its industrial capacity, and by divided counsels 
over strategic aims. Yet Russia mounted an early offensive. She eventually 
collapsed, not through lack of shells or soldiers, but through political and moral 
decay.- 

The Central Powers (Germany and Austria-Hungary) could benefit from all 
the advantages of consolidated policy and interior lines of communication. They 
lost one associate through Italy's desertion, but gained an unexpectedly resilient 
ally in the Ottoman Empire, which was obliged to take sides in November 1914 
from fear of Russia. In 1914 they were terrified by the prospect of a war on two 
fronts. They need not have worried: they were to prove themselves capable of 
sustaining major campaigns in eight theatres of operations-on the Western 
Front, in Belgium and France; on the Eastern Front, against Russia; in the 
Balkans; in the Levant; in the Caucasus; in Italy; in the colonies; and at sea. 

The war aims of the combatants had not been articulated by the outbreak. 
The Central Powers started the war with defensive and deterrent purposes in 
mind. They aimed to prevent Austria being undermined, to break the 
encirclement of Germany, as they saw it, and to forestall French and Russian 
claims. Yet they were quick to formulate a catalogue of demands. They planned 


to transfer the eastern provinces of Belgium (Liege and Antwerp) to Germany, 
and parts of Serbia and Romania to Austria; to increase the German colonial 
collection, in order to undermine the British and the Russian Empires; and to 
establish political and economic hegemony over 'Mitteleuropa', including 
Poland. Only the Ottomans aimed merely to survive. 

The Entente Powers took up arms because they were attacked, hence their 
incurable sense of moral superiority. Yet Serbia hoped to drive the Austrians 
from Bosnia, France aimed to recover Alsace-Lorraine, Britain was soon looking 
for colonial and financial compensation, and Russia harboured extensive plans 
for aggrandizement. In September 1914 the Russian General Staff published a 
'Map of the Future Europe' which was remarkably similar to the one which was 
realized in 1945.^ In addition Russia extracted a secret promise from its allies for 
post-war control of the Straits. Italy aimed to gain the irredenta. 

Several countries contrived to stay neutral. Spain, Switzerland, the 
Netherlands, and the three Scandinavian countries maintained their neutrality 
throughout, and prospered from it. Bulgaria was pulled into the war in 
September 1915, Romania in August 1916, Greece in June 1917. China, despite 
Japan's seizure of the Chinese enclaves leased to Germany, attacked by Japan, 
entered the war on the Allied side in 1917. Others were less reluctant to fight. 
Several hundred members of Pilsudski's Polish Legion opened up the Eastern 
Front by marching across the Russian frontier near Cracow on 6 August 1914. 
They were carrying cavalry saddles in the hope of finding mounts. They aimed 
to demonstrate that Poland was still alive after a century and more of Partition. 
They wisely retreated when Cossacks approached, and were incorporated into 
the Austrian army. 

Military strategy and tactics, as always, were based on the lessons of recent 
wars. The Franco-Prussian War and the Boer War had proved the vulnerability of 
infantry attack. The solution was thought to lie in three areas-in the use of 
massed artillery as the primary offensive arm against battlefield positions, in the 
use of railways for the rapid deployment of attacking forces, and in the use of 
cavalry for encirclement and pursuit. On the Eastern Front these assumptions did 
not prove ineffective. But in the West, where fortified trench-lines came into 
being, it took thousands of abortive operations before the superiority of the 
concrete blockhouse over the high-explosive shell was even suspected. Despite 
the manifest advantages of defence over attack, the generals were slow to revise 
their assumptions. Aircraft, whose engines were weak and unreliable, could only 


be used for reconnaissance, artillery guidance, and aerial combat. In the majority 
of locations, where there were few metalled roads, horsepower remained 
indispensable. At sea, submarine torpedoes proved more lethal than the 15-inch 
guns of the Dreadnoughts. 

On the Western Front, the German army very nearly pulled off a shock 
assault before the war of attrition set in. Whilst the central German thrust 
plunged into the heart of Champagne, the German right wing rode off on a huge 
wheeling arc through northern France. Aiming to repeat the triumph of 1870, 
they moved on Paris from three directions. They were briefly held by the 
Belgians at Liege, and by the British Expeditionary Force at Ypres. 
[langemarck] The central German forces were delayed by the cellars of 
Epernay. But by the first week of September 1914 the French capital was facing 
disaster. At the very last moment, General Joffre impressed 600 Renault taxis to 
ferry all available French reserves to the line of the Marne. The German centre 
had just too little momentum; the German right was just too far away. So the line 
fell back. In October and November the Front stabilized along the whole length 
of a double trench-line running from Switzerland to the Channel (see Map 24). 

For the next three years the line hardly moved. Both sides expended men and 
materials in titanic proportions to straighten out the occasional salient, or to 
achieve a breakthrough. But every 'push' was to no avail. Never had European 
blood been spilled in such profligate quantities. In the three battles of Ypres, at 
Vimy Ridge, on the Somme, and, above all, at Verdun the loss of life could on 
occasion be counted in tens of thousands per hour or hundreds per square yard. 
Here was a mindless tragedy which no one had foreseen, and which no one knew 
how to stop. The planned German retreat to prepared defensive positions 
between Arras and Soissons in February 1917 was a rare act of rationality. 
Inevitably, the public finger was pointed at the impotent generals. Of the British 
army, it was said, 'They were lions led by donkeys.' [douaumont] 

On the Eastern Front, which ran through the heart of Poland, the Central 
Powers enjoyed much greater success and the hell of unbroken trench warfare 
was avoided. In August 1914 two Russian army groups crossed the frontier, one 
entering East Prussia in the north, the other penetrating deep into Galicia in the 
south. Seeing that the 'Russian steamroller' was meant to move slowly, this was 
a considerable achievement. But then fortunes changed: in the Battle of the 
Masurian Lakes in September, Hindenberg and Ludendorff totally destroyed 
Russia's northern armies, thereby avenging the German failure on the Marne. 



Russia's southern group was halted on the outskirts of Cracow. In the winter of 
1914-15 indecisive battles were fought both on the German/Russian frontier 
near Lodz and on the Hungarian border in the Carpathians. But then in May 
1915, at Gorlice in Galicia, German troops managed to do what proved 
impossible in the West: they broke through enemy lines, and fanned out into the 
plain beyond. In August they occupied Warsaw, and retook Lvov. In the autumn 
they entered Lithuania, and were poised to cross the mountains into Romania, 
[petrograd] 

With the Russian Empire facing invasion along a 1,000-mile front, the Tsar 
took personal command of his forces in the field. In January 1916, Brusilov's 
counter-offensive drove back deep into Galicia, laying an 18-month siege to the 
fortress of Przemysl. But the toll was tremendous; and there it ended. In 
Romania, the Germans took Bucharest in December. In 1917 the main German 
and Austrian advance restarted, moving steadily into the Baltic provinces, 
Byelorussia, and Ukraine. With internal revolution compounding Russia's 
military failure, it was a matter of fine judgement whether the Central Powers 
could destroy the Empire of the Tsars before it collapsed of its own accord. It is 
often said that the Russian army suffered excessive casualties; in reality the 
Russians lost a lower percentage of their population than other combatants. The 
key statistics refer to prisoners of war. For every 100 tsarist soldiers who fell in 
battle, 300 surrendered. The comparable figure for the British army was 20, for 
the French 24, for the Germans 26. The soldiers of the Tsar had little will to 
fight.- 


LANGEMARCK 

Langemarck is a small village five miles to the north of Ypres in Belgium. 
Like all the villages in that district, it possesses a war cemetery filled with 
the dead from successive Anglo-German battles over the Ypres salient in 
1914-17. In outward appearance it is indistinguishable from scores of others. 
Indeed, the long-overgrown grave of 25,000 unidentified German soldiers 
bears no comparison to the imposing monument at the nearby Menin Gate, 
where the names of 40,000 unidentified British casualties are inscribed. Yet, 
in the opinion of a leading military historian, Tt is, in a real sense, the 





birthplace of the Second World War.' 1 For, unbeknown to many modern 
visitors, Langemarck shelters the last resting-place of the comrades of a 
young Austrian volunteer whom Providence spared for still greater deeds. 

Hitler, an unsuccessful art student and draft-dodger from the Austrian 
army, had listened with rapture in a Munich crowd to the declaration of war 
on 1 August 1914, and had immediately signed up for service in the German 
Army. He was assigned to the 16th Bavarian Reserve Infantry (List) 
Regiment, and arrived on the Western Front in October, just in time for the 
first Battle of Ypres. In this way he became a witness to the terrible 
Kindermord, the 'Massacre of Innocents', where tens of thousands of half- 
trained German recruits, mainly eager university students, were cut to pieces 
by the steady firepower of professional British soldiers. It was the first great 
slaughter of Germans, amply revenged, no doubt, at Passchendaele and on 
the Somme. Hitler never forgot it. 

Hitler's 'supreme experience' in the trenches, where for four years he 
lived the charmed life of a courageous Meldeganger or 'regimental runner', 
undoubtedly fired the pathological drive of his subsequent career. Tormented 
by the fate of his dead and mutilated comrades, and by a huge German 
sacrifice that led only to defeat, he set out to avenge their deaths; to 
humiliate Germany's conquerors in their turn; and to make Germans feel 
once again proud, superior, hateful, ruthless. His vow of vengeance struck a 
common chord in millions of wounded German hearts. 

Langemarck, therefore, symbolizes the essential psychological link 
between the First World War and the Second, between the slaughter of Ypres 
and Verdun, and that of the London Blitz, Warsaw, and Stalingrad. 


DOUAUMONT 

On 25 February 1916, on the fourth day of the German offensive against 
Verdun, the troops of the Crown Prince seized the stone and concrete fortress 
of Douaumont. The fort lay 6 km from their starting-point on the 
circumference of the salient, and half-way to the centre of the city. For the 
next eighteen months it would be the focal point of a battle which in duration 




and intensity has no equal. Flanked to the west by the Fort de Vaux, it 
commanded the right bank of the Meuse and looked across to the hills of the 
left bank, especially to Cote 304 and to Le Mort-Homme. For the German 
attackers, it formed the pivot of a giant pincer operation fed by fourteen 
railway lines along a 130-mile arc. For the French defenders, it formed the 
terminus of the voz'e sacree, the narrow corridor which brought 
reinforcements through the evacuated city from Bar-le-Duc. Shelled night 
and day, mined from below, and constantly rocked by explosions, its ruins 
and tunnels were the scene of hand-to-hand combat and of whole companies 
buried alive. The moonscape was steadily churned into a cold stew of mud, 
masonry, and human remains. It was regained by the French on 24 October, 
contested by the Germans until August 1917, but not definitively relieved 
until the American offensive of St Michel in September 1918. Petain's words 
proved true. 'Courage,' he had promised; 'On les aura.' 

Verdun claimed some 800,000 lives-forty times the population of the 
city. It is for the French memory what the Somme and Ypres were for the 
British and Caporetto for the Italians, or what Stalingrad would be for the 
Russians. For the Germans, it implied what all their military failures would 
do-titanic, futile sacrifices. 

On the seventieth anniversary of the battle in 1986, the French President and 
the German Chancellor participated at Verdun in a ceremony of 
reconciliation. Their hands were linked in a gesture which few other leaders 
of Europe's warring nations have been able to achieve. 

By then, much of the devastated landscape had been reclaimed by 
vegetation. But the vast ossuary at Douaumont, with its tower of four 
crosses, guards the remains of 130,000 unidentified soldiers of both armies 
who rest in the common granite tombs. A memorial centre, equipped with 
exhibits, guidebooks, and video shows, attempts to communicate what a 
veteran once called the 'incommunicable'. On the site of the disappeared 
village of Fleury-devant-Douaumont, a Madonna adorns the facade of a 
memorial chapel. She is Notre Dame de I'Europe. 1 



PETROGRAD 


In 1914 the name of Russia's capital, Sankt Petersburg, was changed to I the 
more patriotic-sounding Petrograd. As with the British royal family of 
Hanover-Saxe-Coburg, which was changed to Windsor, a name of German 
origin was thought inappropriate during the war against Germany. But 
Petrograd was to last for only one decade before it gave way in its turn to 
Leningrad, [gotha] 

St Petersburg had grown into one of Europe's most magnificent cities. In 
addition to the classical palaces and government buildings, the banks of the 
Neva housed a major port and commercial centre, a brilliant cultural 
community, an expanding industrial district, and a huge garrison. The spirit 
of the community of two million citizens was captured in the statue of the 
Bronze Horseman presented to the city by Catherine the Great in honour of 
her predecessor, Peter. 

At the time of the first name-change, the city's future dedicatee was 
exiled in Switzerland with no hope of an early return. He was no pacifist; 
and his statement on The Tasks of Revolutionary Social Democracy, where 
he called for an 'international civil war' to exploit the conflict, envisaged the 
defeat of Tsardom. All his leading supporters in Russia were arrested on 
suspicion of treason. At their trial they were defended by a liberal lawyer, 
Alexander Kerensky, who must later have rued his choice of clients. 1 

Under Soviet rule, Petrograd/Leningrad was to be subjected to the most 
extreme of experiences. Spurned by the Bolsheviks, who had moved the 
capital to Moscow, it was repeatedly seen by Stalin as the conspiratorial nest 
of a non-existent opposition; it lost a significant part of its population first in 
the Revolution and again in the Purges. In 1941-4, it endured a 1,000-day 
siege on the edge of the German-Soviet frontline, and in conditions of 
indescribable cold, hunger, and starvation lost up to a million inhabitants. 2 
Although state officials and the military secured the means to fight on for 
three years, the Soviet authorities either could not or would not evacuate or 
supply the civilian population. The result was a daily mix of Coventry and 
the Warsaw Ghetto. Descriptions of carousing in the Party House, alongside 
corpses in the streets and scientific workers dead at their laboratory benches, 



only add to the tally of inhumanity. 3 

After each ordeal Leningrad was replenished by a fresh influx of 
immigrants. The 'Hero City' became a symbol of the human capacity for 
regeneration. Yet in 1991, on the eve of the Soviet collapse, the question of 
its name arose for the third time. To the horror of Communist veterans, the 
citizens' referendum decided neither for Leningrad nor for Petrograd but for 
Sankt Petersburg. 


Meanwhile, in the Balkan theatre, superior Austrian forces steadily gained 
the upper hand. They occupied Belgrade (October 1915), Montenegro, and 
Albania (1916). A heroic Serbian retreat across the mountains to the Dalmatian 
coast provided the stuff of legend. In 1915 the Serbs were corralled into 
Macedonia, where Bulgaria joined the Austrian attack. But the Macedonian 
Front held, partly through French support via Thessalonika. Merciless Western 
pressure on Greece forced the collapse of the government, and ended Greek 
neutrality, [flora] 

In the Mediterranean, the Western Powers enjoyed naval supremacy, and 
several attempts were made to compensate for the stalemate in France. On 25 
April 1915 a British force landed at Gallipoli on the Dardanelles. The aim was to 
seize Constantinople, to establish direct contact with Russia, and, in the words of 
the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, to attack 'the soft underbelly' 
of the Central Powers. The plan was brilliantly conceived, but ended in tragedy. 
The movements of the expeditionary force, which contained the heroic Anzac 
Division from Australia and New Zealand, had been betrayed in advance. The 
Turks were waiting on the cliff-tops, commanded by an energetic young officer 
called Kemal Pasha. After that, the Western Powers confined their activities to 
the Ottoman periphery. A young English visionary, T. E. Lawrence, single- 
handedly led the tribes of the Arabian peninsula into revolt. The French 
established themselves in Lebanon. In 1916 General Allenby advanced into 
Palestine from the British base in Egypt, riding into Jerusalem on Christmas 
Day. The British also entered Mesopotamia. They captured Baghdad after a 
humiliating reverse in March 1917, and pressed on into Persia. Both Arabs and 
Zionist Jews took heart from the British victories. On 2 November 1917 the 
British Foreign Minister, Arthur Balfour, was persuaded to issue a declaration 
accepting the principle of a Jewish National Home in Palestine. In the Caucasus, 




Russians and Ottomans struggled back and forth over the mountainous 
Armenian border region. The fighting provided the backdrop to the Ottoman 
Government's reprisals against its Armenian subjects, [genocide] 

In Italy, battle was joined with the Austrians in difficult alpine terrain on the 
edge of the lands which the Italians were claiming as their own. In eleven 
colossal battles on the River Isonzo, the fighting was no less sacrificial than in 
the West. Half a million men died at Caporetto (September-December 1917). 
Italy's casualties were on the same scale as Britain's. Her magnificent recovery 
from the brink of disaster greatly weakened the Central powers. The Austrian 
army was broken in Italy. The Italian sacrifice, largely discounted by her allies, 
left a deep sense of wounded pride. 


FLORA 

Late in August 1914, the 35-year-old daughter of a Suffolk clergyman, 
Flora Sandes, arrived with seven companions in the Serbian town of 
Kragujevac. Some fifty miles from Belgrade, Kragujevac was the main base 
for Serbian forces fighting for their capital city against the Austro-Hungarian 
offensive. Flora's group preceded several British, French, Russian, and 
American medical teams appointed by the Serbian Relief Fund. In mid-April 
1915 they were joined by Mrs Mabel St Clair Stobart, a formidable dame 
who had raised a Women's Sick and Wounded Convoy Corps during the 
recent Balkan wars. She now came up from Salonica, in command of a 70- 
strong field hospital staffed entirely by women, except for her husband, John 
Greenhaigh, their treasurer. She collected her casualties with a special 
'flying column', which she led on horseback. Over 600 British female 
volunteers were active in Serbia. 

Of all the women's wartime organizations, the British women's medical 
services were undoubtedly among the most professional. Known as the 
Scottish Women's Hospitals (SWH), after their founder, an Edinburgh 
surgeon called Elsie Inglis, they set out to prove that women could cope with 
the most stressful and responsible of enterprises. In due course they sent 
fourteen fully equipped hospitals to all the Allied fronts except those 
controlled by the British army. Mrs St Clair Stobart had worked in 




Cherbourg and in Antwerp before sailing for Serbia. Dr Inglis died in 
November 1917 after a year in Russia. 1 Female surgeons were still a novelty 
in those years, especially in military hospitals. A French journalist, who once 
asked to watch Dr Inglis at work, emerged looking green and yelling: 'C'est 
vrai, elle coupe' (It's true, she's cutting!) 2 

In October 1915, when the Austrians and Bulgarians broke through, the 
Serbian army could escape only by a winter trek over the mountains to the 
Albanian coast. That terrible march through mud, snow, hunger, frostbite, 
typhus, and gangrene cost 40,000 lives. The Stobart Unit marched with 
them. 

Of all the volunteers, Flora Sandes (1879-1961) went furthest in her 
career of gender inversion. She joined the Serbian infantry, survived the trek 
to Albania, fought in combat, was severely wounded, and was decorated for 
bravery. She ended the war with an officer's commission. She later married a 
Russian emigre, settled in Belgrade, defied the Gestapo, and only returned to 
England in widowhood. 3 She was following a well-worn East European 
tradition, observable from Russia and Poland to Albania, where women in 
hard times stand in for their decimated menfolk. 

One source for the British women's determination lay in the attitudes of 
their own government. When Elsie Inglis offered the services of the SWH to 
the War Office in August 1914, she was told: 'My good lady, go home and 
sit still.' 4 


In the colonies, every outpost of the combatant powers felt bound to uphold 
the cause of the mother country. There was a remote campaign between the 
French and the German Cameroons. The British seized German East Africa 
(Tanganyika) and German South-West Africa. In this unequal contest the weaker 
German party generally proved the more resourceful. The German force in East 
Africa under General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck (1870-1964) survived intact 
until the Armistice. 

At sea, the war ought in theory to have produced a series of almighty 
contests between the bristling fleets of battleships. In practice, the French fleet 
betook itself to the Mediterranean, whilst the German fleet, after one 
inconclusive engagement with the Royal Navy off Jutland (31 May 1916), 




betook itself to port. The British, who could nominally claim command of the 
seas, could not cope with German submarines operating from Kiel and 
Bremerhaven which sank over 12 million tons of Allied shipping. The British 
blockade, which practised unrestricted submarine warfare in the North Sea, 
contributed to serious food shortages in Germany. But Britain also faced acute 
deprivation. The sinking of the civilian liner Lusitania by submarine U20 on 7 
May 1915, and Germany's subsequent extension of unrestricted submarine 
warfare into the Atlantic (1917), were instrumental in ending American 
neutrality. 


GENOCIDE 

On 27 May 1915, the Ottoman Government decreed that the Armenian 
population of eastern Anatolia should be forcibly deported. The Armenians, 
who were Christians, were suspected of sympathizing with the Russian 
enemy on the Caucasian Front, and of planning a united Armenia under 
Russian protection. Some two to three million people were affected. Though 
accounts differ, one-third of them are thought to have been massacred; one- 
third to have perished during deportation; and one-third to have survived. 
The episode is often taken to be the first modern instance of mass genocide. 
At the Treaty of Sevres (1920), the Allied Powers recognized united 
Armenia as a sovereign republic. In practice, they allowed the country to be 
partitioned between Soviet Russia and Turkey. 1 

Adolf Hitler was well aware of the Armenian precedent. When he 
briefed his generals at Obersalzburg on the eve of the invasion of Poland, he 
revealed his plans for the Polish nation: 

Genghis Khan had millions of women and men killed by his own will 
and with a gay heart. History sees him only as a great state-builder... I have 
sent my Death's Head units to the East with the order to kill without mercy 
men, women, and children of the Polish race or language. Only in such a 
way will we win the lebensraum that we need. Who, after all, speaks today 
of the annihilation of the Armenians? 2 

The term 'genocide', however, was not used before 1944, when it was 
coined by a Polish lawyer of Jewish origin, Rafal Lemkin (1901-59), who 




was working in the USA. Lemkin's campaign to draw practical conclusions 
from the fate of Poland and of Poland's Jews was crowned in 1948 by the 
United Nation's 'Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of 
Genocide'. 3 Unfortunately, as the wars in ex-Yugoslavia have shown, the 
Convention in itself can neither prevent nor punish genocide. 


In the third year of war the strains began to be reflected in politics. In 
Dublin, the Irish Easter Rising (1916) had to be suppressed by force. In London, 
regular party government was overturned by the formation of Lloyd George's 
coalition War Cabinet (December 1916). At that same time, in Austria-Hungary 
the death of Lrancis-Joseph struck a note of deep foreboding. The first wartime 
meeting of the Reichsrat (May 1917) broke up amidst Czech demands for 
autonomy and rumours of a separate peace. In Prance, an epidemic of mutiny 
provoked a prolonged crisis that was eventually brought under control by the 
combined efforts of the new commander, Marshal Petain, and the new Premier, 
Georges Clemenceau. In Germany the Kaiser's Easter message in 1917 proposed 
democratic reforms; and in July all parties of the Reichstag who had voted for 
war credits in 1914 now voted for a peace of reconciliation. On the Eastern 
Front, after the failure of moves for a separate peace with Russia, the Central 
Powers restored a puppet Kingdom of Poland in Warsaw. The kingdom had no 
king, and a regency council with no regent. It had no connection with the Polish 
provinces in Prussia, in Austria, or east of the Bug. Its formation was soon 
followed by the dissolution of Pileudski's Polish Legions, who refused to swear 
allegiance to the German Kaiser. In Russia, there was revolution. In the USA, 
there was war fever, [coward] [lili] 

Austria's young Friedenskaiser (Peace Emperor) personally led one of 
several sets of secret negotiations with the Allied Powers. In the spring of 1917, 
in Switzerland, he twice met with his brother-in-law, Prince Sixtus of Bourbon- 
Parma, a serving Belgian officer, who acted as the go-between with Paris and 
London. He was ready to make territorial concessions to Italy, and accepted 
French claims to Alsace-Lorraine. But he did not convince either the Italians or 
the French of his ability to influence Berlin, and was forced to grovel before the 
German Emperor when Clemenceau eventually made the contacts public. From 
that point on, the fate of the Habsburg monarchy was tied to the military fortunes 
of Germany; and all hope for the peaceful evolution of the nationalities in 




Austria-Hungary was dashed.- 

The entry into the war of the USA, which occurred on 6 April 1917, came 
after many American attempts to promote peace. The 28th President, Thomas 
Woodrow Wilson (1856-1924), an East Coast liberal and a Princeton professor, 
had been re-elected in November 1916 on the neutrality ticket; and his envoy, 
Colonel House, had visited all the European capitals. As late as January 1917 
Wilson's State of the Union speech was calling for 'peace without victory'. But 
America's maritime economy was mortally threatened by German submarines; 
and Germany's clumsy scheme to recruit Mexico, as revealed in the Zimmerman 
Telegram of February 1917, finally removed all doubts. Wilson's idealism 
openly confronted the secret diplomacy of the British and French. His Fourteen 
Points (January 1918) lent coherence and credibility to Allied war aims. He was 
strongly attached to the principle of national self-determination, equitably 
applied. Thanks to the musical soirees given at the White House by Ignacy 
Paderewski, he put Polish independence on the agenda. 


COWARD 

At 6 a.m. on 18 October 1916, at Carnoy on the Western Front, Private 
Harry Farr of the West Yorkshire Regiment was shot dead by a British firing 
squad. A volunteer with six years' service, not a conscript, he had twice been 
withdrawn from the front line suffering from shell-shock. On the third 
occasion he had been refused treatment at a medical station, since he had no 
wounds, and, after resisting the sergeant escorting him to the trenches, was 
arrested. He repeatedly said, 'I cannot stand it'. At the court martial, the 
general commanding XIV Corps said that the charge of cowardice seemed 
'clearly proved'. This was confirmed by Commander-in-Chief Douglas 
Haig. 

In due course Farr's widow, Gertrude, received a letter from the War 
Office: 'Dear madam, We regret to inform you that your husband has died. 
He was sentenced for cowardice and was shot at dawn on 16 October.' She 
received neither a war widow's pension nor an allowance for her daughter. 
But she did receive a message via her local vicar, from the regimental 
chaplain: 'Tell his wife he was no coward. A finer soldier never lived.' She 





lived to be 99 and to read the papers of the court martial, which were not 
released by Britain's Public Record Office until 1992. 

Private Farr was one of 3,080 British soldiers sentenced to death by court 
martial in 1914-18, mainly for desertion, and one of 307 who were not 
reprieved. In rejecting the plea of mercy in a similar case, Douglas Haig 
minuted: 'How can we ever win if this plea is allowed?' 1 

In the Second World War, some 100,000 British soldiers deserted, but 
none was shot. Recaptured deserters from the Red Army or from the 
Wehrmacht were not so lucky. 2 


Taken together, however, the changes of 1917 aroused great anxiety in the 
Allied camp. For the time being, the entry of the USA was more than offset by 
the chaos in Russia. The Entente was gaining a partner with great potential 
whilst losing its most powerful partner in the field. Twelve months would pass 
before the weight of American manpower and industrial production could be 
felt. In the mean time, as Russian resistance declined, the Central Powers could 
transfer an increasing share of their resources from East to West. The outcome of 
war was seen to depend on a race for time between the effects of mobilization in 
the USA and the effects of revolution in Russia. 


LILI 

Some time in 1915, somewhere on the Eastern Front in the middle of 
Poland, a young German sentry was dreaming of home. Hans Leip imagined 
that two of his girlfriends, Lili and Marlene, were standing with him under 
the lamp by the barrack gate. He whistled a tune to cheer himself up, 
invented a few sentimental lines, then promptly forgot them. Twenty years 
later, in Berlin, he remembered the tune, and added some verses, merging the 
two girls' names into one. Set to music by Norbert Schultz, it was published 
in 1937. Inter-war Berlin was one of the great centres of cabaret and popular 
songs. But The Song of a Lonely Sentry met no success. 1 

In 1941, when the German Army occupied Yugoslavia, the powerful 





transmitter of Radio Belgrade was requisitioned by the military. Amongst its 
stock of second-hand disks was a pre-war recording of Hans Leip's song. By 
chance, Belgrade's nightly music programme could be heard beyond the 
Balkans in North Africa, both by Rommel's men and by the 'desert rats' of 
the British Eighth Army. This time, the voice of Lale Andersen, floating on 
the ether under the starlit Mediterranean sky, bewitched the listening 
soldiers. The words were soon translated into English, and recorded by Anne 
Shelton. After the siege of Tobruk, when a column of British prisoners 
passed through the lines of the Afrika-Korps, both sides were singing the 
same tune: 


1. Uli Marlccn 



Vor der Kaserne, vor dem grossen Tor 
Stand eine Lateme, und steht sie noch davor. 

So wolln wir uns da wiedersehen, bei der Laterne 
wolln wir stehn Wieeinst Lili Marleen. 


Underneath the lantern by the barrack gate 
Darling, I remember, how you used to wait. 

'Twas there you whispered tenderly, That you lov'd 
me; you'd always be, My Lili of the lamplight, My 
own Lili Marlene. 


When the USA joined the war, Lili Marlene was taken up by Marlene 
Dietrich. It was to cross all frontiers. 2 


Les Feuilles mortes was composed in the wartime Paris of 1943, where Lili 
Marlene was on everyone's lips. Its bitter-sweet words were written by 
Jacques Prevert, its haunting melody by Joseph Kosma. Its theme of 
separated lovers might again have matched the mood of millions. But the 
Jean Gabin film for which it had been commissioned was cancelled; and the 
song was never issued. By the time it was rediscovered after the war, the 
social and political climate had changed; and the English words had lost the 
original flavour: 












C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble 
Toi tu m'aimais, et je t'aimais. 

Nous vivions tous les deux ensemble 
Toi qui m'aimais, moi qui t'aimais. 
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment, 
Tout doucement, sans faire de bmit. 

Et la mer efface sur le sable 
Les pas des amants desunis. 


The falling leaves drift by the window 
The autumn leaves of red and gold. 

I see your lips, the summer kisses, 

The sun-burned hands I used to hold. 
Since you went away, the days grow long, 
And soon I'll hear old winter's song. 

But I miss you most of all, my darling, 
When autumn leaves start to fall. 


Where were the waves on the seashore, and the lovers' footprints lost in the 
sand? But in the 1950s Autumn Leaves was unstoppable. 3 

In the post-war era, popular songs headed the tide of American culture- 
good, bad, indifferent-which was to sweep over Europe. The transatlantic 
sound of Anglo-American songs was destined for dominance. But it is well 
to remember that in many parts of Europe, in Naples, in Warsaw, in Paris, 
and in Moscow, the native idioms preserved their excellence:

The Russian Revolution of 1917 consisted of several interwoven chains of 
collapse. The two political eruptions-the February Revolution which 
overturned the tsarist monarchy and the second, October Revolution or coup 
which installed the Bolshevik dictatorship-were attended by upheavals 
reaching to the very depths of the Empire's social, economic, and cultural 
foundations. They were also accompanied by an avalanche of national risings in 
each of the non-Russian countries which had been incorporated into the Empire, 
and which now took the chance to seize their independence. 

The effects on the prosecution of the War were dramatic. In mid-February 
1917 the last of the Romanovs still stood at the head of Europe's largest war- 
machine. Within twelve months the Romanovs had been extinguished; their 
Empire had disintegrated into a score of self-ruling states; and the Bolshevik 
rulers of the central rump territory had pulled out of the war for good. Following 
an armistice agreed at Brest-Litovsk, all effective Russian participation in the 
war ceased from 6 December 1917. German policy, which had been supporting 
both the aspirations of the separatists and the machinations of the Bolsheviks, 
scored a triumph of unparalleled proportions. 

The disintegration of the Russian Empire must be seen not simply as one of 
the effects of the Revolution but also as one of its causes. The Russian Tsar had 
been losing the allegiance of his non-Russian subjects long before the 
appearance of the Bolshevik dictatorship definitively confirmed their desire for a 
separate existence. When the Polish provinces were lost due to the German 
advance in 1915, the Empire's leading Polish politician, Roman Dmowski, 
turned his back on Russia once and for all. Henceforth he was to work for Polish 
independence under the auspices of the Western Powers. A Polish National 
Committee was set up under his chairmanship in Paris in August 1916. In 
Lithuania, the Taryba or National Council was set up under German auspices in 
September 1917. In Finland, an independent republic had to fight for its 
existence, with German help, from mid-1917 to May 1918. In Ukraine, the 
national movement came to the fore as soon as imperial power weakened. A 
Ukrainian Republic was formed in Kiev in November 1917. By the so-called 




'Bread Treaty' of 9 February 1918, it was able to gain recognition from the 
Central Powers in return for grain contracts. In the Caucasus, the independent 
Transcaucasian Federation came into being at the same time. 

Faced with this spontaneous wave of separatism, successive Russian 
governments in Petrograd had little choice but to bow before the storm. The 
Provisional Government declared itself to be in favour of the independence of 
the nationalities in April 1917. The Bolsheviks and others followed suit. In 
reality, despite the rhetoric, the Bolsheviks had no intention of conceding 
independence to the nationalities. As soon as they seized power in Petrograd, the 
chief Bolshevik commissar for the nationalities, an obscure Georgian 
revolutionary known as J. V. Stalin, began organizing branches of the Bolshevik 
Party in each of the emerging republics, fomenting trouble against each of the 
fledgeling national governments. Bolshevik policy aimed to restore the defunct 
Russian Empire in new communist guise. From the start, they sought to impose a 
centralized Party dictatorship behind a facade of cultural autonomy and nominal 
state structures. Here lay one of the principal sources of the so-called 'Russian 
Civil War' (see below). 

The Revolution in Petrograd, therefore, was addressed to the central 
government of a state that was already in an advanced state of decomposition. 
The immediate cause lay in a crisis of management in the tsarist court. The Tsar 
himself was absent at the front, floundering in his ill-judged determination to 
conduct the war in person. The Duma was ignored; and the Tsar's ministers were 
left at the mercy of a paranoiac 'German' Tsarina and her mountebank confidant, 
the so-called 'mad monk', Gregory Rasputin (1872-1916). When urgent wartime 
business regarding inflation, food shortages, and army supply was neglected, 
members of the innermost tsarist circle rebelled. Rasputin was murdered by 
Oxford-educated Prince Felix Yusupov, son of the richest woman in Russia and 
husband of the Tsar's niece. In other circumstances, the event might have gone 
down in history as a petty court intrigue. As it was, it added the last ounce of 
accumulated resentment that broke the stays of the entire system. For beyond the 
confines of court politics lay tens of millions of the Tsar's voiceless subjects- 
disaffected intellectuals, frustrated constitutionalists, confused bureaucrats, 
workers without rights, peasants without land, soldiers without hope either for 
life or for victory. The glittering shell of tsarism stayed upright till the last 
second, then fell like a house of cards. 

The chain of events which led from Rasputin's murder on 17 December 1916 



to the Bolsheviks' seizure of power ten months later was extremely tortuous and 
entirely unplanned. In late February the arctic winter, which had contributed to a 
breakdown of food supplies, changed suddenly to premature spring sunshine. 
Thousands of strikers and demonstrators poured on to the streets of Petrograd 
calling for peace, bread, land, and freedom. On 26 February, on Znamensky 
Square, a company of the Imperial Guard fired the first fatal volley. The next day 
160,000 peasant conscripts of the capital's garrison mutinied and joined the 
rioters. The Tsar's generals prevaricated. The Duma dared to appoint a 
Provisional Government without him, whilst representatives of various socialist 
factions convened the Petrograd Soviet or 'Council of Workers' and Soldiers' 
Deputies'. 

In this way there arose the dvoyevlas'tye or 'Dual Power', where the Duma 
had to compete with the Petrograd Soviet. Each side took momentous decisions. 
On 1 March the Soviet issued its unilateral Order No. 1, which called on every 
military unit to elect a soviet of its own. At a stroke, the authority of the officer 
corps was ruined throughout the Army. On 2 March the Provisional Government 
issued an 8-point programme calling for the installation of elected officials in 
local government and for the replacement of the state police by a people's 
militia. At a stroke, the authority of the police and of local officialdom was 
undermined throughout Russia. The Russian Empire fell apart 'by telegraph'. 
That night, Nicholas II abdicated. 

For a time an uneasy alliance between the constitutional liberals within the 
Duma and the moderate socialists within the Soviet-mainly Mensheviks and 
Socialist Revolutionaries (SR), both opposed to the Bolsheviks-kept the Dual 
Power on an even keel. Here the central figure was Alexander Kerensky (1881- 
1970), a socialist and a lawyer, who was a member both of the Provisional 
Government and of the Soviet. But their policy of continuing the war was highly 
unpopular. They only succeeded in stoking the climate of ceaseless discontent 
which was to prove so favourable to more radical elements. The Provisional 
Government declared its intention of calling universal elections for a Constituent 
Assembly, which could then put Russian democracy on to a permanent footing. 
This gave the Bolsheviks their timetable: to stand any chance of ruling Russia, 
they had to take control of the soviets and overthrow the Provisional 
Government before the Constituent Assembly could meet, [fatima] 

Prior to Lenin's return to Petrograd in April, the Bolsheviks played only a 
minor role in the revolutionary events. But a deteriorating situation in the spring 



and summer created a fertile environment for disciplined subversives. On three 
occasions, in April, in June, and in July, they tried to exploit their growing 
influence in the Petrograd garrison, seeking to transform street demonstrations 
into armed insurrections. On the last occasion, the Provisional Government 
actually ordered the Bolshevik leaders' arrest on charges of high treason, having 
learned of their German contacts. Lenin was forced to take refuge in the 
countryside. In August and September, however, the Government was paralysed 
by its conflict with the army under General Lavr Kornilov. Kornilov's abortive 
putsch gave Lenin the respite to plan a coup of his own. 

When Lenin slipped back into Petrograd early in October, Kerensky's 
government was isolated and thoroughly discredited. The army was disaffected; 
the soviets were divided. Bolshevik plans aimed to neutralize the main Petrograd 
Soviet by calling a parallel Congress of Soviets crammed with Bolshevik 
delegates from the provinces. Simultaneously the Soviet's key Military- 
Revolutionary Committee, now under Bolshevik control, was briefed to supply 
the necessary soldiers, sailors, and armed workers, for purposes which the Soviet 
itself had not approved. Trotsky took command, [sovkino] 


FATIMA 

On 3 May 1917, at the height of the First World War, Pope Benedict XV 
appealed to the Blessed Virgin Mary for a sign in the cause of peace. Ten 
days later, three illiterate children reported a vision of Our Lady outside the 
village of Fatima in Portugal. They heard her say that she was The Lady of 
the Rosary', that the advent of Antichrist was at hand, and that a chapel of 
prayer should be built on the site. Some time afterwards one of the children, 
Lucia dos Santos, revealed that the Virgin's prophecy had referred to Russia: 

'I shall come to ask for the consecration of Russia to my Immaculate 
Heart. If my requests are heard, Russia will be converted, and there will be 
peace. If not, she will spread her errors through the entire world, provoking 
wars and persecution of the Church ... But in the end, my Immaculate Heart 
will triumph.' 1 


The Marian cult was often associated with anti-Communism, especially 




during the Spanish Civil War. In 1942 Pius XI initiated the Feast of the 
Immaculate Heart of Mary. On 13 May 1981 Pope John Paul II, who played 
a prominent personal role in the downfall of Communism, was struck down 
by a would-be assassin's bullet in Rome. He prayed to Our Lady of the 
Rosary, recovered, and joined the pilgrimage to Fatima. 2 

Practising Christians must still wrestle with the mysteries of prophecy. 
Visions of the Virgin, first recorded with that of Elizabeth of Schonau 
(1164), have persisted throughout modern times. They include La Salette 
(1846), Lourdes (1854), Pontmain (1871), Knock in Mayo (1879), Banneux 
in Belgium (1933), and Medjugorje in Bosnia (1981). The apparitions at 
Medjugorje, near Mostar, which continued to attract thousands, were not 
authenticated by the Catholic hierarchy. They were all the more disturbing 
for seemingly having occurred on the site of wartime massacres, 
foreshadowing the Bosnian horrors of 1992-3. 3 [bernadette] [madonna] 


On the night of 25 October the plan was activated. Bolshevik pickets 
surrounded all government buildings. There was no reaction. On the morning of 
the 26th, at 10 a.m., Lenin issued a press release: 

To the Citizens of Russia 

The Provisional Government has been deposed. Government authority has passed into the hands of the 
organ of the Petrograd Soviet... the Military-Revolutionary Committee, which stands at the head of the 
Petrograd proletariat and garrison. The task for which the people have been struggling has been assured- 
the immediate offer of a democratic peace, the abolition of the landed property of the landlords, worker 
control over production, and the creation of a Soviet Government. Long live the Revolution of Workers, 
Soldiers and Peasants!- 


SOVKINO 

On 24 October 1917 the cinemas of St Petersburg were showing The Silent 
Ornaments of Life-a psychological drama centring on the complex relations 
of a Prince Obolensky with the gentle Claudia and the scheming Nelly. The 
very next day power was seized by the Bolsheviks. They had a very 








different, and very definite, view of cinematic art. 'Of all the arts,' wrote 
Lenin, 'for us the cinema is the most important.' Cinema was an instrument 
not to entertain but to propagandize the masses. In 1919, therefore, Lenin 
signed a decree transferring the photographic and cinematographic industry 
to the People's Commissariat for Education. In due course a 'Society of 
Friends of the Soviet Cinema' was founded by none other than Felix 
Dzierzhynski, head of the political police. 1 

Russian cinema had made its debut shortly after silent movies were 
launched by Louis Lumiere in the Grand Cafe in Paris on 28 December 
1895. There were Russian film directors, Russian newsreels, Russian film 
studios, and Russian film stars, such as the super-cool Vera Kholodnaya. The 
first Russian feature film was an historical drama, Drankov's Sten 'ka Razin 
(1908). After the February Revolution 1917 there was a brief flutter of 
sensational films about contemporary politics, such as Grisha Rasputin's 
Amorous Escapades. Under the Bolsheviks, all such frivolity was to cease. 

The Bolsheviks made no secret of their plans for turning cinema into an 
arm of the Party. In order to do so, they first had to destroy the existing 
institutions. In Kino-Fot (1922), the poet Mayakovsky wrote lines as if by 
order of the agitprop department: 

For you, a cinema spectacle 
For me, almost a Weltanschauung ! 

The cinema-purveyor of movement 
The cinema-renewer of literature 
The cinema-destroyer of aesthetics 
The cinema-fearlessness 
The cinema-a sportsman 
The cinema-a sower of ideas. 

But the cinema is sick. Capitalism has covered its eyes 
with gold ... 

Communism must rescue the cinema from speculators. 2 

After years of chaos, the State Cinema Board, Sovkino, did not really begin 
to operate until the mid 1920s. Even then, it was not the expected success 
until subordinated to thoroughgoing Stalinist planning in the 1930s. 

Much of Soviet cinema history was taken up either by socialist realism 
or by the heroics of the Second World War. But there were shafts of light 



amidst the gloom-one of them connected with the brilliant productions of 
The Thaw' in the 1960s, when Bondarchuk's War and Peace or Kalatozov's 
The Cranes are Flying were released, others with directors of genius, 
notably Eisenstein. 

Sergei Eisenstein (1898-1948), son of the chief architect of Riga, 
belonged to that part of gilded Tsarist youth who threw in their lot with the 
Bolsheviks. Apart from his technical brilliance, he had a clear idea of his 
objectives, the most important of which was to convey the irresistible tide of 
history. He completed only six films; in every one, the human collective is to 
the fore. 

In his first film, Strike (1925), Eisenstein portrayed the passion of a 
workforce as it awakes to its own sense of power. He also caricatured the 
bosses in the manner of 'Krokodil'. In Battleship Potemkin (1926), which 
embellished a true incident from the 1905 Revolution, he concentrated on 
the emotions of the ship's crew and the oppressions of the common people. 
The tableau of the Odessa Steps, where a regiment of Cossacks slaughter 
innocent protesters, must be one of the most famous set-pieces in cinema 
history. In October (1927) he celebrated the tenth anniversary of the 
Bolshevik coup, once again by highlighting the role of the masses in such 
inspiring (but imaginary) scenes as the storming of the Winter Palace (see p. 
920). In Old and New (1929) he examined the communal life of the 
peasantry. 

When Eisenstein returned to Russia after several years abroad, he 
addressed more distant history. His Alexander Nevsky (1938) was a 
prophetic study of the coming conflict with Germany. The tableau of the 
medieval battle on the ice, where grotesque Teutonic Knights drown en 
masse from the weight of their own armour, was an uncanny allegory of 
Stalingrad, five years before the event. To have directed a film of Ivan the 
Terrible (1945) while Stalin was still alive and watching-he was an eager 
movie buff-was a measure of Eisenstein's unrivalled standing. 

Eisenstein's films prove that great art is not incompatible with overt 
propaganda. Indeed, as with religious art, when the message is unambiguous, 
the audience can concentrate on the skill by which it is being conveyed. At 
the Brussels Film Festival of 1958, Battleship Potemkin was voted No. 1 on 
the list of the world's twelve best films, [potemkin] 



Practically every word in the declaration was false or misleading. But it made no 
difference. As Lenin and Trotsky had correctly calculated, there was no one in 
the capital with the will to oppose them. The government ministers still huddled 
in the Winter Palace, waiting for a rescue that would never come. The imperial 
army was nowhere in sight. At 9 p.m. Bolshevik sailors on the cruiser Aurora 
fired one blank salvo at the Winter Palace. Some 30 shells were fired from the 
Peter and Paul Fortress, of which two found their target around 11 p.m. Most of 
the government guards just left; the mob moved in when they saw that no 
resistance was offered. The 'storming of the Winter Palace' was a later fiction. 
At 2.30 a.m. the Ministers surrendered. That was the moment when the 
Bolsheviks seized power in Petrograd. They did not intend to stop there. At a 
brief appearance that morning at the Congress of Soviets, Lenin hailed The 
worldwide socialist revolution'. It was nothing of the sort. It was not even a 
rising of the Petrograd socialists. In the original draft of the declaration of the 
26th, Lenin had ended with the slogan 'Long Live Socialism'. But he crossed it 
out. 

This is not to deny that Lenin and his Bolsheviks were revolutionaries of a 
most thoroughgoing kind. Once in power, they set about tearing up the old 
Russia root and branch. Under Lenin in 1917-21, and even more under Stalin 
from 1929 onwards, they reconstructed almost every aspect of Russian life. But 
they did it by coercion from above; and in defiance of Russia's mainstream 
radical and socialist movements. Their methods had little in common with the 
spontaneous revolution from below which filled their textbooks. 

Bolshevik actions in the immediate aftermath of the coup were summarized 
in the three famous 'decrees' which Lenin submitted to the Congress of Soviets 
in the evening of 26 October. None of them was quite what they purported to be. 
The Decree on Peace was, in effect, a private appeal to the Powers to accept a 
three-month armistice. The Decree on Land ordered the transfer of private 
landed property to the village communes. It had been lifted from the programme 
of the SRs, and was entirely inconsistent with the previous (and later) Bolshevik 
line, which supported the transfer of land to state ownership. The Decree on 
Government, which created the Sovnarkom or 'Council of People's 
Commissars', chaired by Lenin, was proclaimed subject to approval by the 
future Constituent Assembly. On each and every score, Lenin was indulging in 
sophistry. The international peace, which was realized by the December 
armistice and by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany on 3 March 1918, 
was used for launching all-out war on the Bolsheviks' opponents at home. The 



granting of land to the peasants was a well-timed tactic that calmed the rage of 
Russia's most numerous class at a critical moment. It would soon be followed by 
an all-out 'War on the Village', when the Bolsheviks enforced their state 
monopoly over prices and the food trade. 

The gesture to the Constituent Assembly was pure opportunism. The 
Bolsheviks let the country-wide elections for the Assembly proceed, as 
envisaged by the Provisional Government. The elections duly took place in the 
second half of November; and Bolshevik candidates polled 24 per cent of the 
vote. In this, the one and only free election in Soviet history, a clear victory went 
to the SRs, who took 40.4 per cent. But no such detail was going to deter Lenin. 
He allowed the Constituent Assembly to meet on 5 January 1918, then simply 
closed it down. Between 3 and 4 a.m. on the 6th, the Chairman of the Assembly 
and leader of the SRs, Victor Chernov (1873-1952), was trying to pass a law for 
the abolition of landed property when he was tapped on the shoulder by a sailor, 
the commander of the Bolshevik Guard. 'I have been instructed to inform you 
that all those present should leave the Assembly Hall,' the sailor announced, 
'because the guard is tired.'- From that point on, Russia was condemned to a 
conflict in which more Russians would die than on the Eastern Front (see 
Appendix III, p. 1320). 

The final year of the Great War, 1918, opened with the Central Powers planning 
a war-winning offensive, and ended with them in full retreat. The Eastern Front 
had been closed down; and the mountainous Italian Front was deadlocked. So 
everything turned on the Western Front. From March to July, the German 
command poured in their remaining reserves. They were not unsuccessful. On 
the British sector, they pushed forward some 35 miles south of Amiens. In the 
centre, they advanced once more to the Marne. But they broke neither the line 
nor the will of the Allies. In July, at the second Battle of the Marne, Petain's 
'elastic defence' showed that the attackers did not possess the critical mass of 
offensive superiority. Then, on 8 August, on 'the Black Friday of the German 
Army', 456 British tanks surged through the line, winning back 8 of the lost 35 
miles in one day. One week later, the German and Austrian emperors were told 
by their generals that the war must be ended. In September and October, in the 
eastern sector, American strength could at last make itself felt, first at Saint- 
Mihiel, where the largest salient of the Front was eliminated, and later in the 
Argonne. The German line never broke; the Germans did not feel defeated. But 


on 3 October they were sufficiently hard pressed to convey the offer of an 
armistice to President Wilson, [hatred] 

October 1918 was a remarkable month. The smell of peace did more to 
destroy the Central Powers than four years of fighting had done. The news from 
the minor fronts was bad. An Allied attack in Macedonia had succeeded, and 
Bulgaria had just collapsed. In Palestine, the British had finally achieved a 
competent battlefield victory at Megiddo near Mt Carmel; and the Ottomans 
were suing for peace. In Italy, after a last abortive push on the Piave, the Austro- 
Hungarian army had ceased to struggle. Everyone in Europe knew that the 
advantage lay with the Entente, that peace feelers were out, that further 
resistance would only prolong the agony. Whenever they could, the troops took 
matters into their own hands. The idle German and Austrian garrisons in the East 
were riddled with Soldaten-r'ate mimicking the Russian soviets. The Austrian 
army fell apart through the desertion of Czech, Polish, Croat, Hungarian, and 
indeed German regiments, who simply decided to go home. Everyone was 
claiming their national independence. On 20 October, when a German-Austrian 
assembly was convened in Vienna to prepare an Austrian Republic, the game 
was obviously up. The Emperor Charles, and 500 years of Habsburg rule, 
became irrelevant overnight Proclamations of independence were issued by 
several hitherto unknown states: Czechoslovakia (28 October), Yugoslavia (29 
October), Hungary (1 November), and, in Lemberg, the West Ukrainian 
Republic (1 November), [lyczakow] 


HATRED 

On 3 August 1918 the Archbishop of Canterbury, Randall Davidson, 
preached at St Margaret's, Westminster, before King and Queen, ministers, 
and both Houses of Parliament. Many in the congregation would have 
known that the Archbishop had repeatedly protested in private about the 
morality of the Government's wartime policy. Many must have been 
discomfited by what he now said in public. There is a form of wrath which 
may degenerate into a poisonous hatred running right counter to the 
principles of a Christian's creed,' he said in his soft Scot's voice. 'As 
pledged disciples of a living Lord and Master who died upon the Cross for 




all who hated Him, we have to see to it that the spirit of hate finds no nurture 
in our hearts.' 1 At his side, the Archbishop's chaplain and his later 
biographer, was Revd George Bell (1883-1958), the future Bishop of 
Chichester. Given the lead, the chaplain was to blossom into Protestant 
Europe's leading exponent of 'Christian Internationalism'. 2 

Bishop Bell was an unlikely internationalist. He spoke no word of a 
foreign language. But he possessed a firm command of Christian principles, 
and the courage to express them. In the post-war years he came under the 
close influence of Archbishop Nathan Soderblom of Uppsala, a Swedish 
Lutheran who had once been professor at Leipzig. In 1919 he attended the 
Wassenaar conference in Holland, which discussed war guilt; and in 1925, 
he helped organize the Stockholm conference on Christian 'Life and Work', 
which sowed the seed of the later World Council of Churches. 

In the early 1930s, as chairman of the Universal Christian Council for 
Life and Work (UCCLW), Bell was faced with the problem of German 
churches under pressure from the Nazis. In 1935 he insisted on a public 
resolution of protest; wrote a strong letter to Reichbishop Muller on behalf 
of the 'Confessing Church', and received an indignant von Ribbentrop in 
person at Chichester. Bell's meetings of the UCCLW at Novi Sad (1933) and 
Lano (1934) paved the way for the Oxford conference of 1937, which united 
several ecumenical groups and, recognizing the totalitarian challenge of both 
Nazism and Communism, saw the start of the Oxford Group for Moral 
Rearmament. 

As war loomed, Bishop Bell fearlessly spoke his mind. In June 1939, at 
Oxford University, he spoke on 'God above Nation', denouncing the 
'flagrant' insistence on state sovereignty and 'the havoc wrought by 
collective egoism'. 3 In November, he published 'The Church's Lunction in 
Wartime': 

The Church fails to be the Church if it forgets that its members in one nation 
have a fellowship with its members in every nation. [The Church] must... 
condemn the infliction of reprisals or the bombing by the military forces of 
its own nation. It should set itself against the propaganda of lies and hatred. 
It should be ready to encourage a resumption of friendly relations with the 
enemy nation. It should set its face against any war of extermination or 
enslavement, and any measures directly aimed at destroying the morale of a 



population ... 4 

These principles were not popular, not least with HM Government or 
with his diocesan congregation. But they were followed up by speeches in 
the House of Lords against the Internment of Aliens (August 1940), against 
'obliteration bombing' (9 February 1944), and against the use of the atomic 
bomb, [altmarkt] On the Allied Bombing Offensive, he used no 
euphemisms: 

It is no longer defence, military and industrial objectives which are the aim of the bombers. But the 
whole town ... is blotted out. How can there be discrimination in such matters when civilians, 
monuments, military and industrial objects all together form the target ? 5 

In July 1942 the Bishop undertook a dangerous flight to Stockholm to 
meet members of the Christian resistance from Germany. His appeal to the 
allied powers on their behalf was to be rejected. But it was to George Bell 
that Pastor Bonhoffer would smuggle out his last message from his death¬ 
cell in a Nazi prison. 'Tell him', it read, 'that... with him I believe in the 
principle of our universal Christian brotherhood, and that our victory is 
certain.' 6 

'Christian Europe' was always uppermost in Bell's thoughts on the 
future. Of the authors of the bombing offensive he had asked: 'Are they 
[alive] to the harvest they are laying up for the future relationships of the 
peoples of Europe?' In a post-war broadcast to Germany in 1945, he 
appealed to 'the spirit of Europe': 

Today, one of the principal goals ... should be the recovery of Christendom. We want to see Europe as 
Christendom ... No nation, no church, no individual is guiltless. Without repentance, and without 
forgiveness, there can be no regeneration . 7 

These ideas held the foreground in the early phase of the postwar European 
movement before it was hijacked by economists (see pp. 1064-6). George 
Bell played a proper and prominent part in the founding of the World 
Council of Churches, which took place in the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam 
on 22 August 1948-almost exactly thirty years after Archbishop 
Davidson's Westminster sermon. 



LYCZAKoW 


On 24 November 1918 three young people were buried in a special military 
sector of the Catholic cemetery at Lyczakow in the suburbs of Lwow 
(L'viv). Zygmunt Menzel, aged 23, Jozef Kurdyban, aged 19, and Felicja 
Sulimirska, aged 21, had all been killed in fighting between Poles and 
Ukrainians for the former capital of Austrian Galicia. It was the first of 
several thousand burials which brought the bodies of the Polish dead from 
temporary graves in parks and squares, and the starting-point for the 
'Cemetery of the Defenders of Lwow', the Campo Santo of the 'Young 
Eagles'. 1 The grave of the youngest would be that of Antos; Petrykiewicz, 
killed in action, aged 13. 

Like any of the great urban cemeteries of nineteenth-century Europe, 
Lyczakow was already a remarkable historical and artistic repository. Like 
Pere Lachaise in Paris or Highgate in London, its sylvan setting guarded the 
ornate mausolea of the families who had enlivened the growth of a major 
city. Two separate plots contained rows of simple crosses marking the graves 
of soldiers from the Polish risings of 1830 and 1863. 

The military cemetery at Lyczakow had its counterparts in hundreds of 
locations after the Great War, especially in Belgium and northern France. 
Constructed in 1919-34, in the period of Polish rule, it was dominated by an 
elevated arc de triomphe flanked by stone lions and a semicircular 
colonnade. The central arch was surmounted by the inscription mortui sunt 
ut uberi vivamus (they died so that we might live free); the lions held 
shields carrying the city's motto, semper fidelis (always faithful) and tobie 
polsko (To Thee, Poland). Behind the graves stood an arcaded crypt flanked 
by steps leading to a rotunda chapel. The ensemble was decorated by 
evergreen shrubbery and lit by bronze lampstands. Individual monuments 
were raised in memory of the Posnanian volunteers, the French infantry, and 
American pilots who lost their lives defending the city against the 
Bolsheviks in 1919-20. douaumont] [langemarck] 

If the origins of Lyczakow were unremarkable, its fate was not. In the 
years of Soviet annexation after 1945, the cemetery was vandalized and 
devastated. The crosses were uprooted, the inscriptions profaned, the 
monuments defaced, the chapel turned into a stonemason's workshop. 



Guarded by fierce dogs, the overgrown site could only be visited at the risk 
of arrest. Its decline was documented in secret; visitors were not supposed to 
look beyond the vast Soviet War Memorial built alongside. Restoration 
work, at the request of the Warsaw government, did not begin until 1989. 

In Western Europe, existing cemeteries generally survived the Second 
World War intact. Yet all over Eastern Europe, German, Jewish, Polish, 
Lithuanian, and Ukrainian cemeteries fell under the Communist campaign of 
oblivion. They were an obstacle to the rewriting of history. In the struggles 
of 1918-19, the defeated Ukrainians suffered similar casualties to those of 
their Polish foes. Yet the Ukrainian military cemetery in Lwow was 
honoured and tended throughout the years of Polish rule. Under Soviet rule, 
it was obliterated. 

In 1991, as the chief metropolis of western Ukraine, L'viv became the 
second city of the independent Ukrainian Republic. The defeated dreams of 
1918-19 were revived. The hopes of the young Poles buried at Lyczakow 
were finally dashed, [elsass]

The peace disease spread rapidly into Germany, and demands for peace 
turned rapidly into demands for the head of the Kaiser. The imperial fleet 
mutinied in port at Wilhelmshaven. Socialist revolution broke out in Munich on 
7 November, and in Berlin on the 9th, when the formation of a German Republic 
was proclaimed. On the 10th, having abdicated some days previously, Kaiser 
Wilhelm and the Crown Prince departed for exile in the Netherlands. In their 
very last throw, German military intelligence released their most dangerous 
Polish prisoner, Joseph Pilsudski, and put him on a train to Warsaw. He arrived 
on the morning of the 11th, supervised the disarming of the German garrison, 
and, to the chagrin of the Western Allies, took over the reins of an independent 
Poland. 



In the end, therefore, like Russia the Central Powers were brought down 
more by political collapse than by outright military defeat. The German army, 
victorious in the East, was still intact in the West; it was never driven back onto 
German territory. But it had parted company with the political authorities that 
gave it orders. Armistice negotiations took place from 8 November onwards at 
Rethondes-sur-Aisne, near Soissons. Agreement was soon reached on the basis 
of Wilson's 14 points plus 18 extra Allied demands. The latter concerned the 
evacuation of occupied territory, the creation of a neutral zone in the Rhineland, 
the surrender of Germany's fleet, heavy armament, and transport, the payment of 
reparations, and the annulment of the treaties of Brest-Litovsk and Bucharest. 
The Allies were insisting on capitulation terms so severe that they could dictate 
the terms of peace. The agreement was signed in a parked railway carriage at 3 
a.m. on the 11th, to come into force six hours later. The guns fell silent at the 
eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month. 

Over 10 million soldiers were dead-overwhelmingly, young married men or 
bachelors (see Appendix III, pp. 1328-9). Casualty rates were specially high 
among junior officers. They were called the dost generation', les sacrifies. The 
burden of their war service, of their loss, and of their injuries had to be borne by 
their families, especially by the womenfolk. Women during the war had been 
conscripted into jobs left vacant by the soldiers. They worked in the munitions 
factories, in offices, and in many occupations previously closed to them-as 
tram-drivers, managers, or journalists. For many girls this opened the road to 
social liberation, as symbolized by the fashion for short, 'bobbed' hair and for 
smoking in public. In the industrialized countries at least, European women 
moved out of the protective custody of their homes and families as never before. 
The change was reflected in the widespread advance of women's suffrage. But 
the social and psychological cost was enormous. The lost generation of young 
men was matched by an abandoned generation of young widows and lonely 
spinsters, whose life-chance of a partner had disappeared with their loved ones 
in the mud of the trenches. The demographic damage, and the imbalance of the 
sexes, were to have lasting effects. 

Statistics are not so comprehensible as the experience of individual families. 
On 5 September 1918, Second Lieutenant Norman Davies, aged 18, of Bolton, 
Lancashire, and of 11 Wing, 48 Fighter Squadron RAF, crashed in practice in a 
Bristol fighter near Saint-Omer, on his second day in France. His CO's report 
showed greater concern for the loss of the machine than for that of the pilot. ■ On 
11 November 1918 the Bolton family, also of Bolton, celebrated the end of the 


war. On the 12th they received the 'King's telegram' announcing, with regret, 
that their eldest son, Private James Bolton, aged 19, of 11 Battalion, East 
Lancashire Regiment, had died several minutes before the Armistice. Millions of 
French, German, Italian, Austrian, and Russian families suffered in the same 
way. 

Europe was full of war refugees-principally from Belgium, from Galicia, 
and from Serbia. On top of that came the biggest pandemic visited on Europe 
since the Black Death. The 'Spanish flu' killed more Europeans than the War 
did, including Private Bolton, [epidemia] Europe became the subject of a vast 
external relief effort. The International Red Cross and the American Relief 
Administration faced a task, especially in Eastern Europe, of unprecedented 
proportions. 

To say that Europe was at peace, however, was an exaggeration. Western 
Europe had won some respite; but there were huge areas of Central and Eastern 
Europe where all established order had broken down. A score of independent 
states had been born, every one at odds with its neighbours (see Map 25). The 
largest of them, Soviet Russia, was at war with most of its citizens and with all 
of its neighbours, and was acting as the provocateur to all sorts of revolutionary 
events elsewhere. Thus, while the victorious allies strove to make peace where 
they could, much of the Continent continued to be engulfed in raging conflict. 
'The War of the Giants has ended,' wrote Churchill, 'the wars of the pygmies 
begin.' Geopolitically, the Great Triangle had been flattened to the point where 
only the Western Powers remained intact. Russia had been knocked out by the 
Central Powers, and the Central Powers by the West. Yet Russia and Germany 
were both breathing; unlike Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, they 
were not total casualties. In November 1918 the Western Powers were granted 
no more than a breathing-space within which a stable European order might be 
built 'whilst Russia and Germany slept'. Unfortunately, the peace-making efforts 
of the Western Powers were seriously flawed from the start. 

The Peace Conference, which deliberated in Paris throughout 1919, was 
organized as a congress of victors, not as a general assembly of the European 
states. Neither Soviet Russia nor the German Republic was represented; and the 
other successor states were only admitted in their capacity as clients and 
petitioners. All the major decisions were taken by the Council of Ten, its 
successor, the Council of Four- Clemenceau, Lloyd George, Wilson, and 



sometimes Orlando of Italy-or, from January 1920, by the standing Conference 
of (Allied) Ambassadors. This in itself was sufficient to create the impression of 
a Diktat or 'imposed settlement'. Despite the high-flown pretensions of the 
organizers, the Peace Conference did not take responsibility for many of 
Europe's most urgent problems. It confined itself to the task of preparing treaties 
for signature by the ex-enemy states. Its reluctance to recognize the 
disintegration of the Russian Empire, whose interests it sought 'to hold in trust', 
had specially baleful consequences. The half-baked policy of Allied Intervention 
in Russia, which was half-heartedly pursued with half-measures throughout 
1919, played straight into the hands of the Bolsheviks (see pp. 931-2 below). 

Although the Wilsonian ideal of national self-determination was widely 
endorsed, it was not applied either consistendy or fairly. The victorious Allies 
saw no reason to discuss the aspirations of their own subject nationalities, such 
as the Irish, still less the wishes of colonial peoples. They encouraged far- 
reaching territorial changes at the expense of their ex-enemies, whilst 
discouraging demands at the expense of their own side. The Czechs, for 
example, whose demands encroached on Austria and Hungary, were fully 
supported in their claims to the medieval 'lands of St Wenceslas' (see Appendix 
III, p. 1317). The Poles, whose demand for the restoration of the frontiers of 
1772 was incompatible with the restoration of the Russian Empire, were roundly 
condemned for 'small-power imperialism'. For every satisfied customer there 
were two or three disgruntled ones. 

The Western Powers showed little sense of solidarity among themselves. The 
Americans suspected the British and French of imperialist designs. The British 
suspected the French of Napoleonic tendencies. Both the British and the French 
suspected the strength of America's commitment. Their fears were amply 
confirmed when the US Congress failed to ratify both the Treaty of Versailles 
with Germany and American membership of Wilson's pet project, the Feague of 
Nations (see below). Allied diplomacy greatly underestimated the problem of 
enforcement. It was one thing for the politicians to make grand decisions in 
Paris. It was quite another for the decisions to be upheld in distant parts of 
Europe where the Western Powers had little influence and no control. Assorted 
inter-Allied Commissions gave temporary relief to assorted trouble-spots. But 
the Feague of Nations was born toothless. The USA turned its back on the 
settlement; the British demobilized; France shrank from policing the Continent 
single-handed. It was only a matter of time before those offended by the 
settlement began to guess that they might challenge it with impunity. 



Of course, the Peace Conference worked its way through an astonishing 
amount of business. Five major treaties were put into effect. A dozen new states 
were given international recognition. A score of territorial awards were made. A 
batch of plebiscites were organized and administered. Much of Europe was 
given a basis for the new start which so many desired. Nor is it fair to say that 
the spirit of vengeance reigned supreme. As the Conference progressed, the tone 
softened. Lloyd George, the most flexible of the 'Big Three', arrived in January 
amidst cries of 'Hang the Kaiser!' but later took the lead in seeking the road of 
accommodation. The creation of the Free City of Danzig, for which he received 
no thanks, was an example of his moderating influence. There is no denying the 
vin-dictiveness which underlay the war guilt clauses, the principle of reparations, 
which set out to bill Germany for the entire cost of the war, and the one-sided 
plans for disarmament. At the same time, despite Clemenceau's intransigence, 
there was a growing sense that Allied demands must be tailored to the limits of 
German tolerance, [slesvig] 

Yet the resultant international climate was far from healthy. The mix of 
vengeance and cynicism portrayed by the victorious Allies did not augur well. 
Eastern Europe, the original source of conflict, was still unregulated. No sooner 
was the ink of the treaties dry than all sorts of people set out to revise them. 

Most of the wars which erupted in 1918-21 were fuelled by disputes of a purely 
local nature. Whole encyclopaedias have been filled with the rights and wrongs 
of obscure localities which made the news, from Allenstein to Zips. Yet four of 
the wars had wider implications. These were Russian Civil War, the Hungarian 
Civil War, the Polish-Soviet War, and the Graeco-Turkish War. On each 
occasion, the inability of the Western Powers to exercise a benign influence on 
the Eastern part of Europe was amply demonstrated. 

The 'Russian Civil War' of 1918-21 is arguably the victim of a misnomer. In 
reality, it was a series of civil wars and a series of international wars all rolled 
into one. It consisted of two main strands. One strand centred on a contest for 
control of the central Russian government, and was fought out between the 
Bolshevik 'Reds' and an assortment of their 'White' challengers. All the 
participants in this part of the proceedings aspired to the reconstitution of the 
Russian Empire in one form or another. A second strand involved a succession of 
conflicts between Reds or Whites on the one side and the independent republics 



of the former tsarist borderlands on the other. All the republics were fighting for 
the preservation of their new-found sovereignty. But that was not all. The Reds 
fielded local formations in each of the republics in addition to the central 
reserves based in Moscow. The Whites, too, fielded several separate armies. 
Numerous foreign forces intervened. The governments of the national republics 
were frequently confronted by local rivals; and there were a number ofloose 
cannon', such as the Czech Legion of ex-prisoners of war who in 1918 seized 
the Trans-Siberian Railway. As a result, the melee in most areas took the form of 
a multi-sided free-for-all. [b.n.r] 

In Ukraine, for example, which constituted one of the most valuable prizes, 
eleven armies took to the field. The forces of the Ukrainian Republic, which was 
formed in January 1918, were divided between supporters of the initial Rada or 
'National Council' and those of the subsequent Directory. The German army of 
occupation on the Eastern Front had stayed on until February 1919 in order to 
give aid to Ukraine's independence. The 'Red Army' of Ukraine had strong 
backing among Russian workers in the Donbass region, and was supplemented 
by units from the central Bolshevik command in Moscow. General Denikin's 
'Russian Volunteer Army', backed by a French force, landed in Odessa; its 
successor, Baron Wrangel's 'White Army', camped in Crimea. Pilsudski's Polish 
army defeated the forces of the West Ukrainian Republic in early 1919, before 
advancing on Kiev in April 1920 in alliance with the Ukrainian Directory. The 
peasant guerrillas of the anarchist, Nestor Makhno, took over a broad region of 
central Ukraine. The Ukrainian capital, Kiev, changed hands fifteen times in two 
years. To reduce such a kaleidoscope to the binary struggle of Reds versus 
Whites is simplification pushed to absurdity (see Appendix III, p. 1315). 

The course of events was no less complicated than the orare de bataille. But 
seen from the Bolsheviks' point of view in the centre, there were two successive 
phases, each with its own priorities. The first phase, which occupied the whole 
of 1918 and 1919, saw the Whites advance on Soviet Russia from all sides- 
General Yudenich from the West in Estonia, Admiral Kolchak from the East in 
Siberia, General Denikin from the South in Ukraine. The Bolsheviks were 
desperately strained to hold the Muscovite heartland and to repel each advancing 
army in turn. The second phase, which began in the winter of 1919-20, saw the 
'Red Army' take the offensive, pursuing each of the retreating Whites before 
moving on to crush each of the national republics in turn. 

The critical moment occurred in November 1919, when Denikin had reached 



Tula, only 100 miles south of Moscow, and the Poles stood not much further 
away, to the west near Smolensk. One concerted push might well have spelled 
the end of the Bolshevik regime. But Pilsudski's emissaries received no 
satisfactory answer about Denikin's attitude to the independence of Poland. So 
the Poles stood still, and began to negotiate with Lenin. Denikin hesitated fatally, 
until swept from his positions by the Red cavalry, hotfoot from their victory at 
the siege of Tsaritsyn. In his memoirs, Denikin was to blame Pilsudski for the 
Bolsheviks' final victory. 2 

After that, having secured the centre, numerous Red armies fanned out in all 
directions, carrying all before them. Their reconquest of the republics in the 
European part of the former Empire reached its term in 1921, when a Bolshevik 
force overthrew the Menshevik regime in Georgia (see Appendix III, p. 1314). 

The Bolsheviks' victory, which confounded the military experts, must be 
attributed to the divisions of their enemies, to the talents of Leon Trotsky, 
Commissar for War and the 'Russian Carnot', to the strategic advantage of 
internal lines of communication, and to the utterly ruthless measures of their 
'war communism'. The Bolshevik regime was unwelcome to all the major 
classes of Russian society, including the peasants, to all the major groupings of 
the political spectrum from reactionary monarchists to liberals and socialists, and 
to all the non-Russian nationalities. But the outbreak of civil war-which Lenin 
himself provoked- provided the pretext for suspending all existing institutions 
and for wiping out all social and political opposition. The Cheka or 
'Extraordinary Commission' of revolutionary police (forerunner of the OGPU, 
NKVD, and KGB) was organized by the Polish nobleman Felix Dzierzynski 
(1877-1926) with a ferocity that made Robespierre look faint-hearted. It struck 
down all 'class enemies', real or imagined, from the ex-Tsar and his family, 
murdered on Lenin's orders at Ekaterinburg in July 1918, to unnumbered 
multitudes of nameless victims. The militarization of all branches of the 
economy, including labour, transport, and production, enabled the Bolsheviks to 
take over all enterprises and trade unions, and to shoot all dissenters for 
'counter-revolutionary sabotage'. Popular support rarely came into the 
reckoning, except when the Bolsheviks could appeal to patriotic Russian 
sentiment against the presence of foreign 'interventionists'. In April 1920, when 
the Poles helped the Ukrainians to retake Kiev, all ideological pretence was cast 
aside. Lenin called for the defence of Holy Russia, and Trotsky for the 
enlistment of all ex-tsarist officers. Extreme necessity was the mother of extreme 
invention. 


SLESVIG 


On 10 July 1920, King Christian X rode on a white horse across the Danish 
frontier to reclaim the district of Sonderjylland ('South Jutland' or 'North 
Schleswig'), which had recently been awarded to Denmark by popular 
plebiscite. 1 Thus ended one of the most bitter and protracted territorial 
disputes of modern Europe. 

The neighbouring provinces of Schleswig and Holstein, situated at the 
base of the Jutland peninsula, had long formed the borderlands between 
Germany and Denmark. Historically, Schleswig-or 'Slesvig' in Danish- 
had been a Danish fief whilst Holstein had belonged to the Holy Roman 
Empire. The ancient 'Eider Stone' embedded in the city gate at Rensburg 
marks the Empire's traditional frontier. Although the population was 
ethnically mixed, Danish-speakers predominated in the north and German- 
speakers in the centre and south. (See Appendix III, p. 1305.) 

The 'Schleswig-Holstein Question' had first raised its head in 1806, 
when the French awarded both provinces to Denmark. The award was 
confirmed by the Congress of Vienna, but was subsequently rendered 
ambiguous when Holstein was declared a member of the German 
Confederation. It was a recipe for trouble. In an age of growing nationalism, 
the 'autochthonous Germans of the northern marches' demanded their 
secession from Denmark. Patriotic 'Danes on the Eider' rallied to resist 
them. Nationalist claims soon became embroiled with the struggles to 
establish constitutional government. In 1848 Prussian troops occupied 
Schleswig-Holstein in response to appeals from the German-dominated 
provincial assemblies. They were eventually forced to withdraw after both 
Britain and Russia threatened counter-measures. Prussia had its eyes on the 
naval port of Kiel. 2 

A further crisis was precipitated in November 1863, when Frederick VII 
of Denmark died without male heir, having just approved a joint constitution 
for 'Denmark-Schleswig'. Saxon and Hanoverian troops promptly moved in 
to secure Holstein. In 1864, amidst growing uproar, Prussia and Austria 
agreed to take joint action, establishing a six-year period of joint occupation 
of both provinces for the examination of all problems. These dispositions 



were overtaken by the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. The Prussians' victory 
enabled them to take sole control of the occupied lands, and then to annex 
them outright. Arrangements to hold a plebiscite, and to ease the position of 
people opting for Danish citizenship, were not honoured. 

Danish national pride was greatly aroused by the wars of 1848-51 and 
1863-4. The fortifications of the Dannevirke Line had seen heavy fighting; 
and points of fierce resistance, such as Dybbol Mill, were to become national 
shrines. Still more persistent were resentments caused by the maltreatment 
of the Danish 'optants', and by crude policies of germanizaron pursued, as in 
Prussian Poland, in the 1880s and 1890s. 

The Schleswig plebiscites of 1920 were instigated under Allied auspices 
in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles. In the northern district, they 
showed a 92 per cent majority for Denmark; in Flensburg and central 
Schleswig, a 75 per cent vote for Germany. The agreed frontier has lasted 
ever since. 

Lord Palmerston once said that only three people understood Schleswig- 
Holstein-'the Prince Consort, who was dead; a German professor, who had 
gone mad; and himself, who had forgotten all about it'. After 1920, the 
whole of Europe was free to follow Palmerston's example, though many 
similarly intractable disputes remained elsewhere. For every territorial 
conflict settled at that time, several new ones were created. 


Foreign intervention in Russia has been exaggerated. On the face of it, a 
terrible array of ill-intentioned outsiders had poked their noses into Russia's 
distress. The regular German army was left over from the World War in the 
Oberost. The volunteer German army of the 'Baltikum' tramped round Latvia 
and Lithuania, the Polish irregulars of General Bulak-Balakhovich round 
Byelorussia; regular Polish troops appeared in the Oberost as soon as the 
Germans withdrew. British expeditionary forces landed at Murmansk and at 
Batum in Georgia; the French occupied Odessa; Americans and Japanese 
controlled Vladivostok and the Far East. It was an easy trick for Soviet 
propaganda to turn these foreigners into a concerted conspiracy of evil 
capitalists, hired to destroy Russia. There was no such conspiracy. The Allied 
governments were mainly concerned to hold the Russian Empire together; they 
had nothing to do with the presence of the Germans, and especially of the Poles, 




who expressly defied Allied advice to stay out. The Allied expeditions were 
despatched to guard the munitions which had earlier been sent to Russian ports 
for the benefit of the Provisional Government. Their sympathies undoubtedly lay 
with their former Russian allies whom the Bolshevik coup had overthrown and 
who were now begging for help. But they never sent the men or the money to 
conduct serious military operations. They withdrew when everyone could see 
that their presence was handing a major propaganda success to the Bolsheviks. 
By then the damage was done; Soviet history books beat the nationalist drum on 
this point for decades. 

Western history books have their own peculiarities. The collapse of the 
Russian Empire is rarely discussed along the same lines as the parallel collapse 
of the Austro-Hungarian or Ottoman Empires. Except for Poland, Finland, and 
the three Baltic States, which were all recognized by the Peace Conference, the 
national republics that broke free from Russian control are not given the same 
status as those which broke away from the Central Powers. Few historians seem 
to regard Soviet Russia's reconquest of Ukraine or the Caucasus as anything 
other than an internal 'Russian' event. It is still more unfortunate that the 
creation of the Soviet Union, which began in December 1922, is often thought to 
have involved a mere change of name. In this way the lengthy process of 
decomposition of the Empire, and the five-year labours of the Bolsheviks to 
replace it, can be passed over in silence. Crucial distinctions between 'Russia', 
'the Russian Empire', 'Soviet Russia' (RSFSR), and 'the Soviet Union' (USSR) 
only entered general discourse when the Bolsheviks' handiwork started to fall 
apart 70 years later, [b.n.r,] 

The scale of the Russian Civil War is equally overlooked. Yet if the victims 
of the fighting, of the White and Red Terrors, and of the terrible Volga Famine 
are all added together, the total number of deaths would not be lower than the 
mortality on all fronts of the Great War.- 

The collapse of the Habsburg Empire was attended by a number of serious 
conflicts, but none more serious than in Hungary. The Soviet Republic of 
Hungary lasted for five months, from March to August 1919. Many European 
communist parties were founded at that time; but Budapest was the only city 
outside Russia where a communist regime managed to take power for any length 
of time. The short career of the first 'Hungarian Revolution' is very instructive. 
It was given its chance when the initial, liberal government of independent 


Hungary resigned in protest against the punitive nature of the peace settlement. 
Most Hungarians were appalled by the prospect of losing both Slovakia and 
Transylvania, which they saw as cradles of their civilization. The communist 
leader, Bela Kun (1886-71939), a Jewish ex-prisoner of war freshly returned 
from Russia, exploited the nationalist fever. The Hungarian communists took 
power with the support both of the social democrats and the old officer corps, 
promising to drive the Slovaks and the Romanians from the disputed lands. In 
June 1919 a Hungarian army actually invaded Slovakia. At the same time a new 
Constitution was passed by delegates of workers' and soldiers' councils on the 
Soviet model, and radical reforms were decreed. All industry was nationalized; 
church property was confiscated; priests and peasants were subjected alike to 
compulsory labour. 


B.N.R. 

Until recently, most Western historians were totally unaware of the 
Byelorussian National Republic (BNR), which was proclaimed in Miensk 
(Minsk) on 25 March 1918. Indeed, most Westerners were unaware that 
Byelorussia or Belarus' was anything other than a district of Russia, 1 Before 
1918, squeezed between Poland and Russia, Belarus' had never known a 
separate political existence. Once known to the outside world as 'White 
Ruthenia', it had formed a major part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, but 
had been submerged since the Partitions in the Tsarist Empire where it was 
renamed 'White Russia' (see pp. 655, 663). 

German support during the First World War greatly strengthened the 
country's separate national consciousness. In 1914-15 Byelorussian schools, 
bookstores, newspapers, and publishers began to operate in Vilna (Wilno) 
and Minsk. On 1 January 1916, a decree signed by Field Marshal von 
Hindenburg recognized Byelorussian asan official language in territories 
occupied by the German army. In 1916-17 Byelorussian theatres, 
seminaries, pedagogical institutes, and eventually political parties were free 
to organize. 

The initiative was taken by a democratic socialist grouping, the 
Hramada. A Byelorussian National Congress assembled in Minsk in 




December 1917, only to be dispersed by the Bolsheviks. But the further 
advance of German forces in February 1918 expelled the Reds, and enabled 
the locals to take charge. The BNR, which was pledged to the welfare of all 
nationalities-Ruthenian, Polish, Jewish, Lithuanian, and Tartar-functioned 
until the end of the year. It was forcibly suppressed in 1919 by the return of 
the Red Army, which created first a joint Lithuanian-Byelorussian SSR and 
then a Byelorussian SSR. 

During the Polish-Soviet War of 1919-20 (see pp. 934-7) most of 
Byelorussia was occupied by the Poles. The Treaty of Riga (1921) 
partitioned the country without reference to the population's wishes. Under 
Soviet rule, the eastern sector was subject to repressions whose recipients 
regard them as 'genocide'. 2 The horrors continued in 1939-45 through Nazi 
murders and Stalinist deportations. But the memory of the BNR lived on. In 
1992, when the Republic of Belarus' was restored, the visiting doyen of the 
European Parliament expressed the firm conviction that Belarus' had every 
right to be a candidate for future membership of the European Community. 3 
He was rather more sanguine on this point than many of the local population, 
whose administrative and managerial class had been almost completely 
sovietized and russified. The appalling modern history of Belarus' had 
ensured that it was far more dependent on Russia than any of the other ex- 
Soviet republics. 


At this point Hungary awoke to the monster it was feeding. Strikers were met 
by bullets. Armed peasant risings faced mass executions. A group of dissident 
officers formed at French-occupied Szeged. They were joined by Nicholas 
Horthy de Nagybanya (1868-1957), a former Habsburg admiral, and a 
government was created. The Romanians exploited the situation, and it was a 
Romanian army that entered Budapest in August and brought the Hungarian 
Soviet Republic to an end. 

The Red Terror was now answered by a White Terror. Indiscriminate 
vengeance was wreaked on Kun's followers, especially communists and Jews. In 
1920 Horthy was declared Regent, and instituted a dictatorship that lasted for 24 
years. Two attempts by the ex-Emperor Charles to. recover his Hungarian throne 
were rebuffed, as were attempts by the parliament to shake off military control. 
Although the 'Fascist' label was not yet used, and may not be entirely 




appropriate, Admiral Horthy is sometimes counted as 'Europe's first Fascist'. 
Not for the last time, however, an extreme communist adventure had provoked a 
strong anti-communist reaction (see Appendix III, p. 1318).- 

The Polish-Soviet War of 1919-20 had implications for the whole of Europe. 
Contrary to the Bolshevik version of events, it was not organized by the Entente; 
it was not part of Allied intervention in Russia; and it did not begin with 
Pilsudski's attack on Kiev in April 1920. Of course, a territorial dispute did exist. 
But the main source of conflict lay in the Bolsheviks' declared intention of 
linking their Revolution in Russia with the expected revolution in Germany, and 
hence of marching through Poland. This course of action was quite explicit in 
early Bolshevik ideology, and was a necessary step if the Soviet experiment in 
Russia was to be brought into line with Marxist doctrine. 

The Bolsheviks first thought of marching across The Red Bridge' to 
Germany in the winter of 1918-19. At that time they ordered the Red 'western 
army' to probe the Polish borderlands. However, such were the demands of the 
civil war that the necessary million-strong strike force could not be assembled 
until a year later. Trotsky always expressed caution; and despite public 
utterances about the 'infantile disease of leftism', it was Lenin who became the 
enthusiast for revolutionary war.- Regular fighting between Poles and Soviets 
began in February 1919, almost by accident, and continued for 20 months. It 
started when the German army evacuated the intervening area of the Oberost. 
Polish and Soviet forces were drawn into the vacuum from either side. The 
initial clash took place in Byelorussia at 6 a.m. on the morning of 14 February, 
when a Polish cavalry patrol disturbed a Bolshevik encampment at breakfast. At 
the time, Pilsudski was hoping to organize a federation of all the border 
republics, from Finland to Georgia. His scheme was repeatedly spiked by 
Poland's dispute with Lithuania. But by August 1919, having taken both Wilno 
and Minsk, he was standing on Poland's historic frontiers. He was tempted to 
help Denikin (see above), but in the event opened negotiations with the 
Bolsheviks. 

For the Poles, the problem lay in the discrepancy between Bolshevik slogans 
and Bolshevik deeds. All the time that Lenin was making extravagant speeches 
about peace with Poland, the Red Army's strike-force on the Berezina was 
steadily growing. So the Poles waited. In January 1920 Pilsudski made a foray 
across the frozen Dvina to confirm the independence of Latvia. Then he received 


the signal which he most feared: the command of Soviet forces on the Polish 
front had been given to the most successful Red general, the young Mikhail 
Tukhachevsky (1893-1937), conqueror of Siberia and theorist of revolutionary 
warfare. Convinced that the Bolsheviks' long-postponed offensive was about to 
be launched, Pilsudski patched up a belated alliance with one of the Ukrainian 
factions and struck the Bolsheviks at their weakest point, in the south. The Poles 
and Ukrainians marched into Kiev, and were welcomed as liberators. 
Tukhachevsky's preparations were interrupted. In the West, people who 
understood neither the politics nor the geography took up the Bolshevik shout of 
'Hands off Russia'. 

The campaign of 1920 was no border skirmish. It was a vast war of 
movement, which inspired the young adviser to the French military mission in 
Warsaw, Col. Charles de Gaulle, to formulate his new ideas on modern warfare. 
Up to a million men on either side marched the best part of a thousand miles and 
back in six months. The arrival of the Red cavalry drove the Poles out of 
Ukraine in May-June. Their commander boasted of 'clattering through the 
streets of Paris before the summer is out'. On 4 July Tukhachevsky finally 
launched his offensive with the order: 'To the West! Over the corpse of White 
Poland lies the road to world-wide conflagration.' The speed of his advance was 
phenomenal. In mid-August his cavalry reached the bend of the Vistula near 
Thorn, only five days' march from Berlin. Dzierzynski stood by in the rear, 
ready to assume power in Poland with a 'Polish Revolutionary Committee'. 
Lenin cabled him to shoot more landlords. In Warsaw the papal legate, the future 
Pius XI, prepared to brave the hordes of Antichrist in person. Volunteers, 
including many Jews, flocked to defend their homeland. The Western 
governments despatched several generals, but no reinforcements, [konarmya] 

The 'Miracle on the Vistula' occurred on 15-16 August. Pilsudski had 
secretly prepared a counter-attack from the southern flank. Tukhachevsky had 
failed to protect his extended lines of communication. When Pilsudski struck, 
five Soviet armies were decapitated. Three of them were annihilated; another 
took refuge in East Prussia. The rout was complete. On 31 August in the south, 
in the 'Zamosc Ring', the Red cavalry finally met its match. In the last great 
cavalry battle of European history, 20,000 horsemen charged and counter¬ 
charged in full formation, until the Polish uhlans carried the day. The Red Army 
had lost its first war. Lenin sued for peace. An armistice was signed on 10 
October, the Treaty of Riga on 18 March 1921. 



The wider significance of the Polish victory has not always been appreciated. 
Poland's independence was secured, and with it the Versailles settlement. The 
British Ambassador to Berlin, who had viewed some of the action near Warsaw 
from his Rolls-Royce coupe, summed it up in Gibbonian tones: 

If Charles Martel had not checked the Saracen conquest at Tours... the Koran 
would now be taught at the schools of Oxford.... Had Pilsudski and Weygand 
failed to arrest the triumphant march of the Soviet Army at the Battle of Warsaw, 
not only would Christianity have experienced a dangerous reverse, but the very 
existence of western civilisation would have been imperilled.- 


KONARMYA 

In the summer of 1920 Izaak Babel' (1894-1941) was serving on the Polish 

I front as a war correspondent of Yug-ROSTA, the South Russian Press 
Agency. He was attached to Budyonny's 1st Red Cavalry Army, whose 
political commissar was J. V. Stalin (see p. 959). He later wrote up his 
experiences in Konarmiya (Red Cavalry, 1926), a masterful collection of 
short stories which throb with the immediacy of historical realism: 

Crossing the River Zbrucz 

The Divisional Commander reported that Novograd-Volhinsk had been 
captured at dawn. The Staff advanced from Krapivno, and the noisy 
rearguard of our train was stretched out all along the eternal road which 
Nicholas I once built from Brest to Warsaw on the bones of peasants ... * 1 

In this, the first paragraph of the first story, the reader might be forgiven for 
imagining that real events were being reported as they really happened. 

Anyone familiar with the Polish-Soviet war, however, must soon smell a 
rat. There was a town called Novograd-Volhinsk, of course. In 1920 it was 
the headquarters of Semeon Petliura's Ukrainian Directory. Yet it lies not on 
the Zbrucz but on the Slucz; and it was captured not by the 1st Cavalry but 
by the Soviet 14th Army. There was indeed a high-road from Warsaw to 





Brest built by serfs under Nicholas I. But it lay 200 miles beyond Novo- 
grad, and could not possibly have been cluttered by the rearguard.... 

Numerous such examples show that Babel' was not simply making 
mistakes. He was deliberately jumbling dates, names, places, and events in 
order to create a precisely calculated effect. He was engaged in a form of 
literary collage, whose appearance is often more 'historical' than history 
itself'. 'He is quite content to burgle history, so long as the resulting haul is 
artistically satisfying.' The same can be said for his cult of violence. Red 
Cavalry is written in a special brand of 'faction', which is not historically 
accurate. 2 

Yet, taken in isolation, many of the facts can be verified. In Squadron 
Leader Trunov Babel' tells the story of a macho Cossack commander who 
went out one day to shoot down one of the American volunteer pilots who 
were fighting for the Poles. The memoirs of the American 'Kosciuszko 
Squadron', under Col. Cedric E. Fauntleroy, agree exactly with Babel"s 
account. They relate how a foolhardy Soviet machine-gunner kept firing at 
the American planes from an unprotected clearing, and how one of them 
peeled off, executed a low-level run, and shot him to pieces. 3 

In the long run, Babel' fared no better. The author who perhaps did most 
to spread the fame of the Red Army died in Stalin's Gulag. 


Yet the impact on the Bolsheviks was equally great. The defeat of 1920 
killed their strategic hopes of linking up with a revolutionary Germany. They 
were forced to retreat from internationalism. Soviet Russia had no option but to 
turn itself into the base for what Stalin was soon to call 'socialism in one 
country'. Lenin retreated quickly from his leftist fervour. War communism was 
abandoned. In the same week in March 1921 that peace was signed with Poland, 
Lenin introduced his tactical compromise with capitalism-the New Economic 
Policy, known as NEP. 

What is more, once Byelorussia and Ukraine were partitioned with Poland, 
the Bolsheviks were free to reorganize their state on federal lines. The formation 
of the USSR-which consisted initially of Soviet Russia, Soviet Byelorussia, 
Soviet Ukraine, and the Soviet Caucasus-could not have been undertaken until 
the Polish war had settled the fate of the borderlands. In reality, the Poles had 




won no more than a breathing-space: the Soviets' advance into Europe had been 
repulsed, but not abandoned (see Appendix III, p. 1316). 

The final collapse of the Ottoman Empire can hardly have come as a surprise. 
Yet the Western Powers held no contingency plans. They had once thought of 
installing their Russian allies on the Straits; but they were not going to grant 
such a favour to the Bolsheviks. So Greece, with Allied approval, moved into a 
vacuum. 

In August 1920 the Treaty of Sevres was signed by a rump Ottoman 
government with little authority. An Allied fleet held Istanbul. The Italians 
occupied the southern coast; the French, Cilicia; separatist Kurds and Armenians 
held large regions in the east. The Greeks held both Thrace and Smyrna (Izmir). 
They had long memories of Constantinople, torn from Christendom in 1453; and 
they had genuine fears about the large Greek population of Asia Minor. So, when 
the last Ottoman parliament failed to ratify the Treaty, the Supreme Allied 
Council in Paris invited the Greeks £ to restore order in Anatolia'. They had not 
counted on Kemal Pasha. 

In the previous two years, Kemal had surfaced at the head of a Turkish 
national movement dedicated to the creation of a national republic based on a 
modern, secular society. His HQ was in Ankara, in the Turkish-speaking 
heartland. The hero of Gallipoli, he was the sworn enemy of the Sultan, the 
mosque, and the veil. A war against foreign invaders was exactly what he 
needed. In this light, the outcome of the Graeco-Turkish campaigns of 1920-2 
was fairly predictable. The lonely Greek force marched up onto the Anatolian 
plateau, until held on the River Sakarya. Kemal roused the Turks to defend their 
native soil. In 1922 the Greek retreat turned into a rout: Smyrna fell; the Greek 
forces were driven into the sea. The great majority of Greeks from Asia Minor, 
where their ancestors had lived for three millennia, together with the Pontic 
Greeks of the Black Sea littoral, were expelled. For them, this was 'the Great 
Catastrophe'. Most of them would be exchanged for the Turkish population of 
northern Greece, which was expelled at the same time. In the process, Kemal 
established himself as Ghazi Pasha or 'Warrior Lord', and eventually as Atatilrk, 
the 'Father of the Turks'; and the Sultan was deposed. 

Allied intervention in Turkey offered a more blatant case of foreign 
interference than that in Russia. But the effect was the same. It stimulated what it 
was supposed to restrain. The Republic of Turkey established exclusive control 



of its national territory. The imposed Treaty of Sevres had to be replaced by the 
negotiated Treaty of Lausanne (1923). Greece and Turkey undertook to organize 
an extensive exchange of population; and the demilitarized Straits were handed 
over to yet another International Commission.- At which point the chain of 
conflicts generated by the Great War finally ground to a temporary halt, 
[SOCIALIS] 

The Inter-War Period 

In the inter-war period, which conventionally begins on Armistice Day in 
November 1918 and ends on 1 September 1939, Europe never escaped the 
shadow of war. The 1920s were passed amidst the after-shocks. The 1930s were 
passed in the growing conviction that a second quake was brewing. At the time 
there were statesmen and historians, including Churchill, who argued that lack of 
decisive action against the peace-breakers would inevitably lead to a renewal of 
conflict. In theory, their warnings proved to be correct; but they ignored both the 
political and the military realities. The Western democracies, horrified by the 
losses of 1914-18, could not be galvanized into action at the first sign of trouble. 
Also, their experiences with limited Tire-brigade' operations were dispiriting. 
Allied intervention in Russia had shown that the West possessed neither the will 
nor the resources to control the Bolsheviks. French occupation of the Ruhr was 
to show that Germany could not be coerced by measured means. From then on, 
most military staffs were convinced that it had to be full-scale war or nothing. 
And full-scale war could not be prepared overnight. 

What is more, if Russia and Germany could not be restrained separately, 
there was no chance of restraining them if they chose to work together. This 
nightmare was first glimpsed in April 1922, when German and Soviet delegates 
attending an Inter-Allied economic conference at Genoa decided to take an 
unscheduled train ride along the riviera to Rapallo, and to sign a German-Soviet 
trade treaty without reference to their outraged Allied hosts. In itself, the Rapallo 
incident was not crucial; but it revealed the central weakness of the Allies' 
victory: it revealed that Moscow and Berlin in concert could defy the West with 
impunity. Often unspoken, it underlay all of Europe's peacetime deliberations 
until the nightmare finally turned to reality.

The New Europe, 1917-1922 


SOCIALIS 

In the spring of 1920, the election results obliged the King of Sweden to I 
invite a socialist to head the government. But he did so reluctantly. He called 
in the leader of the Social Democratic Workers' Party, Karl Hjalmar Branting 
(1860-1925), and said that he could become prime minister so long as there 
was 'no socialism, no disarmament, and no constitutional change'. For a 
socialist party which had demanded defence cuts to finance social welfare, 
and which had demanded a republic, these were tough conditions. But the 
deal was struck; and Branting formed a coalition cabinet. The first step had 












been taken in the governmental career of a party whose record of office was 
to be unequalled in the democratic world. 

The Sveriges Socialdemokratiska Arbetarparti had been founded over 
thirty years before, in 1889. Closely modelled on the German SPD, it forgot 
its initial flirtation with Marxism and moved instead towards the 
parliamentary path and to a programme of social reform, redistribution of 
wealth, and state intervention. Like the British Labour Party, it possessed 
strong links with the trades unions, including block membership by 
affiliation; and it was well organized at the local level in workers' 
communes. Its electoral muscle consisted mainly of Sweden's new class of 
industrial workers, with an important leaven of middle-class and intellectual 
support. It gained a foothold in the Riksdag in 1896, and scored a landslide 
electoral success in 1914. By 1920 Branting commanded the largest single 
party in both houses of parliament. 

Sweden's system of proportional representation, which had been 
introduced in 1909 together with universal male suffrage, made it difficult 
for any one party to win a clear majority. Four democratic parties-the 
Conservatives, Liberals, Peasants', and Socialists-participated in the main 
forum, and coalition or caretaker ministries were a frequent occurrence. A 
small Communist Party was also represented. Prior to the constitutional 
reform of 1952, it was possible for parties to run electoral cartels to increase 
their representation. 

The SSDA's rise to power and influence passed through several phases. 
In the 1920s Branting headed three coalitions-in 1920, 1921-3, and 1924- 
5(6). He once lost out through an unemployment bill, and once through his 
drive for defence cuts. He never formed a majority government. 

From 1932 Branting's successor, Per Albin Hansson, began to give the 
SSDA the look of a permanent ruling party. With one brief interval, he was 
to control Swedish government for fourteen years. The ministry of 1936-9 
was a 'Red-Green Coalition' with the Peasant Movement, and that of 1939- 
45 a multi-party wartime coalition of national unity. 

After the war, the Social Democrats gained such a hold that they could 
transform Sweden in their own image. Tage Erlander held office for twenty- 
three years from 1946. Sweden's prosperity was as high as its taxation and 
its standards of state-sponsored health, education, and social security. 1 A 
brief period of conservative rule separated the two socialist ministries of 



Olaf Palme (1969-76, 1982-6). The SSDA fortress did not crumble until 
1988-after an unparalleled run of over half a century. And despite the 
King's fears in 1920, the Swedish monarchy outlasted the socialists. 

As for Socialism sitting uneasily in one of Europe's richest countries, the 
paradox was more apparent than real. Socialist ideas can only be effectively 
applied where there is a substantial -productive surplus to distribute and a 
democratic government to ensure equitable distribution. Indeed, they worked 
ever less efficiently in Sweden as the gap between available resources and 
popular aspirations narrowed. Yet in countries where the surplus is meagre, 
or the government dictatorial, or both, the workers in a collective economy 
are vulnerable to exploitation and the ruling elite hoards all the benefits. 
Such was the case in the Soviet Union, The world's first socialist state', 
which was not truly socialist either in spirit or in practice. 


The limitations of the Western Powers were also made apparent in the wider 
world beyond Europe. Major problems of the Pacific, of China, and of global 
maritime power had to be settled at the Washington Conference of 1921-2, not 
at the Peace Conference in Paris. The Washington Naval Agreement (1921) set 
limits to naval tonnage in the ratios of USA 5 : Britain 5 : Japan 3 : France 1.5 : 
Italy 1.5. In the Gondra Treaty of 1923, the USA made its dispositions in Latin 
America without involving its former European partners. The centre of gravity 
of world power was shifting. Europe was no longer the sole master of its fate. 

The legacy of the Peace Conference was not what its organizers would have 
wanted. Germany was gravely wounded, but not reconciled. The infant German 
Republic was extremely fragile. Its National Assembly, which met in permanent 
session at Weimar throughout 1919, was run by a coalition dominated by social 
democrats. Its representatives only signed the Treaty of Versailles under the 
express threat of coercion. Emotional ceremonies were staged to bid farewell to 
the Germans excluded from the Reich. Berlin, which had already experienced 
the left-wing rising of January 1919, when Rosa Luxemburg was murdered, now 
saw the right-wing Kapp Putsch of March 1920, and in August the approach of 
the Red Army. One cannot say what would have happened if Tukhachevsky had 
reached his destination. But by driving the Poles from disputed towns and 
handing those towns over to local Germans, he had betrayed his intention of 
playing the German card and of overthrowing the Versailles settlement. Three- 




hundred thousand armed Freikorps members were still on the loose. 'Red 
Saxony' was held by communists, Bavaria by ultra-conservatives talking of 
secession. Germany was one step from chaos. 

The spectre of social upheaval stalked the land. The violent hostility of the 
German left and the German right was growing. In 1922 the Jewish Minister of 
Reconstruction, Walter Rathenau, was assassinated. Radical socialists fed on 
mass unemployment and the dire effects of hyperinflation. Radical nationalists 
fed on the humiliation of the war guilt clauses, on resistance to reparations, and 
on Allied occupation of the Rhineland. A new variety of desperado, seeking to 
fuse the grievances of both Left and Right, surfaced after 1920 in the National 
Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP). Their leader, Adolf Hitler, reached 
the headlines on 8-9 November 1923, in the abortive fiasco of the 'Beer-cellar 
Putsch ' in Munich. 

For a time, however, a modicum of confidence was restored in Germany by 
Gustav Stresemann (1878-1929), sometime Chancellor and, from 1923, Foreign 
Minister. Stresemann allowed the German military to evade the disarmament 
clauses through secret co-operation with the Soviets. But he won Western 
approval by suppressing the communist governments in Saxony and Thuringia, 
and by restoring reparation payments. He then persuaded the Allies that the 
battle over reparations was harming Europe's economy. In 1924, under the 
Dawes Plan, he negotiated a loan from the USA of 800 million marks backed by 
gold, which assured the recovery of German industry. In 1925, at Locarno, in 
exchange for a guarantee of the Franco-German frontier, he obtained Germany's 
rehabilitation as a member of the international community, and in 1926 her 
admission to the League of Nations. In 1927 the last Inter-Allied Commissions 
were withdrawn. In the glow of improved relations with the West, few people 
cared to notice that Germany's eastern frontiers, and Germany's eastern policy, 
had been left open to revision. 

In the realm of international finance, confusion reigned for years. Thanks to 
the arrangements of the wartime Entente, Britain and France were owed colossal 
sums, principally by Russia, whilst they themselves owed still greater sums, 
principally to the USA. The reparations plan incorporated into the Treaty of 
Versailles sought to make Germany pay the entire costs of the war, so that Allied 
governments could then pay off their war debts. But the plan proved 
unworkable: the sums involved could not be properly calculated; Germany 
refused full payment; the Soviet Government refused to recognize the debts of 



the Tsar; and the USA refused to consider rescheduling. So alternative 
arrangements had to be made. Already at the Peace Conference a British 
delegate, J. M. Keynes, had published stringent criticism of the prevailing 
approach. In his Economic Consequences of the Peace (1919) he argued that 
support for the economic recovery of Germany was a precondition for the 
recovery of Europe as a whole, and that punitive reparations would harm the 
enforcers. His ideas met strong political opposition, partly because he seemed to 
be recommending preferential treatment for Germany over Germany's alleged 
victims. But it gradually came to be realized that recovery must have priority. 

Reparations initially fixed at 269 million German Goldmarks payable over 
42 years, i.e. to 1962, were successively reduced. In 1921 the British made a 
move by promoting an Anglo-Soviet Trade Treaty, thereby breaking the boycott 
of the Bolsheviks. Having pressed for a reduction of German reparations to 132 
billion Goldmarks, they acquiesced in the French threat to occupy the Ruhr if the 
reduced payments were not met. In 1922 they proposed the cancellation of all 
war debts, alternatively the limitation of British repayments to the USA to £33 
million per annum over 63 years, i.e. to 1985. In 1923, having fuelled Germany's 
hyperinflation by their demands, the French occupied the Ruhr to no good effect. 
In 1924, under the Dawes Plan, moderation at last prevailed. Germany was to 
pay reparations at a moderate rate until 1929, then at 2,500 million Reichsmarks 
per annum. An Allied loan of 800 million RM was to facilitate the next 
instalment. But even this proved impossible. In 1929, under the Young Plan, 
Germany was told to pay 34,500 million GM annually over 58 years, i.e. to 
1988, on a mortgage secured against the German state railways. In 1932, at the 
Fausanne Conference, Germany was invited to make one final payment of 3,000 
million RM-which was not achieved. By that time the whole business had 
become irrelevant. Germany had been receiving more by way of US loans than 
she was paying in reparations. In any case, as from 24 October 1929, the day of 
the Great Crash on the New York Stock Exchange, the world economy was 
moving into depression; and all US loans to Europe were suspended. 

Inter-war politics were dominated by the recurrent spectacle of liberal 
democracies falling prey to dictatorship. The Western Powers had hoped that 
their victory would usher in an era modelled in their own image. After all, at the 
start of the Great War the European Continent contained 19 monarchies and 3 
republics; at the end, it consisted of 14 monarchies and 16 republics. Yet the 
'Democratic Revolution' soon proved illusory. Hardly a year passed when one 



country or another did not see its democratic constitution violated by one or 
other brand of dictator. It cannot be attributed to any simple cause, save the 
inability of the Western Powers to defend the regimes which they had inspired. 
The dictators came in all shapes and sizes-communists, fascists, radicals, and 
reactionaries, left-wing authoritarians (like Pilsudski), right-wing militarists (like 
Franco), monarchs, anti-monarchists, even a cleric like Father Tiso in Slovakia. 
The only thing they shared was the conviction that Western democracy was not 
for them (see Appendix III, p. 1320). [eesti] 

Of the two new states to come into existence between the wars, one, Ireland, 
was a national republic, the other, the Vatican state, an apostolic dictatorship. 
The Irish Free State was established in 1922, initially as a sovereign dominion of 
the British Empire. Millions of Irishmen had loyally served in the British army 
during the Great War. But opinion in 1918 was still split by the prospect of 
Home Rule. Ulster prepared once again to defend the Union by force, and in 
1920 was turned into an autonomous province of the UK. The predominantly 
Catholic southerners prepared for independence. They succeeded, but only after 
two vicious wars-one against a British paramilitary police force, the 'Black and 
Tans', the other a civil war amongst themselves. The dominant personality, and 
many times Premier, Eamon de Valera (1882-1975), was a half-Cuban Catholic 
born of an Irish mother in New York. The Free State declared itself the Republic 
of Eire in 1937, severing all formal ties with Great Britain in 1949. 


EESTI 

In 1923 one of the first offices of Count Coudenhove-Kalergi's Pan-I 
European League was opened in the capital of Estonia, Tallin. Outside the 
office door was a brass plate with the inscription paneuropa union Estonia. 
Seventeen years later, when the Soviet Army invaded Estonia, the plate was 
hidden by members of the League. In 1992, during the visit to Estonia by the 
doyen of the European Parliament, Dr Otto von Habsburg, it was brought out 
of hiding and presented to him. It was the symbol of Estonia's hidden 
aspirations, invisible to the outside world for half a century. 'Don't forget the 
Estonians!', said Dr von Habsburg; 'they are the best of Europeans.' 1 

At the time, admirers of the Soviet Union were saying that the Baltic 




States were too tiny to be viable, sovereign countries. Similar things were 
said about the new-born republics of Yugoslavia. The point is: Estonia, or 
Latvia, or Slovenia, or Croatia, would be extremely vulnerable if left in 
isolation. But as members of the European Community they would be every 
bit as viable as the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg or an independent Wales or 
Scotland. After all, Estonia is nearly twenty times larger than Luxembourg, 
and is four times as populous. In a united Europe, every small country can 
find its place alongside the former great powers. 


The Vatican State, which was almost as papist as Eire, was created in 1929 in 
pursuance of the Lateran Treaty signed by Mussolini's Italy and Pope Pius XI. It 
covered 44 hectares (c.100 acres) on the right bank of the Tiber in central Rome. 
Its population of perhaps 1,000 resident souls was to be ruled by the absolute 
authority of the Pope. Its creation ended 60 years of the Pope's 'captivity' since 
the suppression of the Papal States in 1870. 

Despite the victory of the Western democracies, the most dynamic political 
product of the Great War lay in the anti-Western, anti-liberal, and anti¬ 
democratic monster of totalitarianism. The term was coined by Italian fascists to 
describe their own aspirations. But it was taken up from 1928 to encompass the 
common denominator of both fascism and communism. After the suppression of 
Soviet Hungary, Soviet Russia (1917-22) and its successor, the USSR (from 
1923), long remained the sole communist state. Its example was immensely 
influential. The main fascist regimes emerged in Italy (1922), Germany (1933), 
and Spain (1936).- 

The concept of totalitarianism was rejected both by communists and by 
fascists, that is, by the totalitarians themselves. It was destined to become a 
political football in the era of the Cold War, and it has enjoyed only mixed 
fortunes among Western academics and political theorists.- It has failed to 
attract those who demand tidy, watertight models, or who identify political 
phenomena with social forces. It is anathema, and abominable 'relativism', to 
anyone who holds either communism or fascism to be uniquely evil. On the 
other hand, it is strongly supported by those Europeans who have had practical 
experience of both communism and fascism at first hand. Communism and 
fascism were never identical: each of them evolved over time, and each spawned 





variegated offspring. But they had much more in common than their 
practitioners were prepared to admit. The features which they shared form a long 
list. A seminal study on the subject talks in terms of'a six-point syndrome'.- But 
six points are not enough: 

Nationalist-Socialist ideology. Both communism and fascism were 
radical movements which developed ideologies professing a blend of 
nationalist and socialist elements. During the 1920s the Bolsheviks 
gradually watered down their inter-nationalist principles, whilst adopting 
the characteristic postulates of extreme Russian nationalism. Under 
Stalin, the ideological mix was classified as 'National Bolshevism'. The 
German Nazis modified the socialist elements of their ideology over the 
same period. In both cases the socialist-nationalist or nationalist-socialist 
blend was stabilized at the same moment, in 1934. 

At the conscious level, communists and fascists were schooled to stress 
their differences. On the other hand, when pressed to summarize their 
convictions, they often gave strikingly similar answers. One said, 'For us 
Soviet patriots, the homeland and communism became fused into one 
inseparable whole.' Another put it thus: 'Our movement took a grip on 
cowardly Marxism, and extracted the [real] meaning of socialism from it. It 
also took Nationalism from the cowardly bourgeois parties. Throwing both 
together into the cauldron of our way of life, the synthesis emerged as clear 
as crystal-German National Socialism.'- It is not for nothing that people 
treated to such oratory were apt to think of communists as 'red fascists' and 
of fascists as 'brown communists'. 

Pseudo-science. Both communists and fascists claimed to base their 
ideologies on fundamental scientific laws which supposedly determined 
the development of human society. Communists appealed to their version 
of 'scientific Marxism' or historical materialism, the Nazis to eugenics 
and racial science. In neither case did their scientific methods or findings 
find widespread independent endorsement. 

Utopian goals. All totalitarians cherished the vision of a New Man who 
was to create a New Order cleansed of all present impurities. The nature 
of the vision varied. It could be the final, classless stage of pure 
communism as preached by the Marxist-Leninists; the .racist, Jew-free 
Aryan.paradise of the Nazis: or the restoration of a pseudo-historical 


Roman empire in Italy. The building of the New Order was a task which 
justified all the sacrifices and brutalities of the present, [utopia] 

The dualist party-state. Once in power, the totalitarian party created 
organs within its own apparatus to duplicate and to oversee all other 
existing institutions. State structures were reduced to the status of 
conveyor belts for executing the Party's wishes. This dualist dictatorial 
system was much more pervasive than that implied by the familiar but 
misleading term of the 'one-party state'. (See Appendix III, p. 1321.) 

The Fiihrerprinzip or 'Leader Principle'. Totalitarian parties operated on 
strict hierarchical lines. They exacted slavish obedience from their 
minions, through the unquestioning cult of the Party Leader, the fount of 
all wisdom and beneficence-the Filhrer, the Vozhd', the Duce, the 
Caudillo or the 'Great Helmsman'. Lenin shunned such a cult: but it was 
a centrepiece both of Stalinism and of Hitlerism. 

Gangsterism. Many observers have noted the strong similarity between 
the conduct of totalitarian elites and that of professional criminal 
confraternities. Gangsters gain a parasitical hold over a community by 
'protecting' it from the violence which they themselves generate. They 
habitually terrorize both their members and their victims, and eliminate 
their rivals. They manipulate the law and, whilst maintaining an 
important facade of respectability, use blackmail and extortion to take 
control of all organizations in the locality. 

Bureaucracy. All totalitarian regimes required a vast army of bureaucrats 
to staff the bloated and duplicated organs of the party-state. This new 
bureaucracy offered rapid advancement to droves of opportunist 
individuals of any social origin. Entirely dependent on the Party, it 
arguably formed the only social constituency whose interests the regime 
had to consider. At the same time, it included a number of competing 
'power centres' whose hidden rivalries gave rise to the only form of 
genuine political life in existence. 

Propaganda. Totalitarian propaganda owed much to the subliminal 
techniques of modern mass advertising. It employed emotive symbols, 
son et lumiere, political art and impressive architecture, and the principle 
of the 'Big Lie'. Its shameless demagoguery was directed at the 
vulnerable and vindictive elements of society uprooted by the tides of 



war and modernization, [propaganda] 

The Aesthetics of Power. Totalitarian regimes enforced a virtual 
monopoly in the arts, propagating an aesthetic environment which 
glorified the ruling Party, embellished the bond between Party and 
people, revelled in heroic images of national myths, and indulged in 
megalomaniac fantasies. Italian Fascists, German Nazis, and Soviet 
Communists all shared a taste for portentous portraits of the Leader, for 
oversized sculptures of musclebound workers, and for ostentatious public 
buildings of ultra-grandiose proportions. 

The dialectical enemy. No totalitarian regime could hope to legitimize its 
own evil designs without an opposite evil to contend with. The rise of 
fascism in Europe was a godsend for the communists, who otherwise 
could only have justified themselves by reference to the more distant 
evils of liberalism, imperialism, and colonialism. The fascists never 
ceased to justify themselves in terms of their crusade against Bolshevism, 
the communists through The struggle against fascism'. The 
contradictions within totalitarianism provided the motor for the hatreds 
and conflicts which it promoted. 

The psychology of hatred. Totalitarian regimes raised the emotional 
temperature by beating the drum of hatred against 'enemies' within and 
without. Honest adversaries or honourable opponents did not exist. In the 
fascist repertoire, Jews and communists headed the bill; in the 
communist repertoire, fascists, capitalist running dogs, 'kulaks', and 
alleged saboteurs were mercilessly pilloried. 

Pre-emptive censorship. Totalitarian ideology could not operate without a 
watertight censorship controlling all sources of information. It was not 
sufficient to suppress unwanted opinions or facts; it was necessary to 
prefabricate all the data that was permitted to circulate. 

Genocide and coercion. Totalitarian regimes pushed political violence 
beyond all previous limits. An elaborate network of political police and 
security agencies was kept busy first in destroying all opponents and 
undesirables and later in inventing opponents to keep the machinery in 
motion. Genocidal campaigns against (innocent) social or racial 
'enemies' added credence to ideological claims and kept the population 
in a permanent state of fear. Mass arrests and shootings, concentration 



camps, and random murders were routine. 

Collectivism. Totalitarian regimes laid stress on all the sorts of activity 
which strengthen collective bonds and weaken family and individual 
identity. State-run nurseries, 'social art', youth movements, party rituals, 
military parades, and group uniforms all served to cement high levels of 
social discipline and conformist behaviour. In Fascist Italy, a system of 
Party-run Corporations was established to replace all former trade union 
and employers' organizations and in 1939 to take over the lower house of 
the national assembly. 

Militarism. Totalitarian regimes habitually magnified the 'external 
threat', or invented it, to rally citizens to the fatherland's defence. 
Rearmament received top economic priority. Under party control, the 
armed forces of the state enjoyed a monopoly of weapons and high social 
prestige. All offensive military plans were described as defensive. 

Universalism. Totalitarian regimes acted on the assumption that their 
system would somehow spread across the globe. Communist ideologues 
held that Marxism-Leninism was 'scientific' and therefore universally 
applicable. The Nazis marched to the refrain 'Denn heute gehort uns 
Deutschland, I Und morgen die ganze Welt' (For today it's Germany 
that's ours, and tomorrow the whole wide world.) [lettland] 

Contempt for liberal democracy. All totalitarian despised liberal 
democracy for its humanitarianism, for its belief in compromise and co¬ 
existence, for its commercialism, and for its attachment to law and 
tradition. 

Moral nihilism. All totalitarian shared the view that their goals justified 
their means. 'Moral Nihilism', wrote one British observer, 'is not only 
the central feature of National Socialism, but also the central feature 
between it and Bolshevism.'- 

The concept of totalitarianism stands or falls on the substance of these points of 
comparison between its principal practitioners. Its validity is not affected by the 
various intellectual and political games for which it has subsequently been used. 

However, communism and fascism obviously differed in the sources of their 
self-identity. Communists were wedded to the class struggle, the Nazis to their 
campaign for racial purity. Important differences also lay in the social and 


economic sphere. The fascists were careful to leave private property intact, and 
to recruit the big industrialists to their cause. The communists abolished most 
aspects of private property. They nationalized industry, collectivized agriculture, 
and instituted central command planning. On these grounds, communism must 
be judged the more totalitarian branch of totalitarianism, [gauche] 

Of course, one has to insist that the Total human control' sometimes claimed 
on behalf of totalitarianism is a figment of someone's imagination. Totalitarian 
utopias and totalitarian realities were two different things. Grand totalitarian 
schemes were often grandly inefficient. Totalitarianism refers not to the 
achievements of regimes but to their ambitions. What is more, the totalitarian 
disease generated its own antibodies. Gross oppression often inspired heroic 
resistance. Exposure to bogus philosophy could sometimes breed people of high 
moral principle. The most determined 'anti-communists' were ex-communists. 
The finest 'anti-Fascists' were sincere German, Italian, or Spanish patriots. 

From the historical point of view, one of the most interesting questions is 
how far communism and fascism fed off each other. Before 1914, the main 
ingredients of the two movements-socialism, Marxism, nationalism, racism, 
and autocracy-were washing around in various combinations all over Europe. 
But communism crystallized first. Its emergence in 1917 occurred well in 
advance of any coherent manifestations of fascism. The communists, therefore, 
must be rated the leaders, and the fascists the quick learners. The point is: can 
chronological precedence be equated with cause and effect? Was fascism simply 
a crusade for saving the world from Bolshevism, as many of its adherents 
maintained? What exactly did the fascists learn from the communists? It is hard 
to deny that Bela Kun gave Horthy's regime its raison d'etre. The Italian general 
strike of October 1922, dominated by communists, gave Mussolini the excuse 
for his 'March on Rome'. It was the strength of the communists in the streets and 
voting booths of Germany which frightened the German conservatives into 
handing power to Hitler. 

But that is hardly the whole story. The fascists, like the communists, were 
notorious fraudsters: one should not take their pronouncements too seriously. 
Benito Mussolini (1883-1945), sometime ex-editor of the socialist newspaper 
Avanti (Forward), author of a pseudo-Marxist work on the class struggle (1912), 
embezzler and street brawler, had little commitment to political principle. He 
had no qualms about using his squads of Fascisti first to help the nationalists' 
brutal seizure of Fiume in 1920, to support Giolitti's liberal bloc in the general 



election of 1921, and later to murder the Socialist leader, Matteotti. He declared 
himself in favour of constitutional monarchy, for example, shortly before 
overthrowing it. One need not search for ideological consistency in such tactics: 
he was simply seeking to exploit the mayhem which he had helped to unleash. 

The same must be said of Mussolini's extraordinary, and extraordinarily 
successful, behaviour in October 1922. Having first contributed to the chaos 
which produced the general strike, he then cabled the King with an ultimatum 
demanding to be made Prime Minister. The King should have ignored the cable; 
but he didn't. Mussolini did not seize power; he merely threatened to do so, and 
under the threat of further chaos Italy's democrats surrendered. 'The "March on 
Rome'", writes the leading historian of Italy, 'was a comfortable train ride, 
followed by a petty demonstration, and all in response to an express invitation 
from the monarch.'- Years later, when Mussolini's regime was in dire trouble, 
Adolf Hitler insisted on saving him. 'After all,' the Fiihrer was reported as 
saying, 'it was the Duce who showed us that everything was possible.'- What 
Mussolini showed to be possible was the subversion of liberal democracy, and a 
second terrible round of Europe's 'total war'. 

The tone of international relations was set by the almost universal abhorrence of 
war. On the surface at least, 'non-aggression' was obligatory. In twenty years, a 
large number of non-aggression pacts were signed (see Appendix III, p. 1322). 
For those states who intended no aggression, such pacts were irrelevant. For 
those intending aggression they provided excellent cover: both Hitler and Stalin 
were fond of them. 

The creation of the League of Nations must be counted among the 
achievements of the Peace Conference. The Covenant of the League came into 
force on 10 January 1920, the same day as the Treaty of Versailles, into which it 
had been incongruously incorporated. It sought to provide for the settlement of 
disputes by arbitration and consent, and for the use of collective force against 
aggressors. It envisaged an annual General Assembly, where each member state 
had an equal vote, an executive Council, and a permanent Secretariat, all based 
in Geneva. The League also took over the International Court of Justice at The 
Hague, and the International Chamber of Labour. The General Assembly first 
convened in November 1920, and met every year thereafter until 1941. It 
dissolved itself in April 1946, when the residual operations were transferred to 
the United Nations Organization in New York. 


The work of the League started too late to affect the immediate settlement of 
the Great War, and was hobbled by the non-participation of the powers who 
might have rendered it effective. At no time in the 21 years of its operation were 
all three of Europe's power centres properly represented. Of the Western Powers, 
France alone played a full part. The USA, the League's original sponsor, stayed 
away, and Great Britain failed to sign the fundamental Geneva Protocol (1924) 
on the pacific settlement of disputes. Germany only participated from 1926 to 
1933, Italy from 1920 to 1937. The Soviet Union was admitted in 1934, and 
expelled in 1940. An important initiative was taken by France and the USA in 
1928 to plug some of the League's obvious failings. The Briand-Kellogg pact for 
the renunciation of war was eventually signed by 64 states, including the USSR. 
But it was never incorporated into the League's own rules. Hence, whilst the 
League advocated military or economic sanctions against aggressor states, it did 
not possess the means to enforce its own sanctions. As a result, it played a major 
role in the management of minor issues and a negligible role in the management 
of major ones. 

Thanks to the ambivalent attitudes of the Western Powers, the League was 
not empowered to challenge the general European Settlement which the former 
thought they had put into place in 1919-20. A fatal ruling determined that 
demands for Treaty revision could not be accepted as a 'dispute' under the terms 
of the Geneva Protocol. The principle of unanimity, which governed voting in 
the Assembly and the Council, ensured that no decision could ever be taken 
contrary to the wishes of the Powers. The crucial Disarmament Conference did 
not meet until 1932, by which time rearmament was well advanced in the USSR 
and was soon to be launched in Germany. 

Overall, therefore, the sponsors of the League deprived it of the means to 
observe its high ideals. It ran the colonial Mandates Commission for Palestine 
and Syria. It administered the Free City of Danzig, the Saarland, and the Straits 
Commission. It mediated between Turkey and Iraq over Mosul, between Greece 
and Bulgaria over Macedonia (1925), and, unsuccessfully, between Poland and 
Lithuania over Wilno (1925-7). It could not cope with the Japanese invasion of 
Manchuria (1931) or the Italian invasion of Abyssinia (1936). Through no fault 
of its own, it was completely out of its depth when the major powers of Europe 
began to unsheath their claws in the late 1930s. 

The most active statesman in the field of European peace and co-operation 
was undoubtedly Aristide Briand (1862-1932). A reforming socialist born at 



Nantes, Briand had been ten times France's Premier; but the most expansive 
phase of his career was reached in 1925-32, when he served as Foreign Minister. 
He was specially energetic in the pursuit of Franco-German reconciliation. He 
was the chief architect of the Locarno Pact; he forged the Kellogg-Briand pact 
for the renunciation of war; and he made proposals for European union. His 
noble ideals, and their lack of success, were typical of the times. 

Briand's proposals for European union had few immediate consequences. 
But they are important for all who seek the seeds of policies which eventually 
bore fruit twenty years later. They were first raised in a speech to the Assembly 
of the League on 5 September 1929: 

'I think that among peoples constituting geographical groups, like the peoples of Europe, there should be 
some kind of federal bond... Obviously, this association will be primarily economie, for that is the most 
urgent aspect of the question ... Still, I am convinced that this federal link might also do useful work 
politically and socially, and without affecting the sovereignty of any of the nations belonging to the 
association 


The key phrases were 'geographical groups', 'primarily economic', and 
'sovereignty'. 

A more detailed Memorandum was presented in May 1930. This document 
spoke of 'the moral union of Europe', and outlined the principles and mechanics 
whereby it might be achieved. It insisted on 'the general subordination of the 
economic problem to the political one'. It envisaged a Permanent Political 
Committee for executive decisions, and a representative body, the European 
Conference, for debate. In the immediate term, it called on the 27 European 
members of the League to convene a series of meetings to study a wide range of 
related issues, including finance, labour, and inter-parliamentary relations. From 
January 1931, Briand chaired a subcommittee of the League which examined 
members' responses to the Memorandum. Of these, only the Dutch reply was 
prepared to accept that European union involved an inevitable reduction of 
sovereignty. 

As it proved, 1931 was the terminal year both for Briand and for his ideas. 
His initial speech on European union had been closely followed by the Wall 
Street crash. Discussions on his Memorandum coincided with the first electoral 
success of the German Nazis. Briand's European schemes were overtaken by his 
chairmanship of the Manchurian Committee, which, after much deliberation, 
issued a verbal reprimand to Japan for the invasion of China. In Asia, Japan 
flouted the League and reaped the rewards of aggression. In Europe, 'the spirit 


of Locarno' was sick. Stresemann was dead; Briand himself ailed, and resigned. 
Briand's death elicited an impassioned tribute from Britain's Foreign Secretary, 
Austen Chamberlain. Briand 'was proud of his country, and jealous of her 
prerogatives,' he said. 'But his pride was only content when France stepped out 
like a goddess, leading the other nations in the paths of peace and civilisation. 
There is no-one of his stature left.'- It was a rare demonstration of Anglo- 
French solidarity. 

In this atmosphere, an alternative plan for European security was advanced 
by Fascist Italy. Mussolini proposed a four-power pact of Britain, France, 
Germany, and Italy. It represented a cynical return to the bad habits of the 
Concert of Europe, and would have dropped all pretence about the equal 
standing of states. It unashamedly attempted to mobilize the 'West' against the 
dangers of the 'East'-that is, against the squabbles of the successor states, and 
the potential expansion of communism. It found a measure of favour in the 
British Foreign Office; but it did not appeal to the Quai d'Orsay, which preferred 
to stick to existing arrangements. Apart from the Munich Conference, its 
provisions remained a dead letter. 

Europe's cultural life was deeply affected by the hangovers of war, which 
heightened the questioning of traditional values and accelerated existing 
centrifugal trends. The tone of anxiety and pessimism was set by Oswald 
Spengler's Der Untergang des Abendlandes (The Decline of the West, 1918), a 
specifically German view of'Western civilization'. The advent of communism 
excited many Western intellectuals, for whom the defiant Utopian stance of the 
Bolsheviks in Russia proved unusually fascinating. Active communist politics 
was for the few; but marxisant opinions were much in fashion. The long stream 
of Moscow-bound pilgrims, for whom the most murderous regime in European 
history could do no wrong, offers one of the stranger spectacles of mass delusion 
on record."- Fascism, too, was to recruit its academic and cultural collaborators. 
Some individuals, such as G. B. Shaw, managed to fawn on dictators of all hues. 
Visiting the USSR in 1931, he remarked: 'I wish we had forced labour in 
England, in which case we would not have two million unemployed.' His 
opinion of Stalin after a personal meeting was: 'he is said to be a model of 
domesticity, virtue and innocence'.- In retrospect, books such as the Webbs' 
Soviet Communism: A New Civilisation (1935) look simply fatuous; but they 
pandered to the genuine anxieties of the post-war generation whilst serving to 


hold the world in ignorance about Soviet realities. The lack of moral integrity 
among politically pressured intellectuals, as described in Julien Benda's La 
Trahison des clercs (1927), was a recurring theme. It would have been more 
convincing if Benda himself had not tried to justify Stalin's show trials. The 
Spanish social philosopher Jose Ortega y Gasset saw totalitarianism as a sign of 
the threat from mass culture. In his Rebelion de las Masas (Revolt of the Masses, 
1930), he warned that democracy carried the seeds of tyranny by the majority. 

In religious thought, the conservative Catholic hierarchy took a stronger line 
against communism than did the Protestant churches. But in 1937 Pius XI's twin 
encyclicals, Mit brennender Sorge and Divini Redemptoris, ruled that both 
Nazism and communism were incompatible with Christianity. At the same time, 
modernist Catholic philosophers such as the neo-Thomist Jacques Maritain 
(1882-1973) sought to update the Church's social thought. Interdenominational 
religious debate was stimulated by the Jewish theologian Martin Buber (1875- 
1965), sometime Professor at Frankfurt, and by the Swiss, Karl Barth (1886- 
1968), whose influential Die kirchliche Dogmatik (1932) sought to reinstate 
Protestant fundamentals. 

In literature, the post-war sense of devastation and disorientation was 
eloquently conveyed in T. S. Eliot's marvellous Waste Land, in Pirandello's play 
Six Characters in Search of an Author (1920), and in the 'stream of 
consciousness' texts of James Joyce's novels Ulysses (1923) and Finnegans 
Wake (1939). The year 1928 marked the creation both of D. H. Lawrence's 
unpublishable Lady Chatterley's Lover, a bold attack on English sexual mores, 
and of Berthold Brecht's Dreigroschenoper (Threepenny Opera), the best-known 
product of a politically left-wing and unconventional artistic milieu in pre-Nazi 
Berlin. In that same era the novelist Thomas Mann (1875-1955), who had made 
his name before the war with Buddenbrooks (1900) and Death in Venice (1911), 
took the lead in protecting German culture from the ill repute of German politics. 
He published more novels, such as Der Zauberberg (The Magic Mountain, 
1924), which explored the dubious legacy of Wagner and Nietzsche, before 
emigrating and becoming the epitome of 'the good German' in exile. In Russia, a 
brief interval of literary freedom in the 1920s gave space to the powerful talents 
of the revolutionary poets Alexander Blok (1880-1921) and Vladimir 
Mayakovsky (1893-1930). The advent of Stalinism divided Soviet writers into 
servants of the Party, such as Gorky and Sholokov, and persecuted dissidents, 
such as Osip Mandel'shtam (1891-1938) or Anna Akhmatova (1889-1966). The 
memoirs of Mandel'shtam's widow, Nadzezhda, Hope Against Hope, could not 



be published until the 1960s; but they provide the most eloquent testimony to 
Russian culture in the catacombs. In Central Europe, premonitions of 
totalitarianism hang over Kafka's The Castle (1925) and The Trial (1926), over 
Karel Capek's allegorical drama The Insect Play (1921), over Witkiewicz's 
novel Insatiability, as in the work of the Romanian Lucian Blaga (1895-1961) 
and the Croat Miroslav Krleza (1893-1975). Kafka's anti-hero 'K', who is 
arrested on charges which he can never discover, is eventually killed by two men 
in opera-hats to the words 'Like a dog'. Stanisiaw Witkiewicz (1885-1939), 
known as 'Witkacy', painter and mathematician as well as writer, is now 
acknowledged as the pioneer of the Theatre of the Absurd. Barely known in his 
lifetime outside Poland, he was destined to commit suicide on the day the Red 
Army joined in the invasion of the Nazi Wehrmacht. Nothing gained such 
popular acclaim, however, as the memoirs of a Swedish doctor on Capri, Axel 
Munthe, whose Story of San Michele (1929) was translated into forty-one 
languages, [index] [waste land] 

In the social sciences, the so-called 'Lrankfurt School' exerted a huge 
influence in a very short time. Opened in 1923 and closed by the Nazis in 1934, 
the Institut fur Sozialforschung at Lrankfurt sheltered a circle of intellectuals 
working at the interface of philosophy, psychology, and sociology. Ligures such 
as Max Horkenheimer (1895-1973), Theodor Adorno (1903-69), and Karl 
Mannheim (1893-1947) felt that modern science had yet to find effective 
methods for analysing human affairs and assisting their progress. Radical and 
left-wing, but opposed to ah ideologies, including Marxism, they rejected 
conventional logic and epistemology, whilst fearing the evils of technology, 
industrial society, and piecemeal reform. Their search for a free-floating 'critical 
theory', conditioned but not determined by the times, was to impress a whole 
generation of social scientists both in the USA and in post-1945 Europe. The 
best-known fruit of their general research was the joint work by Horkheimer and 
Adorno, Die Dialektik der Aufkldrung (The Dialectic of the Enlightenment, 
1947).- [annales] 

In art, traditionalist styles continued to disintegrate. After Symbolism, 
Cubism, and Expressionism came Primitivism, Dadaism, Suprematism, 
Abstractionism, Surrealism, and Constructivism. The leading experimenters 
included the Russian exile Vasily Kandinsky (1866-1944), a Jewish exile, Marc 
Chagall (1889-1985), the left-wing Catalan exile Pablo Picasso (1881-1973), 
the Italian exile Amedeo Modigliani (1884-1920), the Swiss Paul Klee (1879- 
1940), the Austrian Oskar Kokoschka (1886-1980), the Frenchman Jean Arp 


(1887-1966), and the Spaniard Salvador Dali (1904-89). France was their 
Mecca. Their eclectic inventiveness matched their longevity. Klee painted 
abstractions in pure colour; Dali painted disturbing Freudian dreamscapes; Arp 
dropped pieces of paper onto the floor. 


WASTE LAND 

T. s. eliot'S The Waste Land appeared in 1922, the work of an American 
who had settled in Europe. The original draft began: 'First we had a couple 
of feelers down at Tom's place.' The published version began: 

April is the cruellest month, breeding 
Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing 
Memory and desire, stirring 
Dull roots with spring rain. 

Eliot's 433-line poem, largely written in Switzerland, was inspired by the 
legend of the Holy Grail, and was composed from a string of arcane literary 
allusions and fragments. The overall effect resembled a ramble through the 
relics of a shattered civilization. 

The final section deals, among other things, with the decay of Eastern 
Europe: 

Who are those hooded hordes swarming 
Over endless plains, stumbling in cracked earth 
Ringed by the flat horizon ... 

A note refers to a quotation from the Swiss novelist Hermann Hesse: 
'Beautiful at least is that eastern half of Europe which is travelling drunk 
after the Holy Grail on the road to Chaos, singing like Dmitri Karamazov.' 

The poem concludes: 

London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling 
down. 

Poi s'ascose nel foco che gli affina 

Quando flam ceu chelidon. -O swallow, swallow 

Le Prince d 'Aquitaine a la tour abolie. 




These fragments I have shored against my mins 
Why then lie fit you. Hieronymo's mad againe. 

Datta. Dayadhvam. Damyata. 

Shantih shantih shantih 

'Various critics', Eliot explained later at a Harvard lecture, 'have done me 
the honour to interpret the poem in terms of criticism of the contemporary 
world ... To me ... it was just a piece of rhythmic grumbling.' 1 


ANNALES 

Volume 1 , number 1 of the journal Annales d'histoire economique et 

sociale was dated Paris, 15 January 1929. 1 A short preface 'To our readers' 
was signed by the two directors, Lucien Febvre (1878-1956) and Marc 
Bloch (1886-1944). It expressed the belief that the new review would 'make 
its mark in the sun'. Four main articles were published: Gustave Glotz on the 
price of papyrus in Greek antiquity; Henri Pirenne on the education of 
medieval merchants; M. Baumont on German industrial activity since the 
last war; and G. Mequet (Geneva) on the population problem in the USSR. A 
second section on 'Scientific Life' contained various news items, together 
with a technical description of plans parcelaires, or 'sketch-plans of landed 
property', by Bloch and an outline of the career of Max Weber by Maurice 
Halbwachs. A review section carried a dozen essays covering topics varying 
from Sicilian slavery to Welsh economic history. The back cover carried 
advertisements for the 'Collection Armand Colin', the journal's principal 
sponsor, and for the 22-volume Geographie universelle of Paul Vidal de la 
Blache and L. Gallois. 

Annales was to launch not just a journal but a school of history of 
unrivalled authority. Its aims were to break the dominance of established 
fields, and to broaden historical studies by techniques and topics drawn from 
the social sciences. Not just economics and sociology, but psychology, 
demography, statistics, geography, climatology, anthropology, linguistics, 
and medical science were all to have their place. Special emphasis was to be 




laid on the interdisciplinary approach. 2 

The intellectual pedigree of Annales is revealing. Febvre met Bloch at 
the University of Strasbourg. He had made his name through a regional 
study of the Franche-Comte. Bloch was working on French rural history. 
Neither felt attracted to the historical stars of the day such as Renouvin, the 
diplomatic historian, or Fustel de Coulanges, the apostle of documentary 
research. Both had come under the influence of very different masters. One 
of these was Emile Durkheim (d. 1917), pioneer sociologist. The second was 
the Belgian, Henri Pirenne (1862-1935), author of problem-centred studies 
on medieval democracy and The social history of capitalism'. The third was 
Paul Vidal de la Blache (1845-1918), professor at the Ecole Normale 
Superieure and the founder of human geography. It was Vidal who had 
inspired Febvre and Bloch to go out into the countryside in search of new 
sources and perspectives on the past. 3 

Most revealing, perhaps, was the professional sin against which the 
original directors of Annales were preparing to do battle. It was the sin of 
specialization. Historians were concentrating their efforts ever more 
narrowly behind their own cloisonnements or 'dividing walls'. The appeal 
was unambiguous: 

'Nothing would be better if all legitimate specialists, whilst carefully tending 
their own gardens, would take the trouble none the less to study the work of 
their neighbours. Yet the walls are so high that very often the view is 
blocked. It is against these formidable divisions that we see ourselves taking 
our stand.' 4 

If the menace was recognizable in 1929, it was to grow inexorably in the 
decades which followed. 


In music, the neo-Romantic and Modernist styles launched before the war 
both found new advocates in the Russians Stravinsky, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, 
and Rachmaninov, in the Pole Karol Szymanowski (1882-1937), and the 
Hungarian Bela Bartok (1881-1945). The prominence of East Europeans, both 
as composers and as instrumentalists, emphasized the cultural bonds which 
overarched the growing political divide, [strad] The German Carl Orff (1895- 




1982) distinguished himself both in composition and in the realm of musical 
education. His popular secular oratorio, Carmina Burana (1937), set medieval 
poems to strong, deliberately primitive rhythms, [tone] 

In architecture and design, the German Bauhaus was founded at Weimar by 
Walter Gropius (1883-1969) and closed down by the Nazis. It drew its 
inspiration from Expressionism and Constructionism in turns, and pioneered 
functional methods. Its stars included Itten, Moholy-Nagy, Kandinsky, and Klee. 

Except in music, where international barriers were most permeable, the East 
European contribution to the cultural avant-garde remained long and widely 
unrecognized. A number of groups or individuals gained renown either through 
migrating to the West, like the Romanian sculptor, Constantin Brancusi (1876- 
1957), or through state-sponsored Soviet exhibitions in the 1920s which brought 
attention to figures such as Kazimierz Malewicz (1878-1935), Pavel Filonov 
(1882-1946), Vladimir Tatlin (1885-1953), or Alexander Rodchenko (1891- 
1956). Naturally, the full acceptance of the avant-garde proceeded slowly 
everywhere. But in Eastern Europe the advent of fascism and the still longer 
reign of communism drove non-conformist culture into the shadows for half a 
century. The 'Osma Group' of early Czech Cubists, for example, centred on 
painters such as Antonin Prochazka (1882-1945) or Bohumil Kubista (1884- 
1918), was known only to the most specialized experts. The importance of the 
pioneer Lithuanian symbolist Mikalojus Ciurlionis (1875-1911) or of 
Wladyslaw Strzemihski (1893-1952), theorist and practitioner of 
Constructivism, or the strength of the Jewish presence, was not revealed until 
exhibitions planned in the 1990s.- The cultural unity of a politically divided 
Europe was much deeper than was realized at the time. 


TONE 

In 1923 Arnold Schoenberg completed his Serenade. It was the first piece 
composed entirely by the rules of dodecaphony or 'twelve-tone serialisin'. 
Dodecaphony was the chosen medium of the pioneering school of atonal 
music. 1 

Ever since the Middle Ages, the twelve keys, in major or minor mode, 
had formed a fundamental element of European musical grammar; and the 





eight-note octave of each key presented composers with the pool of notes 
from which to build their melodies, chords, and harmonies. In dodecaphony, 
in contrast, the traditional keys and octaves were abandoned in favour of a 
basic set or 'row' of notes using all points of the twelve-point chromatic 
scale. Each set could begin at any pitch on any point in the scale, and could 
be arranged in inversions and regressions, giving 48 possible patterns to 
every series. The resultant music was filled with previously unknown 
intervals and combinations of notes and was, to the unaccustomed ear, 
excruciatingly discordant. It represented a break with the past as radical as 
abstract, non-representational art, or non-grammatical 'stream-of- 
consciousness' prose. Its principal practitioners after Schoenberg were Berg, 
Webern, Dallapiccola, Lutyens, and Stravinsky. 

Atonality, however, was not the only way of deconstructing musical 
form. The Parisian 'Six', who took Erik Satie (1866-1925) as their master, 
and who included Artur Honegger (1892-1955), Darius Milhaud (1892- 
1974), and Francis Poulenc (1899-1963), experimented with poly-tonality, 
that is, using two or more keys simultaneously. Paul Hindemith (1895-1963) 
extended tonal harmony by exploiting harmonic series. Olivier Messiaen 
(1898-1993), organist of St Sulpice, developed complex rhythms inspired by 
oriental music, melodies based on bird-song, and musical tones matched to 
visual colours. Henryk Gorecki (b. 1933) sought inspiration in medieval 
harmonies and in free time. Harrison Birtwhistle (b. 1934) turned 
Renaissance monody to new uses. Anthony Burgess (1917-93) wrote 'post- 
tonaP music alongside criticism and fiction. 2 

Both Messiaen and Gorecki were Catholic believers, seeking modernist 
methods to recapture old effects. The former's Quattuor pour la fin du temps 
(1941), written during wartime imprisonment in Silesia, and the latter's 
phenomenally popular Symphony No. 3 (1976), also motivated by wartime 
experiences in Silesia, reflect a special sensitivity to time and mood. They 
appealed to a wider musical audience than the cerebral dode-caphonists ever 
could. 3 


Nevertheless, the growing prominence of Modernism should not conceal the 
fact that the strongest influences on inter-war European culture came from two 
other directions-from technological change and from America. The impact on 




popular consciousness of radio, of the Kodak camera, of affordable 
gramophones, and above all of the cinema was immense. Thanks to Hollywood, 
Charles Chaplin (1889-1977), an orphaned entertainer from London's East End, 
probably became the best-known person in the world. Many of his films, such as 
City Lights (1931), Modern Times (1935), or The Dictator (1939), contained 
clear social and political messages. Other Europeans re-exported by the silver 
screen included the Swede Greta Garbo, the German Marlene Dietrich, and the 
Pole, Pola Negri. American imports of the era included popular motoring, Walt 
Disney's animated cartoons (1928), jazz, and popular dance music. Much of 
young Europe danced its way from war to war to the strains of ragtime, the 
Charleston, and the tango. 

In the socio-economic sphere the modernization of European society surged 
ahead, but in highly irregular patterns. The demands of the war had given a 
strong stimulus to heavy industry and to a wide range of technological 
innovation. Yet the peace began amidst the widespread disruption of markets, 
trade, and credit. Despite the great potential for development, especially in new 
sectors such as oil and motorization, the industrialized countries faced the threat 
of post-war recession and mass unemployment, and of accompanying social 
protest. 

The struggle for women's rights was barely started, let alone won. In Great 
Britain, for example, Constance Gore-Booth (Countess Markiewicz, 1868- 
1927), who had once been condemned to death for her part in the Easter Rising, 
had the distinction of being both the first female British MP elected and the first 
female Irish Cabinet Minister.- But the movement for women's suffrage, which 
had been founded during the childhood of its most devoted activist, Emmeline 
Pankhurst (1858-1928), did not achieve success in Britain until the year of her 
death. The pioneer of birth control, Marie Stopes (1880-1958), who opened the 
UK's first birth-control clinic in 1921, was also a professional palaeontologist 
employed by Manchester University, [condom] 

The peasant societies of Eastern Europe were faced by the problems of rural 
overpopulation, by dwindling opportunities for migration, by a drastic fall in 
agricultural prices, and by the dearth of capital investment, both local and 
foreign. In all these matters the economic paralysis of Germany and the 
unnatural isolation of the Soviet Union caused untold disruption beyond their 
borders. No sooner had a measure of stability been restored than the whole of 


Europe was hit by the Great Depression. 

The countries of East Central Europe, trapped between Germany and the 
USSR, faced very special difficulties. Whilst struggling to establish stable 
political regimes, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and the Baltic States were 
forced to carry the economic consequences of the collapse of the empires. Semi- 
industrialized but still largely agrarian in character, their infant economies started 
life under the multiple burdens of hyperinflation, post-war industrial recession, 
and rural distress. Lodz, for example, the largest textile city in the region, 
suffered a 75 per cent drop in production between 1918 and 1939, when its 
traditional Russian market was closed. Peasant societies were increasingly 
polarized by conflicts between conservative landowning interests and radical 
peasant parties, by the impositions of new government bureaucracies and 
foreign-based enterprises, and by class and ethnic protests. In this light, the great 
advances made in education and the elimination of illiteracy, in parcelling out of 
the large estates, and in urban development command much respect-not least 
because later regimes were to deny that any such progress had been made. 

The greatest ever experiment in planned modernization took place from 1929 
onwards in the Soviet Union. It was so radical and so ruthless that many analysts 
would maintain that this, and not the events of 1917, constitute the real Russian 
Revolution.- It was made possible by the rise to supreme power of Joseph 
Stalin, General Secretary of the CPSU since 1922. 

Iosif Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili (1879-1953), alias 'Koba', alias 'Stalin', 
is the clearest example in history of a pathological criminal who rose to supreme 
power through the exercise of his criminal talents. In The Guinness Book of 
Records he holds the top place under 'mass murder'. He was born in the 
mountain village of Didi-lilo, near Gori in Georgia, the son of a drunken father 
and of a devout, abandoned mother. Georgians say that he was an Ossetian. At 
all events, he was not a Russian, though he was sent to be educated in a Russian 
Orthodox seminary. He was expelled, but not before he had imbibed the 
paranoiac nationalism of a Russian Church which, in Georgia, was an alien 
creed. He drifted into revolutionary politics, in the seedy area where the political 
and the criminal undergrounds overlapped. He made his name in the Bolshevik 
Party in 1908, when he staged the most spectacular armed robbery in tsarist 
history, ambushing the Tiflis mail-coach and leaving the scene with a haul of 
gold. He was repeatedly arrested and exiled to Siberia, whence he repeatedly 


escaped. This circumstance created the suspicion, first voiced by Trotsky, his 
most jaundiced biographer, that he was an agent of the Tsarist secret police, the 
Okhrana. He arrived in Petrograd early in 1917 after the latest of his escapes, 
and, with no qualifications in journalism or Marxism, assumed the editorship of 
Pravda. In the revolutionary years he was Lenin's choice as Commissar for the 
Nationalities, and built up a circle of loyal accomplices, notably at Tsaritsyn 
(later renamed Stalingrad), who followed his fortunes thereafter. His most 
dangerous moment came in Poland in August 1920 when, as political 
commander of the South-west Front he had ignored orders to link up with 
Tukhachevsky and was held responsible by a Party tribunal for the ensuing 
disaster. As usual, he could not be nailed; but he never forgot it. (Seventeen 
years later, the death warrant of Tukhachevsky and of four other associates from 
1920 was signed by three generals who had all served on Stalin's Southwest 
front.) 

Stalin became General Secretary of the Party during Lenin's first illness, and 
he survived Lenin's belated advice to have him removed. According to Trotsky, 
he poisoned Lenin to prevent further enquiries. Thereafter, with the Cheka and 
the Party Congresses in his practised hands, there was no stopping him. He 
proceeded with a masterful display of cunning and cynicism. He outmanoeuvred 
all his senior rivals, setting them up on policy issues which he coolly adopted for 
himself or used to discredit them. It took him five years to ruin Kamenev, 
Zinoviev, and Bukharin, and seven to ruin Trotsky. He then set about killing 
them. He had no family life. He drove his second wife to suicide. He lived like a 
hermit in one room of the Kremlin, attended by his daughter, Svetlana 
Alliluyeva, whose memoirs are a prime source. He slept all day and worked all 
night with his cronies, endlessly playing the gramophone and watching silent 
movies, and visiting his dacha for relaxation. He rarely emerged, and made few 
speeches. On his annual trip to Georgia he travelled in one of five identical 
trains, each of the others carrying a 'double' to lessen the risk of assassination. 
He need not have bothered. He lived out his natural term. Later, though he spoke 
no foreign language except Russian, he proved himself as skilful in diplomacy as 
in home tyranny and in war management. When he was finally struck down, he 
was the unchallenged master of a superpower. 

In looking for superlatives to describe Stalin's chief rival, an American 
officer in Petrograd had once called Trotsky 'A four-kind son-of-a-bitch, but the 
greatest Jew since Jesus Christ'.- Yet Stalin's record was to make Trotsky's 
achievements look like the small change of history. And Trotsky saw it coming: 


already in 1924 he was correctly predicting that 'the gravedigger of the Party of 
the Revolution' would take over: 


The dialectics of history have already hooked him and will raise him up. He is needed by all of them, by the 
tired radicals, by the bureaucrats, by the nepmen, by the kulaks, by the upstarts, by all the sneaks that are 
crawling out of the upturned soil of the revolution ... He speaks their language, and knows how to lead 
them. Stalin will become the dictator of the USSR.- 


As a manipulator of political power, Stalin has every claim to be judged the 
greatest man of the twentieth century. He once said, modestly, 'Leaders come 
and go, but the People remain.'- In fact, under his guidance the people had to 
come and go and the Leader remained. The only person whose evil can be 
compared to his own was another small man with a different moustache, whom 
he never met, and who was not so successful. 

Once Stalin was firmly in the saddle, the tempo of Soviet life began to whir. 
Lenin's NEP had done much to restore social and economic equilibrium; but it 
did nothing to further communist ideals or to equip the Soviet Union for modern 
warfare. So, confident in his command of unlimited coercion, Stalin plunged into 
a breakneck programme which was designed to forge a first-class industrial and 
military power within a decade. Its ambitions were breathtaking; yet in terms of 
human life its destructiveness outdid any other disaster in European history, even 
the Second World War. Its apologists, who still thrive in distant universities, are 
apt to maintain that 'omelettes can't be made without breaking eggs'.- But 
Stalin was breaking the people whose lives he was supposedly improving; and in 
the end the omelette proved inedible. There were six main interlocking elements: 
central planning, accelerated industrialization, rearmament, collectivized 
agriculture, ideological warfare, and political terror. 

Stalinist planning methods exceeded anything previously attempted 
anywhere. The State Planning Commission, Gosplan, was empowered to draw 
up Five-Year Plans that determined every detail of every branch of economic 
activity-production, trade, services, prices, wages, costs. Every enterprise, and 
every worker, was given 'norms' that were to be fulfilled without discussion. 
Since the Soviet state was a monopoly employer, all workers became 'slaves of 
the Plan'. Indeed, since the Party insisted on the ethos of 'socialist emulation', 
that is, forcing workers to outdo their norms in the manner of the legendary 
coalminer Alexei Stakhanov, over-fulfilment of the Plan was regularly 
demanded. The Five-Year Plans of 1928-32, 1933-7, and 1938-42 set 
unprecedented targets for economic growth and productivity of labour. 


Industrialization was to be achieved in exchange for a marked reduction in 
consumption. In practice, this meant 'work harder, eat less'. Industrial growth 
rates were set at over 20 per cent per annum. Total crude industrial output rose 
astronomically: in 1928 the index stood at 111 per cent of the 1913 level, in 1933 
at 281 per cent, in 1938 at 658 per cent. Absolute priority was given to heavy 
industry-steel, coal, power, and chemicals. Quantity reigned supreme over 
quality. Falsified statistics became the object of an official cult whose central 
temple stood in the Permanent Exhibition of Economic Achievement in Moscow. 

Rearmament was not announced, though the military-industrial complex was 
evidently the chief beneficiary of the changes. A separate and secret military- 
industrial sector was supplied with its own favoured factories, personnel, and 
budget. (The very existence of that separate budget was denied until 1989.) From 
1932 onwards the Red Army was able to invite its German partners to participate 
in training and manoeuvres using the most modern equipment, including tanks, 
war-planes, and parachute troops. 

The collectivization of agriculture, postponed in 1917, was now put into 
effect with utter disregard for the human cost. The aim was to ensure that the 
state took full control of the food supply at a period when a large part of the rural 
labour force was being drafted into the new industrial towns. In the ten years 
1929-38,94 per cent of the Soviet Union's 26 million peasant holdings were 
amalgamated into a quarter of a million kolkhozy or state-owned 'collective 
farms'. After 70 years of emancipation, the Russian peasant was returned to 
serfdom at the point of a gun. All who resisted were shot or deported. A fictional 
social enemy, the kulak or tight-fisted peasant, was invented in order to justify 
the murders. An estimated 15 million men, women, and children died. 
Agricultural production dropped by 30 per cent. Famine, both natural and 
artificial, stalked the land. 

Stalinist ideology, as instituted in the 1930s, involved the adoption of 
numerous official fictions which were then enforced as the absolute and 
incontrovertible truth. These fictions had little to do with serious political 
philosophy, and took a radical turn away from Lenin's internationalist Marxism. 
They included: the role of Stalin as 'the best disciple' of Lenin; the role of 
communists as the chosen leaders of the people; the role of the Great Russians as 
'elder brothers' of the Soviet nationalities; the status of the Soviet Union as the 
crowning achievement of 'all patriotic and progressive forces'; the function of 
the Constitution as a source of democratic power; the unity of the Soviet people 



and their love for the communist system; the 'capitalist encirclement' of the 
USSR; the equitable distribution of wealth; the joyous freedom of learning and 
art; the emancipation of women; the solidarity of workers and peasants; the 
justness of 'the people's wrath' against their enemies. Many of these fictions 
were enshrined in Stalin's Short Course (1939) on the history of the Communist 
Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), the bible of the faithful. Soviet scholars, 
educators, and legislators were obliged to propagate them for fear of their lives; 
Western scholars were not. 

The cult of Stalin's personality knew no bounds. All the country's foremost 
poets and artists were conscripted to the chorus: 

Thou, bright sun of the nations, 

The unsinking sun of our times, 

And more than the Sun, 

For the Sun has no wisdom .. .- 

In religious matters, Stalinism followed the established atheist line. State 
education was militantly anti-religious. In the 1920s and 30s the Orthodox 
Church was mercilessly attacked, churches destroyed, and priests killed. Later, 
the emphasis shifted more towards manipulation: during the Second World War, 
Stalin would call for the defence of Holy Russia and reopen the churches. 
Mature Stalinism contained a strange symbiosis of state atheism and Orthodox 
patriotism. 

The main instruments of coercion and terror-the Cheka (OGPU/NKVD/ 
KGB), the Gulag, or network of state concentration camps, and the dependent 
judiciary-had been refined during the early Bolshevik period. In the 1930s they 
were expanded to the point where the manpower of the security agencies rivalled 
that of the Red Army, and the camps contained up to 10 per cent of the 
population. By 1939 the Gulag was the largest employer in Europe. Its prisoner- 
employees, the zeks, who were systematically starved and overworked in arctic 
conditions, had an average life expectancy of one winter. Innocent victims were 
rounded up in their homes and villages; others were charged with imaginary 
offences of 'sabotage', 'treason', or 'espionage', and tortured into confession. 
The usual sentences consisted either of summary execution or of fixed periods of 
imprisonment or exile, such as 8, 12, or 25 years, from which very few could 
emerge alive. Show trials of the most prominent victims were staged for the 
benefit of publicity. They also served to mask the nature and scale of the main 


operations. Such was the paralysing fear that gripped the largest state in the 
world for three decades that most of the concrete information about the Terror 
was successfully suppressed. [Vorkuta] 


VORKUTA 

If space in history books were allotted in proportion to human suffering, 
then Vorkuta would warrant one of the longest chapters. From 1932 until 
1957, this mining town on the Pechora River, in Russia's Arctic, stood at the 
centre of Europe's most extensive complex of concentration camps. In 
Stalin's 'Gulag Archipelago', the Vorkutlag ranked second only to Kolyma 
in north-eastern Siberia, whose entrance gates were surmounted by the 
slogan: 'LABOUR IS A MATTER OF HONOUR, COURAGE, AND 
HEROISM.' At the time of the zek rebellion in 1953, Vorkuta held some 
300,000 souls. Over the years, more human beings perished there than at 
[auschwitz]; and they died slowly, in despair. But few history books 
remember them. 1 There are many eye-witness reports from Vorkuta, several 
of them published in English; 2 but few people have read them. There is even 
a detailed guidebook to over 2,000 'facilities' of the Soviet Gulag written by 
a Jewish survivor in the 1970s. His account was barely noticed. 3 In addition 
to the familiar categories of camps, prisons, and psikbol'nitsa or 'psychiatric 
prisons' [deviatio], it contains a section on 'death-camps'. These were 
installations like those at Paldiski Bay (Estonia), Otmutninsk (Russia), and 
Cholovka (Ukraine), where prisoners were forced to work without protection 
on tasks such as the manual cleaning of atomic-powered submarines or the 
underground mining of uranium. Death from radiation was only a matter of 
time. 4 (See Appendix III, p. 1330.) 

At the height of the Glasnost era, local people started digging in the 
Kuropaty Forest near Minsk in Belarus'. They knew that it sheltered the 
remains of men, women, and children killed during the Great Terror fifty 
years before. They uncovered several circular pits, each containing a mass 
grave for c.3,000 bodies. They could see that scores, if not hundreds more 
such pits lay under the pines. But in 1991 they were ordered to stop. They 




planted a cross by the roadside, and left the secrets of the forest intact. 5 

In 1989 the Russian 'Memorial' organization, which devotes itself to 
discovering the truth about Stalinist times, unearthed a pit at Chelyabinsk in 
the Urals dating from the 1930s. It contained 80,000 skeletons. Bullet holes 
in skulls told an unambiguous story. These were not victims who had been 
worked to death in the Gulag. 'People were taken out of their flats', said the 
local photographer, 'and shot with their children at this place.' 6 

One was entitled to ask; how many more such sites did the immensity of 
Russia conceal? 


The three phases of the Stalinist Terror succeeded each other in a rising tide 
of brutality and irrationality. The preliminary terror was directed against 
carefully selected targets. Its victims were mainly second-rank figures-the ex- 
Menshevik managers of the pre-1929 Gosplan, internationalist Marxist 
historians, the Byelorussian intelligentsia, and the minor associates of major 
figures. Lenin's widow, Krupskaya, was warned that she wasn't 'irreplaceable'. 
The Peasant Terror or 'anti-kulak drive' mushroomed after 1932, as peasants 
resisted collectivization or slaughtered their livestock in protest. No clear 
definition of a kulak was available, though poorer peasants were urged to 
denounce their more prosperous neighbours. The Terror-Famine 1932-3 was a 
dual-purpose by-product of collectivization, designed to suppress Ukrainian 
nationalism and the most important concentration of prosperous peasants at one 
throw, [harvest] 

The Political Terror or 'Purges' began in earnest in December 1934 with the 
murder of S. M. Kirov, the Party leader in Leningrad. From that starting-point, it 
spread out in ever-widening circles until it engulfed the leadership of the CPSU, 
including officers of the Red Army and of OGPU itself, and eventually the entire 
population. Since every victim was required to denounce ten or twenty 
'accomplices' and their families, it was only a matter of time before the numbers 
involved were being counted in thousands and, in the end, in millions. The initial 
purpose was to destroy all the surviving Bolsheviks and everything they stood 
for. But that was only a beginning. Participants in the XVIIth Party Congress of 
1934, the 'Congress of Victors', meekly hailed Stalin's triumph over the 
'opposition', only to find themselves accused and decimated in turn. After the 
three main show trials of Zinoviev (1936), Pyatykov (1937), and Bukharin 




(1938), the sole Bolshevik leader left alive was Trotsky, who survived in his 
fortified Mexican refuge until 1940. But the full fury of the indiscriminate 
Yezovshchina, the Terror of N. I. Yezhov, Stalin's chief hangman, was still to be 
unleashed. Such was the dynamic of the infernal machine that early in 1939 
Stalin and Molotov were signing lists of several thousand named victims each 
morning, whilst every regional branch of the security police was scooping up far 
greater quotas of random civilian innocents. The Terror did not take a pause until 
at the XVIIIth Congress of March 1939 Stalin coolly denounced Yezhov as a 
degenerate; and it did not stop completely until the VozhcT himself expired. 

For many decades, opinion in the outside world was unable to comprehend 
the facts. Prior to the documentary writings of Alexander Solzhenitsyn in the 
1960s, and the publication of painstaking research by a few courageous scholars, 
most people in the West thought that stories of the Terror were much 
exaggerated. Most sovietologists sought to minimize it. The Soviet authorities 
did not admit to it until the late 1980s. Stalin, unlike Hitler, did not pay the price 
of public exposure. The total tally of his victims can never be exactly calculated; 
but it is unlikely to be much below 50 millions.- 

Without doubt, Stalinism was the child of Leninism; on the other hand, it 
acquired many specific characteristics which were not important in Lenin's 
lifetime. Trotsky classified the change as the 'Thermidorian Reaction', and it 
greatly complicates all debates on Soviet and Communist history. The central 
fact to remember is that Stalinism was the mode within which Soviet 
Communism stabilized, and which provided the foundations of Soviet life in the 
USSR until 1991. For this reason it is Stalin's version of Communism, not 
Lenin's, that must be addressed whenever any general assessment of the system 
is to be made. (See Appendix III, p. 1321.) 


HARVEST 

Aquarter of the rural population, men, women and children, lay dead or 
dying' in 'a great stretch of territory with some forty million inhabitants', 
'like one vast Belsen'. 'The rest, in various stages of debilitation', 'had no 
strength to bury their families or neighbours'. '(As at Belsen), well-fed 
squads of police or party officials supervised the victims.' 1 





In 1932-3, as part of the Soviet collectivization campaign, the Stalinist 
regime had unleashed a man-made terror-famine in Ukraine and the 
neighbouring Cossack lands. All food stocks were forcibly requisitioned; a 
military cordon prevented all supplies from entering; and the people were 
left to die. The aim was to kill Ukrainian nationhood, and with it the 'class 
enemy'. The death toll reached some 7 million. 2 The world has seen many 
terrible famines, many aggravated by civil war. But a famine organized as a 
genocidal act of state policy must be considered unique. 

The writer Vasily Grossman would later describe the children: 

Have you ever seen the newspaper photos of the children in German camps? 
They were just like that; their heads like heavy balls on thin little necks, like 
storks ... and the whole skeleton was stretched over with skin like yellow 
gauze ... And by spring, they no longer had faces at all. Instead they had 
birdlike heads with beaks-or frog heads-thin white lips-and some of 
them resembled fish, mouths open ... These were Soviet children and those 
who were putting them to death were Soviet people. 3 

The outside world was not informed. In the USA a Pulitzer Prize was 
given to the New York Times correspondent, who spoke freely in private of 
millions of deaths but published nothing. 4 In England, George Orwell 
complained that [the terror-famine] had 'escaped the attention of the 
majority of English russophiles'. 5 

The historian who eventually brought convincing proof to the event 
struggled to convey its enormity. He wrote a book of 412 pages, with about 
500 words per page, then stated in the Preface: 'about twenty human lives 
were lost, not for every word, but for every letter in this book.' 6 


As it happened, 1929, the year of Stalin's revolution in the USSR, was also the 
year of crisis in the capitalist world. Historians have wondered whether the two 
events were not somehow linked, perhaps through the rhythms of post-war 
economic adjustment. At all events, on 24 October 1929, 'Black Thursday', the 
prices of shares on the New York Stock Exchange suddenly collapsed. Panic set 
in; banks recalled their loans; and, before anyone could control it, the Great 
Depression was rolling round all the countries with whom the USA did business. 




It was a backhanded compliment to the extent of American influence in the 
world economy. In the USA itself, the sudden end to the easy credit of the 
'roaring twenties' caused a massive wave of bankruptcies, which in turn caused 
an accompanying wave of unemployment. At the height of the 'Slump', in 1933, 
one-third of the American labour force was out of work; the steel industry was 
working at 10 per cent of its capacity; food stocks were destroyed because 
hungry workers could not afford to buy them; and 'poverty raged amidst plenty'. 

In Europe, which was stmggling to pay its war debts, often from dwindling 
reserves of gold, the effects of the Slump were felt with little more than a year's 
delay. In May 1931 Austria's leading bank, the Kreditanstalt of Vienna declared 
itself insolvent; in June the USA had to accept a moratorium on all debts owed 
by European governments; and in September the Bank of England was forced to 
take sterling off the gold standard. Confidence, the corner-stone of capitalism, 
was breaking down. Within a couple of years business had lost its way, and 30 
million workers had lost their jobs. By 1934 the USA had a new, dynamic 
President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose New Deal programme of government- 
funded works was to haul America back to prosperity. 'The only thing we have 
to fear,' he said, 'is fear itself'. But Europe had no Roosevelt, and no New Deal. 
Recovery was as slow as the Slump was sudden. 

The effects of the Depression were psychological and political as well as 
purely economic. Everyone from banker to bellboy was perplexed. The Great 
War had brought death and destruction; but it had also brought a purpose to life 
and full employment. Peace appeared to bring neither. There were men who said 
that life amidst the danger and comradeship of the trenches was preferable to life 
on the dole. Others said that Spengler's gloomy broodings about Europe 
returning to a Dark Age were correct. The anxieties brimmed over into violence 
on the streets: left-wing battle squads pitched into right-wing gangs in many 
European cities. It was the season for charlatans, adventurers, and extremists, 
[moarte] 

In Germany, the rise of Hitler and his Nazi Party was unquestionably connected 
to the Great Depression. But the connection was not a simple one. The Nazis did 
not march on Berlin at the head of an army of unemployed; there was no 'seizure 
of power'. Hitler did not have to topple a weakened government as the 
Bolsheviks did, nor threaten the head of state, like Mussolini. He came to power 
through participation in Germany's democratic process, and at the invitation of 
the lawful authorities. It is beside the point that he and his ruffians were anything 



but democrats or constitutionalists at heart. 

German politics were specially vulnerable to the Depression, whose effects 
were poured into a cup of insecurity already full to the brim. The rancour of 
defeat still lingered. The street battles of extreme left and extreme right were 
ever-present. Democratie leaders were mercilessly squeezed both by the Allied 
Powers and by voters' fears. The German economy had been tortured for a 
decade, first by reparations, then by hyperinflation. By the end of the 1920s it 
was exceptionally dependent on American loans. When Stresemann died in 
October 1929, several days before the Crash, it took no genius to forecast 
turbulence ahead. None the less, the turbulence which ensued in 1930-3 was 
accompanied by several unusual and unforeseen circumstances. 

In those years, the Nazis took part for the first time in a rash of five 
parliamentary elections. On three successive occasions they increased both their 
popular vote and their list of elected deputies. On the fourth occasion, in 
November 1932, their support declined; and they never won an outright majority. 
But in a very short time they had established themselves as the largest single 
party in the Reichstag. What is more, the rising tide of street violence, to which 
Nazi gangs greatly contributed, took place in a much-changed international 
setting. In the early 1920s, Communist-led strikes and demonstrations were 
overshadowed by the apparently limitless power of the Entente. German 
industrialists and German democrats knew exactly whom to call in if the 
Communists ever tried to take over. But in the early 1930s Britain, France, and 
the USA were in no better fettle than Germany, and the Soviet Union was seen to 
be modernizing with remarkable energy. With the communists claiming almost 
as many votes as the Nazis, Germany's conservative leaders had much-reduced 
means to keep the red menace at bay. 

Somewhere in German political culture there also lurked the feeling that 
general elections could be supplemented by a national plebiscite on specific 
controversial issues. Given the chance, Hitler would not miss it. In the chaos of 
crumbling Cabinets, one of the transient ministers invoked emergency 
presidential powers. In September 1930, in the interests of democracy, one 
minority Chancellor persuaded President Hindenburg to activate Article 48 of 
the Weimar Constitution. Henceforth, the German president could 'use armed 
force to restore order and safety and suspend 'the fundamental rights of the 
citizen'. It was an instrument which others could exploit to overthrow 
democracy. 



The sequence of events was crucial. The storm raged for three years: 
deepening recession, growing cohorts of unemployed, communists fighting anti¬ 
communists on the streets, indecisive elections, and endless Cabinet crises. In 
June 1932 another minority Chancellor, Franz von Papen, gained the support of 
the Reichstag by working with the Nazi deputies. Six months later, he cooked up 
another combination: he decided to make Hitler Chancellor, with himself as 
Vice-Chancellor, and to put three Nazi ministers out of twelve into the Cabinet. 
President Hindenburg, and the German right in general, thought it a clever idea: 
they thought they were using Hitler against the Communists. In fact, when Hitler 
accepted the invitation, suitably dressed in top hat and tails, it was Hitler who 
was using them. 

Less than a month later, and a week before the next elections, a mysterious 
fire demolished the Reichstag building. The Nazis proclaimed a Red plot, 
arrested communist leaders, won 44 per cent of the popular vote in the frenzied, 
anti-communist atmosphere, then calmly passed an Enabling Act granting the 
Chancellor dictatorial powers for four years. In October Hitler organized a 
plebiscite to approve Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations and 
from the Disarmament Conference. He received 96.3 per cent support. In August 
1934, following the President's death, he called another plebiscite to approve his 
own elevation to the new party-state position of'Fiihrer and Reich Chancellor' 
with full emergency powers. This time he received 90 per cent support. Hitler 
was in control. In the final path to the summit, he did not breach the Constitution 
once. The personal responsibility for Hitler's success is easily pinpointed. Four 
years after the event, Hitler received his former partner, von Papen, at 
Berchtesgaden. Hitler said: 'By making me Chancellor, Herr von Papen, you 
made possible the National Socialist Revolution in Germany. I shall never forget 
it.' Von Papen replied, 'Certainly, my Fiihrer.'- 


MOARTE 


In 1927 the Legion of the Archangel Michael was formed in Bucharest by 
Comeliu Codreanu. Together with its paramilitary wing, the Iron Guard, it 
grew into one of Europe's more violent Fascist movements. In 1937 it 
secured a substantial share of a large right-radical vote, and in 1940-1, in 
alliance with General Antonescu's army, it briefly commanded Romania's 
'National Legionary State'. In February 1941, having rebelled against its 
military allies, it was suppressed. 

The Legion's ideology expounded a peculiar variation on the theme of 
'Blood and Soil', giving a special place to 'the bones of the ancestors'. In 
resurrecting Romania's fortunes it claimed to have created one national 
community of the quick and the dead. Party rituals centred on a death cult. 
Meetings began with a roll-call of fallen comrades, whose names were 
greeted with the shout of 'Present'. Earth from the tombs of saints was 
mingled with the 'blood-soaked soil' of Party battlefields. Grandiose 
ceremonies attended the exhumation, cleaning, and reburial of the corpses of 
Party martyrs. The exhumation of 'the Captain', Codreanu, murdered in 
1938, constituted the grandest event of the Legion's months in power. Nazi 
planes flew overhead, dropping wreaths on the open tomb. Codreanu's death 
was one among hundreds of political murders in Romania in the late 1930s, 
when the Legion's death squads fought a running battle with the King's 
political police. Codreanu was garrotted, shot in the head, and disfigured by 
acid, before being buried in secret under seven tons of concrete. 

In Romania, Serbia, and Greece, Orthodox belief maintains that the soul 
of the deceased cannot depart until the flesh has decomposed. For this 
reason, families traditionally gather three to seven years after the first burial 
and exhume the skeleton, which is then lovingly cleaned and washed in wine 
before committal to eternal rest. It is also believed that certain categories of 
corpse are unable to decompose. The Orthodox service of excommunication 
contains the phrase 'May thy body never dissolve'. In cases of murder and 
suicide, the tormented souls are thought to remain indefinitely trapped in the 
grave. In the district of Maramures, a ceremonial 'Wedding of the Dead' is 



held to placate them. 

In certain regions of Romania, folk tradition further holds that a trapped 
soul can take flight between sundown and cock-crow. Especially on St 
Andrew's Day (30 November) and on St Michael's Eve (8 November), the 
reanimated corpse returns to haunt the world, slipping through keyholes to 
take sexual favours from its sleeping victims and to suck their blood. To 
guard against such visitations, peasants will lead a black stallion into the 
graveyard. Wherever it shies from stepping over a grave, they drive a great 
stake through the suspect corpse, to pin it down. From the earliest 
ethnographic studies, it is well known that this is vampire country. 1 

Political scientists have concluded that Romanian Fascism was just a 
nasty variety of the genre, with special interests in anti-semitism and 
necrophilia. The anthropologist would conclude that it mobilized deep- 
rooted religious and folk traditions. In December 1991, as soon as the 
Communist dictatorship collapsed, a new 'Movement for Romania' 
emerged, with Codreanu as its hero. 2 


Hitler's democratic triumph exposed the true nature of democracy. 
Democracy has few values of its own: it is as good, or as bad, as the principles 
of the people who operate it. In the hands of liberal and tolerant people, it will 
produce a liberal and tolerant government; in the hands of cannibals, a 
government of cannibals. In Germany in 1933-4 it produced a Nazi government 
because the prevailing culture of Germany's voters did not give priority to the 
exclusion of gangsters. 

Adolf Hitler (1889-1945) was an Austrian who became the master of all 
Germany as no German had ever been. He had been born at Braunau on the 
Bavarian frontier, the son of a customs official, and had grown up with the 
stigma of his father's bastardy (for this reason, unkind acquaintances sometimes 
called him 'Schickelgriiber'). His early life had been painful and, in career 
terms, disastrous. He had some artistic ability, but failed to follow the requisite 
courses, and drifted round Vienna's twilight doss-houses as a part-time decorator 
and postcard artist. Introverted, resentful, and lonely, he was well versed in the 
social pathology of German Vienna's anti-Slav and antisemitic demi-monde. 
Having fled to Munich, he welcomed the First World War, which came as a 
blessed relief to his personal misery. He served with courage, was twice 




decorated with the Iron Cross (second class and first class), survived when his 
comrades died, and was gassed. He ended the war in a military hospital, 
profoundly embittered, [langemarck] 

Hitler's post-war political career filled the void of the early failures. His 
party, the NSDAP, had adopted a brew of commonplace racism, German 
nationalism, and vulgar socialism which proved attractive first to drifters like 
himself and later to millions of voters. On the soap-boxes and street-corners of 
defeated Germany, he found the gift for oratory, or demagoguery, which would 
carry him to the heights. He learned to modulate the pitch and tempo of his 
voice, to gesticulate, to wrap his face in winning smiles and blazing fury, and so 
to captivate an audience that the substance of his words was almost immaterial. 
His skill, which would soon be magnified by searchlights, loudspeakers, and 
musical choruses, can only be likened to that of revivalist preachers or of latter- 
day popstars, whose pseudo-hypnotic performances induce mass hysteria. His 
emotional intensity uncannily matched the feelings of a humiliated nation. He 
played on people's fears, ranting against the 'Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy' and 
the Allies' 'stab in the back'. His one and only attempt to seize power was a total 
fiasco. The 'Beer-Cellar Putsch ' of November 1923 taught him to stick to 'legal 
means'-that is, to mass rallies, electoral procedures, and political blackmail. 
His trial, where he railed impressively at the judges, made him a national figure: 
and his two years in the Landsberg gave him the leisure to write his rambling 
memoirs, Mein Kampf (My Struggle, 1925-6), which became a best-seller. Ein 
Volk, ein Reich, ein Fiihrer was exactly what the majority of Germans wanted to 
hear. He promised to make Germany great again, in a 'Third Reich' that was to 
stand a thousand years. To be precise, he kept it in being for twelve years and 
three months. 'In the Big Lie', he had written, 'there is always a certain force of 
credibility.' 

In his private life, Hitler remained withdrawn, and unmarried until his final 
hours. He loved animals and children, and kept a homely mistress. In contrast to 
his companions, many of whom were swaggering louts, he was well-groomed 
and polite. He has never been linked to personal violence, although he clearly 
gave the (unrecorded) orders for genocide. But his heart was filled with hate. He 
was given to quoting Frederick II, whose portrait hung in his study to the end: 
'Now that I know men, I prefer dogs.'- His one passion was architecture. In the 
1920s he built himself a magnificent mountain chalet, the Berghof, perched on a 
peak near Berchtesgaden. Later, he revelled in grandiose plans to rebuild the 
ruins of Berlin or to turn his native Linz into the art centre of Europe. Western 


commentators have built Hitler up into an 'evil genius'. 'Evil' is accurate, 
'genius' doubtful, [bogey] 

Once at the helm, Hitler moved swiftly to eliminate rivals and opponents. He 
had to crush the socialist wing of the NSDAP, which had considerable 
popularity, and which had been calling for the 'second, socialist revolution' to 
follow his own success. On the night of 30 June 1934, 'the Night of the Long 
Knives', he called in the Party's new elite guard, the SS 'Blackshirts', to cut 
down the Party's older formation of stormtroopers, the SA 'Brownshirts'. All the 
Fiihrer's immediate rivals were killed at a stroke-Ernst Rohm, the SA leader, 
Gregor Strasser, the Party's leading socialist, General von Schleicher, the Nazis' 
leading ally in parliament. Having banned the German Communist Party in 
1933, he then dissolved all the other parties. Assuming Hindenburg's office of 
Commander-in-Chief, he won the army to his side and proceeded to remove 
unreliable elements. 

Hitler arrived with no grand economic design. After all, Germany did not 
need to be modernized as Russia did. But he soon gained a feel for collectivist 
economics, and was offered a ready-made scheme by Dr Hjalmar Schacht, 
President of the Reichsbank. His initial industrial backers were demanding 
action, and he guessed that action would generate confidence and employment. 
Schacht's plan combined Keynesian financial management with complete state 
direction of industry and agriculture: the trade unions were replaced by a Nazi 
labour front; strikes were outlawed. The new deal, like its American counterpart, 
aimed at full production and full employment through a state-funded work 
creation programme. The flagship projects included the building of the German 
Autobahns (1933-4) the launching of the Volkswagen (1938), and, above all, 
rearmament. 

The relationship between Nazism and German industry provides a most 
contentious issue. One standard interpretation, much favoured by communist 
scholarship, posited 'the primacy of economics'. According to this, the interests 
of big business determined not only short-term political policy, aimed at the 
destruction of the German left, but long-term strategic policy as well. Germany's 
expansion to the East was supposedly motivated by German industry's demands 
for raw materials, secure oil, and cheap labour. A contrary interpretation has 
posited the 'primacy of politics'. In this view, Hitler soon threw off the tutelage 
of the industrialists and developed the state-owned sector as a counterweight to 
private industry. As from 1936, the introduction of a Four-Year Plan, the 



replacement of Schacht as chief economic adviser, and the promotion of the 
state-owned steel corporation, the Reichswerke Hermann Goring, all pointed in 
that direction. A compromise interpretation argues on the basis of the shifting 
alliances of a 'poly-cratic power centre' made up of the NSDAP, army, and 
industry.- Rearmament was important for psychological and for political 
reasons. The German armaments sector, which had been artificially constrained, 
could recover very quickly; Krupps' turnover began to improve dramatically 
from 1933. But rearmament also healed Germany's wounded pride; and it won 
over the army, which in 1935-6 was able to reintroduce conscription. Hitler had 
no precise plans for using his rearmed forces. But it was convenient to let people 
think that the gun under his coat was loaded. 

Agriculture was not a subject that interested the Nazis. They came up with a 
scheme for the formation of co-operatives. But the main thrust was to guarantee 
state-fixed prices, and hence the farmers' security. 

Nazi ideology, to put it mildly, was not very sophisticated. Unlike Stalin, 
Hitler did not inherit a corpus of party thought which could be bent to his own 
purposes. His one and only work, Mein Kampf (1925), which was to find its way 
onto the bookshelf of almost every German family, contained only two or three 
consistent ideas, and nothing original. Most important was the chain of argument 
which led from the supposed existence of the Herrenvolk or 'master race' to the 
supposed German right to Lebensraum or 'living space' in the East. 

Hitler took a hierarchy of races for granted. He divided mankind into 
'culture-founders', 'culture-bearers', and 'culture destroyers'. 'The bearers of 
human cultural development' today were 'the Aryans'. 'The mightiest 
counterpart to the Aryan is the Jew.' The Jews were the Todfeind, the mortal 
enemy. He did not care to define the Aryans, nor to establish a hierarchy of 
nations within the Aryan race. His chapter on the subject starts with the 
observation that some things are so obvious that they don't need explaining.- 
Hitler also believed in 'the iron logic' of'racial purity'. 'In every mingling of 
Aryan blood with that of lower people', he observed, 'the result was the end of 
the cultured people.' 'All great cultures of the past perished ... from blood- 
poisoning.'- Hitler believed that the health of a nation was dependent on the 
value of its national territory. 'Only an adequately large space on this earth 
assures a nation freedom of existence.' 'The foreign policy of the folkish state 
must... create a healthy relation between the nation's population and the quantity 
and quality of its soil.'- 


BOGEY 


Soon after the German Army occupied Austria in March 1938, Adolf Hitler 
is said to have ordered the commander of Wehrkreis XVII to demolish the 
village of Dollersheim by 'target practice'. The inhabitants were evacuated, 
and all the buildings of the village, including the cemetery, were duly 
reduced to rubble by artillery. The point behind this savage operation seems 
to have been that both Hitler's father and paternal grandmother, Maria Anna 
Schicklgruber, were buried at Dollersheim, and that Hitler had recently 
learned the facts of his father's early life. According to a Gestapo report, the 
young Fraulein Schicklgruber had conceived Hitler's father when working as 
an unmarried domestic servant in a rich Jewish household. The implications, 
from Hitler's point of view, were disturbing. 

From this, and many other indications, there is reason to believe that 
Hitler suffered from intense feelings of repressed guilt, shame, and self- 
hatred about his origins, his blood, his body, and his personality. One is not 
obliged to take the conflicting evidence at face value to conclude that Hitler 
is a prime subject for 'psycho-history'. 1 

Particularly interesting, and possibly crucial to the Fiihrer's wartime state 
of mind, was his rampant hypochondria. From 1936 to 1945 he placed total 
faith in a dubious physician, Dr Theo Morell, who treated him with constant 
massive doses of glucose, vitamins, stimulants, appetizers, relax-ants, 
tranquillizers, and sedatives, usually by direct intravenous injections. Hitler's 
obsession with flatulence addicted him to a huge daily diet of anti-gas pills 
based on atropine and strychnine. Morell's rivals unsuccessfully reported to 
the Gestapo that Morell was poisoning the Fiihrer by stealth. 2 

Soldiers can be intuitive. Sometime during the Second World War, 
marching to the magnificent beat of 'Colonel Bogey', someone in the British 
Army composed the immortal refrain: 



'itler - 'as only got one ball; 
Goering has two but far too small, 
'immler - is rather sim'ler, 



But Gerballs-'as no balls-at all. 3 

The point here is that twenty years later, when the Soviet authorities released 
the text of a supposed autopsy report on the late Fiihrer's corpse, it stated 
that 'the left testicle was missing'. 4 The report bore traces of a KGB plant, 
and was not supported by other witnesses. But some historians have taken it 
seriously. Since congenital monorchidism is rare, they have concluded that 
Hitler must have mutilated himself by self-castration. 5 The mystery was not 
resolved by the opening of the KGB files in the 1990s. 6 

Yet the observations do not stop with the physical evidence. Numerous 
aspects of Hitler's conduct hint at something hideous beneath the demure 
exterior. He permitted no talk in his presence about even mildly sexual 
matters. He had a deep fear of incest. He professed revulsion about 'filth' of 
all sorts. Although the evidence is contradictory, his sex life was either 
totally sublimated or disgustingly perverse. 

At every stage, Hitler's brilliant openings were paralysed by a pervasive 
sense of failure. And he repeatedly flirted with suicide. In his love of 
political ritual, he indulged in a range of pseudo-religious Catholic parodies. 
Above all, he felt constantly impelled to say that history, or the German 
nation, or God, or whatever, had found him wilrdig -'worthy'. The 
inference has to be that the cauldron of self-hatred which seethed within him 
fuelled the overt hatred which he then projected onto Jews, Slavs, 
communists, homosexuals, and gipsies, and eventually onto Germany 
herself. 

Needless to say, self-mockery is a healthier mechanism than self-praise. In 
the First World War, the British had marched to another magnificent refrain, 
sung to the lugubrious hymn tune of 'Greenland's Icy Mountains': 



'We are Fred Carno's Army,- the ragtime infantry. 
We cannot fight; we cannot shoot; 

No bleedin' use are we. 

And when we get to Berlin, the Kaiser he will say: 















Hochl Hoch! Mein Gotti What a bloody awful lot 
Are the British Infantry!' 6 


Since Germany's neighbours already possessed land in abundance, either in 
the colonies or, in Russia's case, through the conquest of the steppes, Germany 
could only compete by seizing the adjacent lands to the East. 'We stop the 
endless German movement to the South and West, and turn our gaze towards the 
land in the East.'- German expansion into Poland and Ukraine would give her 
the strength not only to fight Russia but also to check France, also 'the mortal 
enemy'. Hitler believed that Germany was fighting at a disadvantage in its 
struggle to exist. 'Germany is no world power,' he wailed. 'Germany will either 
be a world power, or there will be no Germany.'- 

Overt racism was accompanied by a collectivist creed which has often been 
described in vague terms such as 'the herd instinct', but which has distinct 
Marxist overtones. Of his own debt to the Marxism of the pre-war SPD, Hitler 
once said: 

I had only to develop logically what social democracy failed in... National socialism is what Marxism 
might have been if it could have broken its absurd ties with a democratic order ... Why need we trouble to 
socialise banks and factories? We socialise human beings.- 

Recent studies have shown that the young Hitler was familiar with Marxist 
writing, and was impressed by the flag-waving rallies of the Austrian Social 
Democrats.- He may have absorbed more than he knew: the Nazis did not have 
a strong intellectual tradition, but their reticence does not mean that a primitive 
sort of socialism lay beyond their horizons. It was the Nazis who first instituted 
May Day as a national festival for (German) workers. 

Nazi policies were deduced very rationally from these few shaky 
propositions. Hitler's racist nationalism led immediately to the introduction of 
antisemitic measures. Jews were excluded from state employment and from 
German citizenship; Jewish traders were officially boycotted; marriage and 
sexual intercourse between Jews and non-Jews was forbidden. These measures 
received their clearest formulation in the Nurnberg Laws of 1935. From the start 
the Nazis favoured euthanasia, the killing of the mentally and genetically 
handicapped, and the rewarding of multiple childbirth achieved by heroic 
German motherhood. On the social plane, the Nazis were contemptuous of all 





the existing hierarchies-aristocracy, officer corps, professions, and guilds. The 
ranks of the Nazi Party-State were thrown open to everyone who was prepared 
to serve without shame or dissent. Offices were filled by the advancement in 
every German town and village of the most vulgar, unqualified, and grasping 
elements. Their idols were the failed chicken farmer, Heinrich Himmler, who ran 
the SS, or the overweight ex-pilot, Reichsmarschall Hermann Goring, who could 
no longer squeeze into a cockpit.- Here was another close counterpart to the 
ethos of the burgeoning Stalinist bureaucracy of the USSR. 

Nazism, like Stalinism, was strong on official fictions. Nazi propaganda 
peddled many strange notions. Hitler was the new Frederick or the new 
Bismarck. The Nazis were successors to the Germanic gods or the Teutonic 
Knights. The Third Reich was the natural heir to the Holy Roman Empire and to 
the Hohenzollerns. The German people, united and free, knew unbounded love 
for their homeland, unlimited joy in their learning and art, untrammelled pride in 
their emancipated women, unstinting wrath against traitors and enemies... It was 
all rather familiar. The cult of Hitler's personality knew no bounds. The Fiihrer 
was the embodiment of all that is beautiful, wise, and good. 

Most Nazi leaders were unbelievers; Hitler himself was a lapsed Catholic. 
Their rituals owed more to the parody of ancient Germanic paganism than to any 
modern religion. So they had a major problem in defining their relationship with 
a German nation that was still predominantly Christian. As often as not, they 
ignored the theoretical issues. But to pacify the Catholics, Hitler signed a 
Concordat with the Vatican in July 1933, confirming the autonomy of the 
German See in return for the hierarchy's renunciation of political involvement. 
The compromise encouraged some Catholic prelates, such as Archbishop 
Innitzer of Vienna, to express sympathy for Nazi aims. But it did not prevent the 
Vatican from ordering Mit brennender Sorge (1937), which denounced Nazi 
ideology, to be read in all Catholic churches in Germany. To manage the 
Protestants, Hitler announced the creation in 1935 of a state-controlled Union of 
Protestant Churches. There was also an attempt to found a new movement for 
'German Christians', where the swastika embraced the cross, under 
Reichsbishop Dr Muller. In November 1933 these pseudo-Christian Nazi 
surrogates staged a demonstration in Berlin to the honour of 'Christ the Hero'. In 
the end, religion and irreligion had to co-exist as best they could. 

In the field of coercion and terror the Nazis were fast learners. Their 
'Brownshirts' and 'Blackshirts' had a solid grounding in common fraud, 


blackmail, and thuggery. On the other hand, at the head the German Rechtsstaat, 
they did not have 500 years of the Muscovite oprichniki behind them. The 
structures of social control were less complete than in the USSR. There was no 
state monopoly in employment; there was no collectivized countryside; and there 
were no party cells or commissars in the Wehrmacht until 1944. All of which 
goes some way to explain the Nazis' special style, where studied bestial ferocity 
had to compensate for structural weaknesses. A high level of well-publicized 
bmtality was required, simply because more refined instruments of control were 
often lacking. 

The security organs of the Reich never assumed the monstrous proportions of 
their Soviet counterparts. Both the Party Guard, the Schutzstaffeln, and the 
Gestapo, the 'Secret State Police', were used by the Party to supplement existing 
military and police forces. But neither was given the same range of competence 
invested in the NKVD. One concentration camp was opened at Dachau, near 
Munich, in 1934; but the number of prisoners was dropping in the late 1930s. 
Nazi-run People's Courts and People's Judges increasingly absorbed the work of 
the traditional judiciary. But wholesale terror was not the norm. In Germany 
itself, Nazi violence stayed within predictable parameters. Germans who 
conformed could expect to survive. Some 500,000 German Jews were 
persecuted and expelled; the Kristallnacht of 1938, when Jewish synagogues and 
shops were smashed, caused vast damage and apprehension. But it does not 
appear that 'the Final Solution' was planned in advance. At no point prior to the 
outbreak of war did the Reich possess the facilities or the modern death 
technology which it subsequently employed. It is an open question how far the 
Nazis emulated the Soviet terror machine, which was both older and larger than 
theirs. 

Political scientists worry too much about the theoretical classification of 
Nazism. Some, after Arendt, accept that it was a member of the totalitarian 
family, others, after Nolte, think of it as one of the 'three faces of Fascism'; 
others prefer to leave it as a movement sui generis.- It was one, none, or all of 
these things, according to the criteria one chooses. Less than fifty years after the 
last Nazi fell from grace, many analysts are still strongly swayed by personal 
rancour, by political bias, or by the victors' syndrome. Suffice it to say, if 
personal views are permitted, that Nazism was the most repulsive movement of 
modern times. The ideals of its utopia were no less ugly than the realities of its 
Reich. 


Europe, wracked by the Depression, was in poor shape to meet the challenge 
posed by Stalin and Hitler. The Western Powers were absorbed with their own 
affairs. The USA was absent. The states of East Central Europe were weak and 
divided. At the very time that the idea of collective security was mooted, 
Europe's attention was diverted by the Civil War in Spain. 

Britain at the end of the Great War had retreated into its island and imperial 
concerns. There were crises enough in Ireland, in India, and in Palestine. Despite 
the formation of two Labour governments, labour troubles multiplied at home. 
The General Strike of May 1926, the launching of the communist Daily Worker 
(1930), the Labour Party's expulsion of its own leader, Ramsay MacDonald, for 
forming a National Government (1931), and the creation of Sir Oswald Mosley's 
British Union of Fascists (1932), all took place to the background of 
unemployment rising to 3 million. The Conservative Government headed first by 
Stanley Baldwin and then by Neville Chamberlain was elected in 1935 on 
promises of stability and good management. Its principal headache prior to the 
Munich Crisis lay in the young King's love affair with an American divorcee and 
his subsequent abdication. All the while, a remarkable series of social and 
technological advances were taking place: the initiation of the BBC (1922), of 
family planning (1922), of full women's suffrage (1928), and of paperback 
books (1935); the invention of television (1926), penicillin (1928), and the jet 
engine (1937). The British generation which came to maturity after the Great 
War felt that they had lived through enough stresses; the last thing they wanted 
to worry about was storm clouds on the Continent. 

France could not withdraw from the Continent. In the 1920s French policy 
gave priority to building security, partly by the hard line towards Germany and 
partly through the 'Little Entente' in the East (see below). But then the emphasis 
shifted. The 1930s saw the heyday of French Algiers and French Saigon, whilst 
at home the Depression brought labour issues to the fore, edouard Daladier 
(1884-1970), a radical socialist, twice served as Premier, whilst shifting 
coalitions and the Stavisky scandal (1934) aroused widespread disillusionment. 
Political opinion polarized, with the Parti Communiste Francais and Action 
Fran^aise both vociferous. A whole stereotype of allegedly static French 
attitudes came to be associated with the name of Andre Maginot, Minister of 
War 1929-32 and constructor of a vast line of fortifications along the eastern 
frontier. This was not entirely fair. It is not true, as the British were later to 
charge, that the French army was unwilling to fight; but in the absence of any 
significant British force, it did not relish the task of fighting Germany single- 



handed; and it was locked into organizational plans that impeded early offensive 
action. 

Scandinavia in the 1930s was fortunate in lying beyond the sphere of 
strategic tensions. Sweden was hard hit by recession in the iron trade, but 
responded under the Social Democrats by organizing the most comprehensive 
system of social welfare in the world, [socialis] 

East Central Europe, in contrast, lay in the eye of the gathering storm. With 
Hitler on one side and Stalin on the other, its leaders had every right to be 
nervous. Security arrangements made by the French in the 1920s had several 
serious loopholes. The concept of the cordon sanitaire which began as a belt of 
states holding off Soviet Russia, was not pursued with any consistency. The 
'Little Entente', which joined Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia in a 
cooperative system designed for the containment of a resurgent Hungary, did not 
include Poland-the largest country of the region-and from 1934 was matched 
by an independent Balkan Pact of Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey. 
The Western Powers had no high reputation for decisiveness. When Warsaw had 
been attacked by the Red Army in 1920, they sent a flurry of unsolicited military 
missions, but no military reinforcements. In 1934, when Marshal Pikudski took 
soundings in Paris about a preventative war against Nazi Germany, he elicited no 
response. The Western Powers never quite decided whether their policy in 
Eastern Europe was to be based on the new states, like Poland, or on the 
congenial post-Bolshevik Russia, which never materialized. From 1935, when 
their fear of Hitler outgrew their dislike of Stalin, they turned to a hyena to tame 
a wolf. 

In East Central Europe, the international crisis of the 1930s inevitably 
affected internal affairs. The communist parties, usually illegal, had little popular 
support except in Czechoslovakia; but they acted as an important irritant, 
provoking nationalist elements to react. Hitler, when he wasn't inciting the 
German minorities in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania, encouraged other 
nationalistic elements to emulate him. In the process dictatorships were 
strengthened, military budgets soared, the political role of the officer class 
increased; nationalism and ethnic conflicts of all sorts intensified. 

In Poland, for example, the vicinity of Stalin and Hitler could be sensed on 
every hand. Marshal Pilsudski, who signed a non-aggression pact with the USSR 
in 1932 and another with Germany in 1934, sought an even-handed stance 
summed up in his 'doctrine of two enemies'. The Polish Communist Party, 



which had opposed Poland's independence in 1918-20, had adopted an 
internationalist and Trotskyite leaning. Its exiled leadership, largely Jewish, was 
liquidated en masse during Stalin's purges. At the other extreme, the National 
Democratic movement spawned a fascistic offshoot, the Falanga, which was 
also banned. Militant nationalistic organizations sprang up in each of the 
national minorities. The Ukrainian OUN-a radical offshoot of the older UWO 
organisation- indulged in common terrorism and provoked brutal pacifications 
of the peasants. Zionism made rapid headway in the Jewish community, where 
'revisionist' groups such as Betar spawned militants such as Menachem Begin or 
Yitzak Shamir, who would shine elsewhere. A Nazi Fifth Column was organized 
among the German minority. The activities of all these groups fuelled the fires of 
mutual hatred. After Pilsudski's death in 1935, the so-called 'Government of 
Colonels' strove to check the centrifugal forces by forming a Camp of National 
Unity (OZON). But they found that the main opposition parties joined forces 
against them. General Sikorski joined Paderewski in Switzerland in the anti¬ 
government Morges Front. Priority was given to belated military reform and, in 
a state economic plan, to rearmament. The Foreign Minister, Colonel Jozef 
Beck, trod an even-handed course which displeased the Western Powers, who 
wanted him to co-operate with Stalin. Towards his lesser neighbours, however, 
he thumped the nationalist drum. He set his eyes on the district of Zaolzie 
(Polish Cieszyn), which had been forcibly seized by the Czechs in 1919. And in 
early 1939 he sent a brusque ultimatum to Lithuania demanding an end to the 
state of undeclared war. Violent incidents were few; but the threat of violence 
was abroad. 

Poland's Jewish community-still the largest in Europe-lived out its last 
summers. In the late 1930s apprehension about the future was growing, 
especially when waves of Jewish refugees and expellees arrived from Germany. 
Various forms of petty harassment, in education, municipal laws, and 
employment, were on the rise, but there was nothing to compare with the 
rampages of the Nazis. For anyone who has seen the pictures and documents of 
those years, the image is one of a vibrant, variegated communal life. The Jewish 
kahals enjoyed full autonomy. Jewish parties of many hues were free to operate. 
There were Jewish film stars, Jewish boxing champions, Jewish women MPs, 
Jewish millionaires. To say, as is sometimes done, that Polish Jewry was 'on the 
edge of destruction' is true enough; but it is to read history backwards.- 

Czechoslovakia had a reputation for democracy that was stronger abroad 
than among the country's own German, Slovak, Hungarian, Polish, and 



Ruthenian minorities. Exceptionally for the region, it was highly industrialized, 
it had a genuine communist movement, and it looked to Russia for moral 
support. During the long presidency of the great T. G. Masaryk, who retired in 
1935, it held together. 

The 'Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes' changed its name to the 
Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. It had no common history, language, or 
religion. It had come into being on the initiative of Slovenes and Croats from 
Austro-Hungary, who urged the Serbian establishment to admit them and then 
came to resent Serbian domination. The Serbian monarchy and army played the 
central role, particularly after the establishment of a unitary royal dictatorship in 
1929. In Catholic Croatia, the national party of Stefan Radie* gained the upper 
hand in local affairs that had been impossible under Hungarian rule, only to find 
its voice blocked in Belgrade. Slovenia prospered quietly under its leader, Father 
Korosec, the original convenor of the Yugoslav National Council. Macedonia 
simmered. The climate of violence was heightened by the murder of Radio 
(1929) and then of King Alexander (1934). The democratic Serb opposition 
began to make common cause with the Croats. But time was short: 'Yugoslavia 
is a necessity,' wrote one observer, 'not a predestined harmony.'- (See 
Appendix III, p. 1319.) [Sarajevo] 

In the Mediterranean the main shock-waves were generated by Fascist Italy. 
Mussolini, who liked to talk in ancient Roman style of 'Mare Nostro' (Our Sea), 
was determined to become the regional power. Having eliminated the active 
opposition, who abandoned the parliament after the murder of a socialist deputy, 
he had a free hand. His designs were expedited by a pliant King and by the 
stage-managed organs of a streamlined 'corporate state'. In the 1930s he looked 
further afield: Italian troops were sent to Abyssinia, to Spain, and, in March 
1939, to Albania. The Feague of Nations recommended sanctions, the British 
and the French threatened reprisals, but nothing was actually done. Mussolini 
thrived by baiting Austria over South Tyrol. Prior to the 'Pact of Steel' of 22 
May 1939, and the consequent Rome-Berlin Axis, he liked to flaunt his 
independence from Germany. 

Civil strife had been festering in Spain for at least twenty years. The 
Spaniards met added misfortune by unleashing a civil war at a juncture when 
communist-fascist rivalry was moving to its peak throughout Europe. As a 
result, the military insurrection of 1936 attracted the attention of Hitler and 
Stalin. Spain was turned into a laboratory for Europe's nastiest political 


practices. Three years of agony culminated in the resounding defeat of 
democracy. The roots of the conflict lay deep in Spain's unstable history, in a 
polarized society, and in an intractable land problem. Over half of the land 
belonged to barely 1 per cent of the population. The mass of peasants lived on 
tiny holdings or on starvation wages. The small working class was badly hit by 
the Depression. The Roman Catholic Church, dominated by an ultra-reactionary 
hierarchy, was deeply involved in economic affairs as a major landowner and as 
the controller of many enterprises from the Banco Espiritu Santo to the Madrid 
tramways. An army whose ratio of officers to men was unusually high was a 
bastion of ultramontane and monarchist sentiment. The result was a peculiarly 
obtuse and resistant social fortress composed of priest, squire, and officer, which 
habitually obstructed any reforms that touched their interests. Social protests 
were desperate, vicious, and anticlerical. Anarchists were prominent among both 
the rural labourers of the south and the workers' unions of Barcelona. There 
were separatist provinces in Catalonia, in the Basque country, and, to some 
extent, in Galicia. In Morocco, where the long war against the Riffs ended in 
1925, the army ruled supreme. In 1930-1 the latest lurch of the political seesaw 
brought the downfall of the military dictator, General Primo de Rivera, a lengthy 
interregnum, the Dictablanca, the abdication of King Alfonso, and finally the 
declaration of the Second Republic. 


SARAJEVO 

Whoever lies awake in Sarajevo hears the voices of the Sarajevo night. 
The clock on the Catholic cathedral strikes the hour with weighty 
confidence: 2 a.m. More than a minute passes-seventy-five seconds to be 
exact-and only then does the Orthodox church chime its own 2 a.m. A 
moment later the tower clock on the Bey's Mosque strikes the hour in a 
hoarse, faraway voice; and it strikes 11, the ghostly Turkish hour. The Jews 
have no clock, so God knows what time it is for them ... Thus division keeps 
vigil, and separates these sleeping people, who wake, rejoice, and mourn, 
feast and fast by four different calendars... 

Bosnia is a country of hatred and fear. And the fatal characteristic is that 
the Bosnian is unaware of the hatred which lives within, shrinks from 




analysing it-and hates anyone who tries to do so. Yet there are more people 
ready in fits of subconscious hatred to kill and be killed than in other much 
bigger lands ... It is hatred acting as an independent force: hatred like a 
cancer consuming everything around it. 

And by a strange contrast, it can also be said that there are few countries 
with such firm belief, so much tenderness, such loyalty and unshakeable 
devotion. But in secret depths hide entire hurricanes of compressed and 
maturing hatreds awaiting their hour. The relationship between your loves 
and your hatred is the same as between your high mountains and the 
invisible geological strata beneath them. You are condemned to live on deep 
layers of explosive which are lit from time to time by the very sparks of your 
loves. 

In countries like Bosnia, virtue itself often speaks and acts through 
hatred. Those who do believe and love feel a mortal hatred for those who 
don't, or who believe and love differently. (The most evil and sinister- 
looking faces can be met in greatest numbers at places of worship-at 
monasteries and dervish tekkes.) 

On every occasion you will be told: love your brother, though his 

RELIGION IS OTHER, IT'S NOT THE CROSS THAT MARKS THE SLAV, and RESPECT 

others' ways and take pride in your own. But there has been plenty of 
counterfeit courtesy since time immemorial. Under cover of these maxims, 
old instincts and Cainlike plans may only be slumbering. They will live on 
until the foundations of material and spiritual life are completely changed. 
And when will that time come, and who will have the strength to carry it 
out? 

In some Maupassant story, there is a dionysiac description of spring 
which ends with the remark that on such days there should be a warning 
posted On every corner: citoyens! this is spring-beware of love! 

Perhaps in Bosnia, too, people should be warned ... 1 

These paragraphs are contained in a work that is classed as fiction. They 
enshrine the imagined reflections of an emigrant, who left Bosnia in 1920. 
They were composed in 1946 by Ivo Andrio (1892-1975), child of Travnik, 
student of Zagreb, Vienna, and Krakow, sometime prisoner of the 
Habsburgs, pre-war Yugoslav diplomat, and Nobel laureate. 

Is it really fiction? 'Much of [Andrio's work] is set in Bosnia,' his editor 



explains, 'and is closely dependent on this setting. He roots his stories in a 
specific geographical and historical context.' 2 In other words, an important 
element of the stories is not fiction. Andrio paints the psychological 
landscape of Bosnian society with the same precision that he reports the 
sounds of the Sarajevo night. These descriptions can be treated as invaluable 
historical documents. 

At that same time, in 1946, an experienced welfare officer was working 
for UNRRA in Sarajevo. She presented the opposite opinion. 'It is only by 
working together that people can get over their hatreds,' she wrote. 'Now is a 
good time. Everything that is young is thinking the right way ... Now we 
don't care-is he Moslem, is he Catholic, is he Orthodox? Now it is 
brotherhood and unity.' 


The five years of constitutional government from 1931 to 1936 brought 
mayhem out of chaos. In 1931 the Primate, the Archbishop of Toledo, was exiled 
for denouncing the Republic. In 1932 an abortive pronunciamiento was launched 
by the generals. In 1933 the landowners of the south kept peasants off the land 
rather than accept reform. Legislation introducing state schools and divorce, and 
separating Church from State, could not be implemented. Agrarian reform was 
reversed and sequestrated land returned to its former owners. In 1934 a 
determined strike by miners in Asturias grew into a separatist rising which was 
broken only with massive bloodshed. In the elections of February 1936 the left- 
wing Frente Popular or 'Popular Front' of republicans, socialists, Catalans, and 
communists carried the day. But by then the central government was losing 
control. Recalcitrant peasants were occupying the great estates. Workers were 
organizing one general strike after another. The Catalans were claiming 
autonomy. Political murders and church-burning proliferated. 'We are present 
today' said the outgoing Catholic Prime Minister, 'at the funeral service of 
democracy.' The country was becoming ungovernable. 

On 18 July 1936 the Generals struck for a second time. General Francisco 
Franco (1892-1975) crossed to Tetuan from his command in the Canaries and 
issued a manifesto. Spain was to be saved from Red revolution; the army in 
North Africa would not hesitate to use its Moorish troops. 'The Crusade against 
Marxism', as one republican sympathizer put it, 'was to be undertaken by Moors 
against Catholics.'- 





At the outset, the political spectrum in Spain was extremely wide and 
complicated. In the Cortes, the Popular Front was opposed by a right-wing 
coalition, including the Action Popular or 'People's Action' and the Fascist 
Falange Espanola, recently founded by Primo de Rivera's son. On the left, the 
Communist Party hold only 16 out of the Front's 277 seats, compared to 89 for 
the Socialists headed by Largo Caballero and 84 for Manuel Azana's Left 
Republicans. Inexorably, however, the strains of civil war boosted the fortunes of 
the two most violent and radical extremes. The Falange was destined to become 
the main political instrument of the army. The communists were destined to 
dominate the beleaguered Republic. Franco said, and possibly believed, that he 
was fighting to forestall Bolshevism. His slogan was Fe ciega en la victoria 
'Blind Faith in Victory'. It was beside the point that the communist menace was 
exaggerated, what counted was that many Spaniards feared it. 

The pattern of political and geographical support became very complex. 
When Franco's army command proclaimed its insurrection in Morocco, it 
rebelled against the Government of the Spanish Republic in Madrid, headed at 
the time by Azana. The army could count on garrisons in each of the main cities 
of the mainland, on the paramilitary squads of the Falange, and, in some areas, 
on the ultra-Catholic formations, the Requetes, left over from the Carlist era. 
Generally speaking, they could count on the political support of the Catholic 
hierarchy, of the larger landowners, and of all who gave priority to the 
restoration of law and order. From an early stage they received military 
assistance from Portugal, from Nazi Germany, and from Fascist Italy. Portugal 
offered secure bases. The war-planes of the German Condor Legion provided air 
superiority. Early in 1937 Italian troops occupied the Balearic Islands, and the 
southern coast round Malaga. 

The Government, in contrast, had few professional troops to call its own. In 
time, it trained and fielded a regular force; but it had to rely heavily on the armed 
militias of various left-wing unions-the socialist PSOE, the anarchist FAI, the 
Marxist but anti-Stalinist POUM, the UGT and the communist-run CNT. 
Generally speaking, it could count on the political support of the peasants in the 
countryside, of workers in the towns, of anticlericals everywhere, and of all who 
gave priority to constitutional government. From an early stage they received 
assistance from abroad: tanks, planes, munitions, and advisers from the USSR, 
and in the International Brigades a flood of perhaps 50,000 foreign volunteers. In 
the later stages, in 1938-9, it has to be said that the nightmare painted by Fascist 
propaganda did materialize. Under Dr Negrin, the Government did fall under the 



influence of hard-line communists, and its security agency, the Military 
Investigation Service (SIM), into the direct control of the Soviet GPU. The 
Spanish Republic's gold, transferred to Odessa for safe keeping in September 

1936, was never returned, [adelante] 

The fighting was long, fragmented, and often confused (see Appendix III, p. 
1324). Ragged and vicious local confrontations were more common than 
sustained campaigns or set-piece battles. Behind the lines, massacres of 
prisoners and civilians were perpetrated by both sides. The strategic layout was 
not simple. After the initial exchanges, when army garrisons in Madrid and 
Barcelona were shelled into submission, the Government held most of the 
country except for the northwest at Corunna and the extreme south at Seville. 
But once the army had re-established itself along the Portuguese frontier, and 
captured the central fortress of Toledo, it could gradually envelop the 
Government strongholds on the north coast and in the corridor linking Madrid 
and Valencia. The Army Junta established itself at Burgos, with HQ at 
Salamanca; the Government at Valencia. Outstanding events included the year¬ 
long nationalist siege of Oviedo, the German bombing of Guernica in April 

1937, the lunging operations for control of the Ebro and the strong point of 
Teruel in 1938, and, in 1939, the terminal sieges first of Barcelona (January) and 
then of Madrid (March). In Barcelona, The wildest city in Europe', where 
Catalans and anarchists were opposed to any form of Spanish government, 
whether Red or White, the tragedy ended with frightful massacres perpetrated by 
both the defeated communists and their erstwhile anarchist allies. In Madrid, 
where the rump Council of Defence of the Popular Front eventually renounced 
the communists, it ended with the rebels' triumphal entry on 29 March. At the 
victory parade, Franco could at last voice his slogans with conviction: 'Hay 
orden en el pais' (there is order in the country) and 'Espana, una, grande, libre' 
(Spain is one, great, and free). Republican leaders fled. Thousands of refugees 
poured over the Pyrenees.- Spain lay firmly in the Fascists' grip for 40 years, 
[faraon] 


ADELANTE 


In September 1936, Comintern's propaganda chief in Western Europe I 





advised Moscow to form a series of International Brigades to fight for the 
Spanish Republic. The idea had originated with Maurice Thorez of the Parti 
Communiste Francais, who remembered the 'International Legion of the Red 
Army' which had fought in the Russian Civil War. 1 

From the start, therefore, though the Brigades were presented as the 
spontaneous action of volunteers, they were thoroughly subordinated to the 
Communist movement. They operated outside the regular command of the 
Spanish Republican Army; all their senior military and political staff were 
Communist appointees; and all recruits were vetted by Soviet agents. Their 
slogans were 'Spain-the graveyard of European Fascism', No pasaran 
('They will not pass'), and Adelante, 'Forward'. 

The principal recruiting office in Paris was headed by Jozip Broz, alias 
'Tito', the future dictator of Yugoslavia. It organized a 'secret railway', using 
false passports to send recruits to the Spanish frontier and thence to the 
Brigades' main base at Albacete in La Mancha. 

In Europe of the Depression there was a large pool of manpower to draw 
on-unemployed workers, refugees from the Fascist states, rebel 
intellectuals. Of the 50,000 who served, the biggest contingents were raised 
by the Confederation Generale du Travail in France, by Polish miners' 
organizations in Belgium and the French departement of Le Nord, and by 
left-wing German exiles. Eighty per cent of them were working men. There 
was also a nucleus of foreign volunteers already serving at the front. These 
included German, Italian, French, and British 'columns' (see Appendix III, 
p. 1325). Their leaders included Carlo Rosselli, a socialist who had escaped 
from a Fascist gaol in Italy, and Hans Beimler, a German escapee from 
Dachau. 

The intellectual recruits were few, but vocal. They answered the call, 
often without knowing the implications: 

Many have heard it on remote peninsulas, 

On sleepy plains, in the aberrant fisherman's islands, 

Or the corrupt heart of a city; 

Have heard and migrated like gulls or the seeds of a 
flower. 2 

The military leadership of the Brigades was not experienced in warfare. 
The commander-in-chief, Andre Marty, a Catalan sailor from Perpignan, had 



led a mutiny in the French fleet off Odessa in 1919. The chief military 
adviser, Col. Karol Swierczewski, alias 'Walter', was a Polish officer from 
the Soviet security service, and a professor at the military academy in 
Moscow. The inspector-general, Luigi Longo, and the chief political officer, 
Giuseppe di Vittorio, were Italian Communists. The one commander to show 
real talent was Lazar Stern, alias 'General Kleber', an Austrian Jew from 
Bukovina, who had gone over to the Bolsheviks as a POW in Russia. He, 
like many such comrades, would be shot on Stalin's orders on his return to 
Russia. 

The courage of the men was not in doubt. They lived in squalid 
conditions and were subject to ferocious discipline, including executions, for 
the slightest offence. They fought with desperate courage. At the siege of 
Madrid in November 1936, for example, the British battalion lost one third 
of its effectives. At the Jarama, the same unit suffered 375 casualties out of 
600 men. 3 Worst of all, the Brigades were used to suppress the communists' 
erstwhile socialist and anarchist allies by brute force. 

By the end of 1938, the Kremlin agreed to pull the Brigades out. About 
12,000 departed, leaving some 6,000 Germans with nowhere to go. A 
farewell parade in Barcelona on 15 November, held under portraits of 
Negrin, Azana, and Stalin, was addressed by 'La Pasionaria': 

You are history ... You are legend ... We will not forget you. And when the 
olive tree of peace puts forth its leaves again, and mingles them with the 
laurels of a victorious Spanish Republic ... come back! 4 

Thanks to later developments, when the Western powers adopted the 
anti-Fascist cause, the career of the International Brigades in Spain attracted 
much favourable publicity. In fact, they were always outnumbered by the 
foreigners fighting for Franco. The latter included some Fascist regulars, 
some idealistic volunteers, and some, like the Irish Brigade of General 
O'Duffy, blatant adventurers. To see the overall picture, one has to compare 
the recruits raised by the Communists in 1936-7 with those attracted by the 
Fascists both in Spain and in the Second World War [lettland]. 


Franco's victory over 'the Spanish people', as his opponents put it, was 




frequently attributed to his superior armaments and foreign help. But the truth 
was not so simple or so palatable. The 'Spanish people' were not all on one side, 
and neither were all of Spain's 'anti-democratic' forces. It is hard to say whether 
the Spanish Republic was more discomfited by its nationalist enemies or by the 
totalitarian elements within its own ranks. Franco could unite his supporters; the 
Republic's supporters could not organize a united or effective democracy. 

For Spain, the Civil War was a tragic lesson in the fruits of fratricidal hatred. 
Estimates of casualties range from 400,000 to a million.- For Europe, it was yet 
another object lesson in the mechanisms whereby disciplined minorities can take 
control of countries which let them breed. Also, since Western sympathies were 
strongly behind the defeated Republic, it greatly magnified fears of a general 
fascist menace. By the same token, it diminished fears of the 'Red Bogey'. 
Thanks to Franco's unwelcome success, public opinion in the Western 
democracies entered the 'anti-fascist' mode which was to characterize its 
priorities for the duration. Franco strengthened the West's resolve to stand up to 
Hitler and Mussolini, whilst lowering its sensitivity to Stalin. After March 1939 
it was hard for any politician in the West to argue that communism was as great a 
menace as fascism. 


FARAON 

General Franco's mausoleum, at Cuel de Moros in the Valley of the Fallen 
near Madrid, was built after his victory in 1939. It consists of a grandiose 
underground basilica, larger than the nave of St Peter's, which is approached 
through a tunnel hewn through the granite and lined with the tombs of the 
Civil War dead. On the exterior it is surmounted by 'the largest Christian 
symbol ever erected'-a stone cross 492 ft high and weighing 181,740 tons. 1 
It was constructed by the slave labour of ex-POWs, branded with the letter 
'T' for trabajador or 'worker', who toiled for two decades between the 
work-site, the quarries, and compulsory church services in the nearby 
Escorial. They were officially employed by the 'Board for the Redemption 
of Penalties through Labour'-a name reminiscent of Nazi slogans. Visiting 
the site in 1940, a Nazi officer was said to have remarked, 'Who does 
[Franco] think he is-a new Pharaoh?' 





Ironically enough, Franco's victory came too late to arrest the general drift of 
events. If fascism had triumphed in Spain in 1937 or 1938, it is conceivable that 
the West would have been aroused to the danger in time to nip Hitler in the bud. 
It is conceivable that the whole sorry story of appeasement could have been 
avoided. As it was, in the three years that the Civil War in Spain dragged on, the 
dictators grew from strength to strength, and the chance for collective security 
was missed. 

'Collective security' was one of several abortive brain-children of the Western 
Powers, especially of the British, who were past masters at getting somebody 
else to do the fighting for them. Discussions went back to late 1933 when Hitler 
first pulled Germany out of the League of Nations. Before then, since the Soviet 
Union did not impinge on the West directly, Western anxieties had remained low. 
But the prospect of Nazi Germany on the loose in central Europe brought the 
danger rather nearer home. The obvious solution was for London and Paris to 
revive the strategic triangle of the Great War, and to recruit the Soviet Union as a 
counterweight to Germany. It was a move which the British in particular had 
been hoping to make since 1917. There was something of a public-relations 
problem, of course, in that Western politicians had been given to bad-mouthing 
Soviet communism; but it was not beyond the ingenuity of diplomats to explain 
that the Soviet regime was now entering a constructive phase, or that Stalin was 
more democratic than Lenin and Trotsky. Hence, in the middle of the most 
enormous campaigns of mass killing in European history, Stalin was made 
respectable and brought into the fold of the peaceful nations. Hitler's 
representative walked out of the League on 14 October 1933; Stalin's 
representative, Maxim Litvinov, moved in on 18 September 1934. 

From Stalin's point of view, rapprochement with the West offered several 
advantages. It would increase trade, and with it the import of technology. It 
would improve the USSR's image, whilst keeping the Nazis guessing. It would 
give Moscow's loyal communist parties abroad the chance to win acceptance 
and, by entering the Popular Fronts-as in Spain-to penetrate democratic 
parliaments and unions. Again there was a public-relations problem, since the 
Stalinists were given to calling democratic politicians everything from 
'bourgeois exploiters' to 'lackeys of international imperialism'; but this did not 



mean that Stalin had to abandon his discreet relations with Berlin, or the 
possibility of an eventual deal with Hitler. For the time being, he could keep all 
options open. 

In the years that followed, the Nazis reacted to the rumblings of the West 
with thinly disguised contempt. Their every step spelled disaster for the 
Versailles settlement. In July 1934 they almost brought off a coup in Austria, 
where they murdered the Chancellor, Dr Engelbert Dolfuss, whose Fatherland 
Front had organized a one-party but anti-Nazi state. In 1935 they celebrated the 
Saarland's accession to the Reich, through a plebiscite envisaged by the Treaty, 
then promptly reintroduced conscription, reconstituted the Luftwaffe, and 
renounced the disarmament clauses. In March 1936 they openly defied the 
Treaty by reoccu-pying the demilitarized zone in the Rhineland. In 1937 they 
pulled out of the British-backed Non-intervention Committee that was trying to 
keep foreign forces out of Spain, and signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Italy. 
In March 1938 Hitler engineered the Anschluss or 'merger' with Austria, 
proclaimed the Greater German Reich, and drove to Vienna in triumph (see 
Appendix III, p. 1323). 

Throughout this period Hitler was boasting of, and exaggerating, the scale of 
German rearmament. He kept quiet about the fact that he had already told his 
staff to prepare for war. [hossbach] This does not mean that he had prepared a 
timetable for the events which ensued; on the contrary, the major conflict for 
which German industrialists and generals were preparing was not envisaged 
before 1942. In the mean time Hitler would be engaged in the tactics of bluff and 
threat, in what has aptly been called the policy of 'peaceful aggression'. He felt 
that he could get what he wanted either without war or at most by localized 
conflict. To this end, in the spring of 1938 he began to make noises about the 
intolerable oppression of Germans in the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia. By 
that time the Western leaders could not fail to notice that Nazi Germany was 
bent on expansion, and that collective security was not producing concrete 
results. So, at the instigation of the new British Prime Minister, Neville 
Chamberlain, they embarked on appeasement. Chamberlain was acutely aware 
that renewed war in Europe would undermine Britain's fragile economic 
recovery and her imperial position overseas. 

Appeasement, despite its later reputation, need not necessarily have been a 
policy of abject surrender. It contained elements both of realism and of 
magnanimity; certainly, in the form that favoured negotiations with Germany, it 



rejected the cynicism revealed in earlier Franco-British dealings with Italy. As 
Chamberlain well knew, the Hoare-Laval Pact of December 1935, which simply 
sought to acquiesce in the Italian attack on Abyssinia, had been disowned both in 
London and Paris, and had led to the downfall of its inventors. What is more, 
twenty years after the Great War, liberal opinion largely accepted that German 
grievances over their minorities in Eastern Europe deserved discussion. Many 
also agreed with the MacDonald Plan of 1933, which had proposed a balance of 
armaments in Europe in place of the indefinite prolongation of Allied 
supremacy. The generals advised that there were only two ways of effective 
Allied intervention against eventual German aggression in the East. Yet co¬ 
operation with Stalin's Red Army was fraught with dangers; and direct action 
against Germany in the West could only be undertaken by starting the full-scale 
war whose avoidance was so heartily desired. All in all, it was not dishonourable 
for Chamberlain to seek out 'Herr Hitler' in Germany, or to seek a resolution of 
the Sudeten question. It was not the fact of negotiation that was at fault, only the 
skills and priorities of the negotiators. Chamberlain went as a lamb into the 
lion's den, woefully ignorant of the 'faraway country ' whose fate hung in the 
balance. Nor should one imagine that the history of appeasement was confined 
to the policy of the Western Powers towards Hitler. It has an even longer chapter 
in their relations at a slightly later date with Stalin. Democratic governments 
who neglect the moral fundamentals negotiate with dictators at their peril.- 

The Munich Crisis, as it came to be called, unfolded in September 1938 on 
terms set by Hitler and never seriously challenged. It was concerned with 
Germany's designs on France's ally Czechoslovakia. Yet France took a back 
seat; the Czechoslovak government was excluded from the main discussions; 
and no thought was given to keeping Czechoslovakia's defences viable. The 
negotiations were supposed to draw a line on German expansion to the East. Yet 
they proceeded without the participation of the two most interested parties, 
namely Poland and the USSR. They were supposed to impress on Hitler the risk 
he was running. Yet the Western negotiators did not lay their strongest cards on 
the table. As Hitler rightly sensed, the more outrageous aspects of his 
contentions were not going to be tested. This, plus Chamberlain's limitless 
gullibility, determined the outcome. 'In spite of the hardness and ruthlessness of 
his face,' Chamberlain mused of Hitler, 'I got the impression that here was a man 
who could be relied on.'-

HOSSBACH 


On 5 November 1937, from 4.15 to 8.30 p.m., a conference was held in the 
Reich Chancellery in Berlin. It was attended by a group of leading German 
dignitaries, including Goering, Neurath, and Raeder, and was addressed by 
Hitler on the subject of 'opportunities for the development of our position in 
the field of foreign affairs. 5 The contents of his speech, the Fiihrer 
melodramatically announced, were, in the event of his death, to be regarded 
as his last testament. They are known from a memorandum written up by 
Hossbach, the man who took the minutes: 

The aim of German policy was to secure and preserve the Volksmasse, the 
racial community and to enlarge it. It was a question of space ... German 
policy had to reckon with two hate-inspired antagonists, Britain and France, 
to whom a German colossus ... was a thorn in the flesh. 

Germany's problem could only be solved by means of force, and this was 
never without risk ... There still remain the questions of 'when' and 'how'. 
In this matter, there were three cases to be dealt with: 

Case 1: the period 1943-5. After this date only a change for the 
worse, from our point of view, could be expected ... If the Fiihrer 
was still living, it was his unalterable determination to resolve 
Germany's problem of space by 1943-5 at the latest. 

Case 2: If internal strife in France ... should absorb the French 
completely, then the time for action against the Czechs had come. 

Case 3: If France is so ambivalent in war with another state that she 
cannot proceed against Germany ... our first objective, if embroiled 
in war, must be to overthrow Czechoslovakia and Austria 
simultaneously ... 

Poland-with Russia at her rear will have little inclination to engage 


Military intervention by Russia was, in view of Japan's attitude, more 
than doubtful... 



It was to be assumed that Britain-herself at war with Italy-would 

decide not to act against Germany ... 1 

The Hossbach Memorandum has featured more than any other document in 
controversies over the origins of the Second World War. It was produced by 
Allied prosecutors at the Nuremberg Trial, and was used to accuse Goering 
and others for their part in planning the war 1939-45. However, the 
significance of the Memorandum was greatly deflated when a British 
historian demonstrated that the Memorandum did not support the views of 
the Allied prosecutors at Nuremberg. On the contrary, it showed that in 
November 1937 the Nazis had no concrete plans for war, and that Hitler had 
no clear assessment of the developing situation. It showed the Fiihrer ranting 
rather vaguely about the possibility of a very limited war sometime before 
1943-5: 

Hitler's exposition was in large part day-dreaming ... He did not reveal his 
innermost thoughts ... The memorandum tells us what we know already, that 
Hitler (like every other German statesman) intended to become the dominant 
Power in Europe. It also tells us that he speculated how this might happen. 
His speculations were mistaken. They bear hardly any relation to the actual 
outbreak of war in 1939. A racing tipster who only reached Hitler's level of 
accuracy would not do well for his clients .. . 2 

A. J. P. Taylor's analysis was all the more surprising since it came from a 
historian noted for his germanophobia. 

Outraged critics denounced Taylor's alleged disregard for 'historical 
context' and for the dynamics of Nazi expansionism. In mid-December 
1937, they insisted, the German Army's directives were changed to envisage 
military aggression against Austria and Czechoslovakia. They took this 
change as justification for their interpretation of the Memorandum, and the 
conference, as marking 'the point where the expansion of the Third Reich 
ceased to be latent and became explicit'. 3 They failed to notice that German 
military aggression against Austria and Czechoslovakia did not materialize 
any more than any of the Fiihrer's other faulty scenarios. 

In effect, by overturning the 'almost universal view that Hitler planned 
the Second World War', Taylor was wrongly accused of trying to absolve 
Hitler from blame. What Taylor successfully demonstrated was the strange 



combination in the Fiihrer's make-up of a general aggressive intent and an 
inability to formulate systematic war plans. 

Almost thirty years later, one of the striking features of the debate about 
the origins of the Second World War may be seen in the absence of any 
mention of Stalin, or of the dynamic interplay of German and Soviet policy. 
All the participants, including Taylor, confined themselves to a discussion of 
Germany's intentions. None thought it worthwhile to comment on the 
intentions of the USSR. Historians were faced with the locked doors of 
Soviet archives. If a Soviet equivalent of the Hossbach memorandum exists, 
it has never yet seen the light of day. There is no way of knowing whether 
Stalin did or did not speculate about war in a similar way to Hitler. So, in the 
absence of documentary evidence about Stalin's intentions, most 
commentators have preferred to assume that there is nothing to discuss. 

The long tradition of documentary-history writing, therefore, has 
fostered two opposite extremes. One is to say, in effect: if no documents can 
be examined, then nothing happened. The other view, well expressed in 
Taylor's Law' as formulated by Taylor's detractors, says: documents do not 
signify anything. Both extremes are equally pernicious. 


Chamberlain made three visits to Germany. At Berchtesgaden, on 15 
September, he received a demand from Hitler for the secession of the 
Sudetenland-positively 'the Fiihrer's last demand'. He promised to have it 
examined. At Godesberg, on the 23rd, he was faced by an unexpected ultimatum 
for the evacuation and annexation of the Sudetenland within five days. This was 
rejected by the British Cabinet, and by all concerned. France and Germany 
began to mobilize. At Munich, on 29-30 September, Chamberlain met the 
Fiihrer for the final confrontation in the company of Daladier and of Mussolini, 
who had suggested the meeting. He handed over a memorandum accepting the 
substance of the (unacceptable) Godesberg ultimatum. With the help of his 
distinguished colleagues, he then gave an ultimatum to the Czechs, huddled in an 
adjoining room, pressing them to accept the unacceptable themselves or to pay 
for the consequences. His final contribution was to underline the Allied 
guarantee of a rump Czechoslovakian state, shorn of its magnificent frontier 
fortifications, and to draft a declaration on Anglo-German friendship. He 
alighted from his plane waving a paper which he claimed to bring 'Peace in our 




time'. He did so in the same spirit which underlay the British Foreign Office's 
advice to the England football team that same year-to give the Nazi salute at 
the start of their match against Germany in Berlin. 

Chamberlain's three rounds with Hitler must qualify as one of the most 
degrading capitulations in history. Under pressure from the ruthless, the clueless 
combined with the spineless to achieve the worthless. Chamberlain had no need 
to concede any part of the Fiihrer's demands without making cast-iron 
arrangements for Czechoslovakia's security; but he did. Benes, the 
Czechoslovak President, had no right to sign away his country's integrity with 
nothing more than a personal protest; but he did. The outcome was to be 
summarized by Churchill in the House of Commons: 

'£1 was demanded at the pistol's point. When it was given, £2 was demanded at the pistol's point. Finally 
the Dictator consented to take £1.17s. 6d. and the rest in promises of goodwill for the future ... We have 
suffered a defeat without a war.'- 


Elsewhere, Churchill wrote that Britain had a choice 'between shame and war'; 
'we have chosen shame, and we will get war'. Within six months the remnant of 
Czechoslovakia disintegrated, and Hitler entered Prague. 

Munich undoubtedly marked the crucial psychological moment in inter-war 
diplomacy. It did not yet make war inevitable; what it did do was to sow the 
confusion in which two fatal assumptions were born. First, it convinced Hitler, 
and probably Stalin too, that further peaceful aggression would bring further 
cost-free dividends. Secondly, it created the impression in the West that talking 
to the Nazis had been a mistake. In the next round of the game, where the map 
ensured that Poland would be. threatened, Munich ensured that Hitler and Stalin 
would seek to aggress by peaceful methods; that the West would seek to deter 
without negotiating; and that the Poles would seek to avoid the fate of 
Czechoslovakia at all costs. This was the deadly recipe. 

In any number of European history books, 1939 is the year when 'the world 
went again to war', or words to that effect. In all chronologies except those once 
published in the USSR, it marks the 'outbreak of the Second World War'. This 
only proves how self-centred Europeans can be. War had been on the march in 
the world for eight years past. The Japanese had invaded Manchuria in 1931, and 
had been warring in central China since 1937. From August 1938 they were 
embroiled in fighting on the Mongolian frontier against the Soviet Red Army. As 


part of this conflict, Japan had joined Germany and Italy as one of the Axis 
Powers. What happened in 1939, therefore, was simply the addition of Europe to 
the existing theatres of war. It gave a second, European dimension to campaigns 
which hitherto were summarized, to quote the Japanese slogan, as 'Asia for the 
Asiatics'. In this sense, it turned a regional war into a global one. It has also been 
called 'Hitler's War'. This too is inaccurate. 

By 1939 general rearmament was greatly adding to the strains. All the 
powers were rearming. Two years before, on Churchill's insistence, Britain had 
taken the decision to expand and to re-equip the RAF. This was the decision 
which would ensure her survival. At the same time France had created a new 
Ministry of Defence, and had nationalized the great Schneider-Creusot concern. 
This was a sign that European governments were preparing for a protracted 
conflict in which industrial strength would be every bit as decisive as trained 
men. On this score, specialist studies indicated the dramatic changes which had 
occurred in the last decade.

Estimates no doubt varied. But the British figures underlined several stark facts. 
The totalitarian powers had suffered from the Depression much less than the 
Western democracies had. Their military expenditure was twice as great as that 
of all the Western Powers put together. Their 'relative war potential'-which 
was a calculation based on the ability to translate industrial strength into military 
power through indices such as machine-tool levels-was roughly equal, and was 
separately equivalent to that of Britain and France combined. Italy hardly 
entered the reckoning. The RWP of Japan, was put, somewhat derisively at 3.5 
per cent. All the other countries in the world added up to barely 10 per cent. 

It took no genius to draw the conclusions: Stalin and Hitler were already in 
possession of war machines that far outstripped anything else in Europe. If the 
USA remained aloof, the Western Powers would be hard pressed to contain 
either Stalin or Hitler. If Stalin and Hitler joined forces, the West would be 
powerless to stop them. All eyes were, or should have been, on Stalin and Hitler, 
and on the unhappy countries trapped between them. Everything else was 





secondary. 

Stalin's intentions in 1939 were governed by factors which are not always 
fully discussed. Professional historians, since they never gained access to the 
documentation, have often pretended that the subject does not exist. But it is not 
impossible to reconstruct its outlines. Generally speaking, the internal revolution 
of the USSR was reaching a plateau of relative stability, and the Vozhd' could 
look forward with confidence to more active foreign involvement. The most 
vulnerable years of the first Five-Year Plans and Collectivization had been 
passed; the Great Terror was drawing to a close; and a rearmed Red Army could 
already be rated as one of Europe's mightiest formations. However, two 
important inhibitions remained. The last phase of the Purges, which had been 
directed against the officer corps, was still incomplete; in 1939 the killing of the 
old military cadres was still in progress. And the Red Army was still engaged 
against the Japanese in Mongolia. Stalin, forever cautious, calculating, and 
secretive, was unlikely to commit himself to a major adventure in Europe until 
the new army cadres were trained and the Japanese conflict had been resolved. 
His obvious objective in the first instance was to lure Germany into a war with 
the Western Powers, whilst the USSR garnered its strength.- 

Hitler's position was not so cramped. He had recently gained full control of 
the Wehrmacht, and he had no military commitments. He now held the offices of 
both War Minister and Commander-in-Chief. He had cut out all opposition in the 
General Staff; and after the dismissal of Dr Schacht had taken direct control of 
German industry. His protege in Spain was poised for victory, and his own 
triumph at Munich had wrecked the defence plans of his Eastern neighbours. His 
minions were stirring up trouble all along the line-in Klajpeda (Memel) in 
Lithuania, in the Free City of Danzig, in Poland's German community, and in 
Slovakia, where a local nationalist movement was looking to Berlin for 
assistance. He had no definite war plans for the coming season; but as he pored 
over the outspread map in front of the plate-glass window of the 'Eagle's Nest' 
at Berchtesgaden, it must have seemed that Europe was full of opportunities. On 
which miserable prey would the Eagle choose to swoop? 

Early in 1939 Hitler's preference was still for some sort of deal with Poland. 
Three weeks after Munich he had called the Polish Ambassador to 
Berchtesgaden and had outlined the possibilities. It was the culmination of long 
preparations which had taken Goring on several hunting trips to the Polish 
forests, and which had led communist propaganda to assume that a Nazi-Polish 


alliance was already in existence.- Hitler's proposals centred on the idea that if 
the Poles would cede their rights in Danzig, and permit the building of the 
Berlin-Konigsberg autobahn across Polish territory, they could join in a 
favourable political and economic association directed against the Soviet Union. 
The unspoken threat did not have to be spelled out. If the Poles were foolish 
enough to refuse, then Hitler would take Danzig anyhow and might seek a 
political and economic realignment with the USSR, directed against Poland. One 
has to assume that Hitler's well-known racial and ideological prejudices would 
have led him to expect an early acceptance. After all, since the Polish colonels 
had to contend with the largest Jewish community in Europe, and since Poland 
was fiercely anti-communist, it must have seemed to him that Poland and Nazi 
Germany were natural partners. 

Unfortunately, neither Hider nor those who advised him knew much about 
Poland's mettle. They did not know that Polish nationalism was every bit as 
hostile to Germany as to Russia. They did not know that Polish colonels could 
feel defensive about their handling of the Jewish Question, especially when 
foreigners interfered. Above all, they did not understand that the response of 
Marshal Pilsudski's heirs would be completely different from that of 
Chamberlain and Benes. The colonels were not going to bow and scrape to an 
ex-Austrian ex-corporal. Their instinct was to fight, and to go down fighting. 
Every single Polish official who had to deal with Nazi and Soviet threats in 1939 
had been reared on the Marshal's moral testament: 'To be defeated, but not to 
surrender, that is victory.'- 

So the Fiihrer was kept kicking his heels. The weeks passed; Poland 
pointedly opened 'trade and friendship talks' with the USSR; Berlin's proposals 
were left unanswered. On 21 March 1939, a week after the collapse of 
Czechoslovakia, the Polish Ambassador was called in again and told that the 
Fiihrer was furious at the lack of progress. On 28 March Germany renounced the 
non-aggression pact with Poland. Nazi propaganda switched to the Danzig 
problem, and complained of the intolerable oppression of the German minority 
in Poland. On 31 March Poland received from Great Britain an unsolicited 
Guarantee of its independence. Hitler's response, on 3 April, was to issue 
confidential directives for planning the seizure of Danzig and for possible war 
with Poland, [susanin] 

In the mean time, prize after prize fell into the Fiihrer's lap. On 10 March the 
autonomous Slovak Government was declared deposed by the central 


Czechoslovak authorities in Prague; and the offended Slovak leader, Father Tiso, 
appealed to the Fiihrer for protection. Then the Czechoslovak President begged 
for an interview at Berchtesgaden. After a terrible drubbing before the plate- 
glass window, and one of Hitler's most histrionic performances, during which 
the unconscious visitor had to be revived by injections, President Hacha meekly 
accepted that the break-up of his country was unavoidable. Bohemia and 
Moravia were to be turned into a Nazi Protectorate; Slovakia was to be a 
sovereign republic; Sub-Carpathian Ruthenia was to be ceded to Hungary. Hitler 
drove in triumph into Prague, as he had driven to Vienna, without a shot being 
fired. On the 21st German troops seized Lithuanian Memel. This was the point at 
which Chamberlain finally grasped the truth that Hitler was not'a man of his 
word'. The British Guarantee of Poland, an act of bluff taken from a position of 
weakness, was the product of his belated realization. To cap it all, the 
Hungarians seized Ruthenia without anyone's permission. On Good Friday, 2 
April, the Italian army invaded Albania. Europe was already at war. 


SUSANIN 

On 26 February 1939 the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow resounded to a lavish 
revival of Russia's most popular opera. Glinka's A Life for the Tsar (1836) 
had lain dormant since the Bolshevik Revolution; and a brief production of it 
in 1924, under the title of For Hammer and Sickle, had not prospered. But 
re-equipped with a politically correct libretto and yet another title, Ivan 
Susanin, it could now recover the vast popularity of pre-revolutionary 
decades. 1 It was the clearest sign that the Party's line had shifted to embrace 
traditional Russian nationalism. 

Glinka's opera had been an ideological creature from the start. Described 
as a 'patriotic, heroic-tragic opera', it had been composed in the aftermath of 
the Polish Rising of 1830-1, reflecting the composer's 'determination to 
embody state ideology in symbolic sound'. 2 The libretto is set in the year 
1613, at the moment when the founder of the Romanov dynasty was 
struggling to bring order from the chaos of the Time of Troubles (see p. 
557). In the best tradition of 'rescue opera', it tells the tale of a good Russian 
peasant, Susanin, who saves the Tsar from the clutches of the dastardly 




Polish invaders. In this, it closely follows a patriotic textbook, Russian 
History for the Purposes of Upbringing (1817), compiled by the composer's 
brother. 

Glinka's aesthetic concept was to use the dichotomy of Russian heroes 
and Polish villains throughout the spectacle. There are two sets of leading 
characters, two alternating choruses-Polish and Russian: two contrasting 
scenographic and musical styles. The faceless Poles are characterized by 
excess, singing and dancing exclusively in a formal collective to the 
melodies of the polonez, the mazurka, and the krakowiak. The Russians sing 
either charming folk-songs or romantic lyrics in the fashionable Ttalo- 
Russian style'. Nothing is spared to stress the political message. 

After Susanin's murder, the epilogue reaches a climax with the scene of 
Mikhail Romanov's triumphant entry into Red Square. Here the music 
changes to that of a sacred 'hymn-march', the words to those of a super- 
patriotic anthem: 

Slav'sya, slav'sya, nash ruskiy Tsar', 

Gospodom danniy nam Tsar-gosudar. 

Da budet bessmyerten tvoy tsarskiy rod. 

Da im blagodenstvuyet russkiy narod. 

(Glory be to our Russian Tsar, | To our God-given Tsar-Ruler. | May thy 
imperial clan be deathless! | May the Russian nation grant them blessing.) 

In the 1939 production the anthem was duly modified: 

Slav'sya, Slav'sya ty Rus' moyal 
Slav'sya ty, russkaya nasha zemlyal 
Da budet vo veki vekov silna 
Lyubimaya nasha rodnaya strana. 

(Glory be to Thee, my Rus' | Glory to Thee our Russian land | May our 
beloved native country | For ever and ever be strong.) 

The power of opera harnessed to nationalism is most frequently discussed in 
relation to Wagner. But with Glinka the connection is still more explicit. 
Indeed, sensitivity to Russian nationalism determined where and when the 
opera could be staged. In Tsarist Russia it became the automatic choice for 
the opening night of each operatic season in Moscow and St Petersburg. By 



1879 it had attained its 500th performance. It was staged in Prague, in 
Czech, in 1866; in Riga, in Latvian, in 1878; and at the German Theatre in 
Posen, Prussia, in 1899. But it never found an audience in Warsaw or 
Cracow. Most significantly, in February 1940, on the first anniversary of its 
revival in Moscow, it received its premiere under Nazi auspices in Berlin. 


Faced with a specific commitment to Poland, the Western Powers now 
sought to put some practical measures into place. In April and May an inter- 
Allied mission visited Warsaw. It established a firm understanding that, in the 
event of a German attack on Poland, the task of the Polish army was to hold 
back the Wehrmacht whilst an Allied counter-attack was prepared in the West. 
General Gamelin was quite specific: on the fifteenth day after mobilization at the 
latest, 'le gros de nos forces', 'the bulk of our forces', would be thrown across 
the Franco-German frontier. Another military mission was sent to Moscow, to 
discuss cooperation with the Red Army. Long before they sailed on 5 August on 
a slow boat to Leningrad, in blissful ignorance of the main play, Hitler and Stalin 
had decided to settle the Polish Crisis on their own. 

A Nazi-Soviet rapprochement was in the offing from the first week of May, 
when one of Stalin's closest henchmen, Molotov, emerged as Commissar for 
Foreign Affairs. Molotov's Jewish predecessor, Litvinov, who had an English 
wife, Ivy, was closely connected with the West and with the ailing policy of 
collective security. His last throw, for an Anglo-Soviet defensive alliance, had 
fallen on stony ground. Molotov was appointed with a view to reactivating the 
line to Berlin. Direct negotiations began in Moscow in June under the cover of 
'trade talks'. 

Once Stalin and Hitler had cast their suspicions aside, and their 
representatives had began to talk, they must rapidly have realized the scale of the 
opportunity. Given the indecisions of the West, Poland was the only serious 
obstacle to the prospect of dividing up Eastern Europe between them. With such 
a glittering prize in view, neither Hitler nor Stalin can have worried too much 
about the later prospect of Russia and Germany fighting over the spoils. Nor can 
they have cared to guess the long-term reactions of the West. Given Stalin's 
blessing, Hitler reckoned that he could deal with Britain and France single- 
handed and greatly strengthen Germany in the process; and Stalin was more than 
content to let him try. Given Hitler's blessing, Stalin reckoned that he could 




clean up the states of Eastern Europe single-handed, and greatly strengthen the 
USSR in the process. They probably both believed that it was better to solve 
Europe's problems before the USA, whose present military expenditure was less 
than Great Britain's, was alerted to the dangers. The opportunity had to be 
grasped; it might not recur. One week after the British mission made its leisurely 
way to Moscow, Herr von Ribbentrop flew smartly in from Berlin. 

In those summer days, when the weather was as sunny as the political 
forecast was grim, Hider's ebullience grew. His rearmament record, which had 
increased the Wehrmacht's front-line divisions from 7 to 51 in three years, 
excelled that of the Kaiser's army in the decade before 1914. He felt sure that the 
West could be fooled as usual, that the ungrateful Poles could be punished in 
isolation. With the great Stalin thinking the same way as himself, he was ready 
for limited war, without knowing whether war would be needed. He had little 
inclination to listen to the whingeing Western diplomats, nor to those in his own 
camp, like Goring or Mussolini, who wanted to prolong the peace. At a military 
conference on 23 May he had ranted on about Lebensraum in the East and the 
inevitability of war sooner or later. On 14 June he had set a timetable for his 
generals to be ready in eight weeks' time. On 22 August, when the eight weeks 
were up, he told another conference at the Berghof that 'War is better now'. His 
notes ran: 'No pity-brutal attitude-might is right-greatest severity.'- 

The final piece of the preparations fell into place the very next day. On 23 
August the news broke from Moscow that those mortal enemies, Nazi Germany 
and the Soviet Union, had followed up their recent trade agreement with a pact 
of non-aggression. What is more (though no one outside Moscow or Berlin was 
to know for certain until the Nazi archives were captured six years later), the 
Ribbentrop-Molotov pact had been supplemented by a secret protocol: 

Moscow, 23 August 1939 

On the occasion of the Non-Aggression Pact between the German Reich and the 
USSR, the undersigned plenipotentiaries ... discussed the boundaries of their 
respective spheres of influence in Eastern Europe. These conversations led to the 
following conclusions: 

1. In the event of a territorial and political rearrangement in the areas belonging 
to the Baltic States (Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania), the northern 
boundary of Lithuania will form the boundary of the spheres of influence of 
Germany and the USSR. In this connection, the interest of Lithuania in the 


Vilna area is recognised by each party. 

2. In the event of a territorial and political rearrangement of the areas belonging 
to the Polish state, the spheres of influence of Germany and the USSR shall be 
bounded approximately by the line of the rivers Vistula, Narew, and San. The 
question of whether the interests of both parties make desirable the 
maintenance of an independent Polish State, and how such a state should be 
bounded, can be definitely determined in the course of further political 
developments. In any event, both Governments will resolve this question by 
means of a friendly agreement. 

3. With regard to Southeastern Europe, attention is called by the Soviet side to 
its interest in Bessarabia. The German side declares its disinterest in these 
areas. 

4. This protocol shall be treated by both parties as strictly secret. 

For the Gov't of the German Reich Plenipotentiary of the Gov't of the USSR 

'J. Von Ribbentrop' 'V. Molotov ^ 1 


Hitler and Stalin had carved up Eastern Europe into spheres of influence. Their 
so-called 'pact of non-aggression' was the perfect blueprint for aggression. 

Neither party had a good word for the Western Powers. Ribbentrop was 
confident that Germany could deal with the French army. As for Great Britain, 
The Reich Foreign Minister stated that ... England was weak and wanted others 
to fight for its presumptuous claim to world domination. Herr Stalin eagerly 
concurred ... [but he] further expressed the opinion that England, despite its 
weakness, would wage war craftily and stubbornly.'- 

The German-Soviet pact is often described as Hitler's licence for war. This 
is true, but it is only half the story, for the pact was equally Stalin's licence for 
war. From the moment the ink was dry, each of the signatories was free to assault 
its neighbours without hindrance from the other. Which is exactly what both of 
them did. 

The Wehrmacht was due to march on 24 August; but the Fiihrer, in one of his 
fits of nerves, failed to give the final order. He was also curious to see if a 
second Munich was possible. The Nazi press was publishing stories about Poles 
castrating Germans; and Goring was urging him to contact London. On the 25th 
the British Ambassador was summoned and handed a set of unlikely proposals. 
A Swedish friend of Goring's was sent to talk directly with Whitehall. But then 
Chamberlain missed his cue by guaranteeing Poland's independence once more 


in a formal Anglo-Polish Treaty. After that, the diplomats were wasting their 
time: there could be no second Munich. Hitler issued Directive No. 1 for the 
conduct of war against Poland at 1 p.m. on the 31st. [genocide] 

The outbreak of the Polish campaign was stage-managed in best Nazi style. 
There was no declaration of war. Instead, SS Sturmbann fiihrer Alfred Helmut 
Naujocks received orders to round up a detachment of convicts, code-named 
Konserven or 'Tin Cans', and to take them to a German radio station at Gleiwitz 
in Silesia close to the Polish frontier. The studio was duly stormed by men 
dressed in Polish uniforms, and a rousing Polish chorus was broadcast to the 
sound of pistol shots. Once outside, the Tin Cans were mown down by the 
machine-guns of their SS minders, and their blood-soaked bodies were dumped 
where they would soon be found by the local police. The first casualties of the 
campaign were German convicts killed by German criminals. Before the night 
was out, the Nazi news service was announcing that the Polish Army had 
launched an unprovoked attack on the Third Reich.- 

The Second World War in Europe, 1939- 

1945 64 

The invasion of Poland which began on 1 September 1939 did not mark the start 
of fighting in Europe. It had been preceded by the German attack on Lithuania in 
March 1939 and by the Italian invasion of Albania in April. But it transformed a 
series of essentially local wars into the setting for world-wide conflict. By 
involving the USSR, which was already engaged against the Japanese in 
Mongolia, it established the link between the European and the Asian theatres of 
operations. In theory Japan belonged to the Nazi system of alliances, even when 
the Nazi-Soviet pact put a clamp on the anti-Comintern club. But the fact that 
Japan, the USSR, Poland, Germany, and the Western Powers were all enmeshed 
in the web of conflict makes the best argument for contending that a Second 
World War had really begun. 

The Red Army's role in Poland remained uncertain until the confrontation 
with Japan was resolved. The decisive Soviet victory at Khalkin-gol on 28 
August, achieved by the armour of an unknown general called Zhukov, seems to 
have been the precondition for an active Soviet policy in Europe. It was perhaps 
no accident that Stalin delayed his entry into Poland until a truce was signed in 


Mongolia on 15 September, and Zhukov's divisions could return across the 
Urals.- 

The German-Soviet Pact had created a new geopolitical framework in 
Europe. The Great Triangle was now turned round, with the Western Powers 
(Britain, France, and Canada) facing a combination of the Centre and the East 
(see Appendix III, p. 1312). The Triangle was not quite complete, however, since 
the Western Powers and the USSR both avoided direct confrontation. This meant 
that the West would close its eyes to Stalin's aggressions, so long as Stalin would 
limit his anti-Western activities to propaganda and to logistical support for 
Germany.- None the less, the German-Soviet Pact transformed the European 
scene. It enabled Germany and the USSR to destroy Poland and to re-establish 
the common frontier which had existed throughout the nineteenth century. After 
that, it permitted them to clear away all the minor states which cluttered their 
path. In the slightly longer term, it gave Hider the chance to attack the West with 
Stalin's support and encouragement. 


















Map 26. 

Europe during the Second World War, 1939-1945 

In later years the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact was to be justified on the 
grounds that it gave the Soviet Union time to construct its defences. Given what 
happened two years later, the argument looks plausible; but this could be yet 
another classic case of reading history backwards. In 1939 there was indeed a 
possibility that Hitler would turn on the USSR after defeating the West; but this 
was only one contingency, and not necessarily the most likely or the most 
immediate one. At least three other scenarios had to be considered. One was the 
possibility that Germany would be defeated in the West, as in 1918. Another was 
the prospect that Germany and the West would fight each other to a bloody 
stalemate, after which the USSR could emerge as the arbiter of Europe without 
firing a shot. This was Goebbels's view of the Soviet game. 'Moscow intends to 
keep out of the war until Europe is ... bled white,' he noted. 'Then Stalin will 
move to bolshevize Europe and impose his own rule.'- A third possibility was 
that Stalin would use the interval of Hitler's western war to prepare and launch 
an offensive of his own. 

Thanks to the closure of the relevant Soviet archives, historical knowledge 
on these matters remains tentative. But two indications are important. First, there 
is very little evidence to show that the Red Army gave priority after August 1939 
to preparing defence in depth. On the contrary, it favoured a theory of 
revolutionary attack. Stalin had often stressed that communism was not the same 
as pacifism; speaking to cadets in 1938, he stressed that the Soviet state would 
take the military initiative whenever required. Secondly, studies of the Red 
Army's dispositions in the early summer of 1941 suggest that the two previous 
years had been spent creating a distinctly offensive posture.- They go a long 
way to explaining the disaster which then overtook it (see below). In that case, 
one would have to conclude that Stalin entered his pact with the Nazis, not to 
win time for defence, but to outplay Hitler in the game of calculated

aggression.- 

What is certain is that the German-Soviet Pact led Europe into events which 
no one could have foreseen. In the first phase, 1939-41, whilst the pact still held, 
Nazi and Soviet adventures proceeded apace in each of their designated spheres. 
The Red Army met with varied fortunes; but the Wehrmacht's stunning conquest 
of Western Europe came more swiftly than the most starry-eyed German general 
could have imagined. In the second phase, 1941-3, the Nazi war-machine was 


thrown into the East. The German-Soviet war constituted the central military 
contest whereby Europe's fate would be decided. The Western Powers, reduced 
to the control of one embattled island, could only exert a peripheral influence. In 
the final phase, 1943-5, the Soviet Army in the East combined with growing 
British and American forces in the West to ensure Germany's downfall. 

The Nazi-Soviet Partnership (September 1939-June 1941). Thanks to the 
secret protocols of the German-Soviet pact, many participants in the opening 
campaign of the Second World War entered the fray on false premisses. The 
Western Powers thought that they had guaranteed an ally under threat from Nazi 
aggression; in fact, they had guaranteed an ally which was to be attacked by the 
Soviet Union as well as the Third Reich. The Poles thought that their task was to 
hold off the German advance for fifteen days until the French crossed the 
German frontier in the West; in feet, they faced the impossible task of holding 
off both the Wehrmacht and the Red Army on their own. The French launched 
no offensive; the British limited their assistance to dropping leaflets over Berlin. 

In this constellation Poland's invaders enjoyed every possible advantage. The 
German Command possessed roughly the same 60 divisions as its Polish 
adversary, but, thanks to the occupation of Czechoslovakia, it had Poland 
surrounded from three sides at once. It enjoyed a decisive superiority, both in 
mechanical forces and in air power, which would inflict a hundred Guernicas on 
Poland in the opening days. Above all, it could confidently launch its Panzer 
divisions deep into Polish territory, secure in the knowledge that its Soviet 
partners would take any Polish counter-measures in the rear. The Soviet 
Command held the trump card. Declining any joint timetable with the Germans, 
the Soviet generals could watch and wait until Poland was stretched on the 
German rack before marching in to deliver the coup de grace. In the Polish 
campaign of September 1939, therefore, military operations were overshadowed 
by politics and treachery. The Poles did their duty, fighting on for five weeks 
against hopeless odds. The Western Powers declared war on Germany, but 
declined to confront the Soviet Union, even when Soviet complicity became 
evident. Nor did they intervene in the fighting. The British could not, and the 
French would not. French mobilization procedures had been designed to prepare 
for a long war: they required all front-line divisions to be stripped down to the 
status of temporary cadres, during a long period of reorganization which 
precluded any immediate offensive operations. So Hitler and Stalin had 
everything their own way. 



At dawn on 1 September, German columns stormed into Poland from the 
north, the west, and the south. The Polish defence lines close to the frontier were 
circumvented. Warsaw was surrounded from the 9th. The civilian population 
was subjected to unprecedented bombardments. A German fifth column was 
operating behind the lines. Nazi Einsatzgruppen appeared in the rear, shooting 
resisters, stragglers, and Jews. Screaming Stuka dive-bombers destroyed 
railways, roads, and bridges, together with the refugees that crammed them. 
Warsaw, half-reduced to rubble, dug in for a long siege. The Polish army 
regrouped in the south-east for the defence of Lwow, whilst mounting a 
determined counter-attack in the centre on the Bzura. On the 15th a Nazi 
communique falsely announced that Warsaw had fallen. (It held out for two 
more weeks.) But Stalin may have thought that he was losing out. The blow was 
struck on the 17th, when Red Army troops poured over the eastern frontier. They 
sowed total confusion by their own false communiques about saving Poland 
from the Nazis. In fact, they drove straight to the agreed demarcation line on the 
River Bug, and to the southern frontier with Romania and Hungary to seal it off. 
The Germans and Soviets held a joint victory parade in Brzesc (Brest-Litowsk) 
before fixing the details of their victory. 

The German-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Co-operation, and Demarcation 
signed on 28 September reached much further than the pact of five weeks before. 
It redrew the demarcation line, putting Lithuania into the Soviet sphere in 
exchange for a slice of central Poland. And it contained yet another secret 
protocol which envisaged joint action against Polish 'agitation'. These measures 
were put into place as Warsaw finally surrendered. The Polish Government had 
escaped into exile. Large numbers of Polish troops took to the woods, or fled 
abroad. The final capitulation took place on 4 October, the day when Hitler 
arrived in Warsaw to receive the salute of his admiring legions. Everything to the 
east of the Bug was taken by the Soviets. 

Hitler's thoughts at this juncture were recorded by his faithful propaganda 
chief: 

The Fuehrer's verdict on the Poles is damning. More like animals than human beings, completely primitive 
and amorphous. And a ruling class that is an unsatisfactory result of a mingling between the lower orders 
and an Aryan master-race. The Poles' dirtiness is unimaginable. Their capacity for intelligent judgement is 
absolutely nil... 

The Fuehrer has no intention of assimilating the Poles ... Had Henry the Lion conquered the East ... 
the result would certainly have been a strongly slavicised race of German mongrels. Better the present 
situation. Now we know the laws of racial heredity and can handle things accordingly.- 


The double occupation of Poland brought two laboratories of totalitarianism 
into being side by side. For two years the Nazi and Soviet vultures feasted on 
Poland's fallen body undisturbed. In the German zone the Western districts were 
annexed to the Reich, and subjected to an intense regime of racial screening and 
germanization. All other districts were thrown into a so-called General 
Government of Poland under SS and military rule. This 'Gestapoland', subject 
neither to Polish nor to German law, became the ultimate test-bed of Nazi 
ideology. It was the only part of occupied Europe where, in pursuit of their 
eastern Lebensraum, the Nazi planners had the time to apply their racial policies 
with full vigour to the whole population. After Himmler's first inspection, the 
aged and mentally handicapped were seized from the hospitals, orphanages were 
raided for boys and girls suitable for the stud programme of the Lebensborn 
organization;- and concentration camps were organized at Auschwitz and 
Majdanek to deal with the Resistance. In an act of cold-blooded genocide, the 
so-called AB-Aktion, some 15,000 Polish intellectuals, officials, politicians, and 
clergy were selected for shooting or for consignment to concentration camps. As 
from late 1939, Poland's large Jewish community was ordered into designated 
ghetto districts, which were then gradually walled, locked, and totally 
segregated; Jewish councils, supported by a Jewish police force, were recruited 
to run the ghettos under Nazi supervision. - [auschwitz] 

In the adjoining Soviet zone, phoney referenda were staged to justify the 
claim that 'western Byelorussia' and 'western Ukraine' had opted for annexation. 
This 'GPU-land', which remained cordoned off from the rest of the USSR, was 
scourged by the full force of the Stalinist terror. Some forty categories of people, 
from policemen to philatelists, were selected for instant arrest and deportation. 
By the summer of 1941 between 1 and 2 million individuals had been 
transported either to the Arctic camps or to forced exile in Central Asia. The 
Terror was directed not only at all former Polish state officials, down to village 
teachers and foresters, but equally at all communal organizations of 
Byelorussians, Ukrainians, and Jews. The peoples who had supposedly been 
'liberated from Polish rule' were scourged as mercilessly as everyone else. In an 
act of cold-blooded genocide, some 26,000 Polish prisoners of war-mainly 
reserve officers, and hence intellectuals, officials, politicians, and clergy-were 
taken from their camps and shot in a series of massacres known under the 
collective name of Katyn. On the frontier bridge over the Bug at Brest, people 
entering the USSR met others, including Jews, who were seeking haven in the 
Reich. 'Where on earth are you going?' exclaimed an SS-officer on one 


occasion; 'we are going to kill you.'- 

The full extent of co-operation between the SS and the NKVD in these years 
has never been properly established. The Nazi files went missing; and Soviet 
archives remained closed. Even so, a high-ranking Soviet liaison officer was 
attached to SS HQ in Cracow right up to 1941. Nazi and Soviet delegations 
attended joint conferences; prisoners were exchanged; Nazi and Soviet 
propaganda worked in unison, and at full blast. As from 24 August the Soviet 
press reversed its previous policy, and took to quoting the Volkischer Beobachter 
as a credible source of information. Pravda announced that 'German-Soviet 
friendship is now established forever'.- [katyo] 

The impotence of the Western Powers undoubtedly gave encouragement to 
Hitler and Stalin. What a French politician dubbed the drdle de guerre or 
'phoney war' was only droll for those not directly involved. In the 20 months 
after the fall of Poland, 13 European countries were due to be overrun-8 by 
Hider, 5 by Stalin. Stalin took the lead by sending the Red Army into Finland on 
30 November 1939. 

The 'Winter War' of 1939-40 revealed serious deficiencies in the Red Army, 
whilst testing the tolerance of the Western Powers to the limit. For five months, 
well-motivated Finnish troops held off the Soviet invader. In the early months 
they inflicted bloody slaughter on clumsy Soviet attempts to storm the 
Mannerheim Fine. Soviet tactics and equipment were made to look inferior, 
Soviet policy was condemned for blatant aggression. When the Feague of 
Nations expelled the USSR, the Western Powers could no longer pretend, as 
with Poland, that Stalin's depredations were somehow more legitimate than 
Hitler's. In the spring, as the Red Army prepared for an overwhelming assault, 
the British Government was obliged to consider Finnish pleas for aid and 
assistance via Narvik and the Fapland railway. There was even a scheme to 
bomb the Baku oilfields in retaliation for Soviet supplies to Germany. Squadrons 
of British bombers, repainted with the swastika emblem of the Finnish air force, 
were standing by when news of a Finno-Soviet Treaty saved Fondon from its 
dilemma. Finland was to remain independent and neutral, though forced to cede 
a large tract of eastern territory, in Karelia. The German General Staff can hardly 
have missed the implications about the USSR's apparent weakness. 

The Finnish campaign exposed the vulnerability of German interests in 
Scandinavia, notably in the Swedish iron ore exported via Narvik. Hitler struck 
on 9 April 1940. Denmark was quickly overrun, and Norway invaded shortly 


afterwards. An Allied expeditionary force sent to Narvik was repelled with 
heavy loss. This was the first occasion on which British intelligence chose to 
withhold life-saving information rather than betray their knowledge of the Nazis' 
Enigma Code, whose secrets had first been penetrated by the Poles.- 
Henceforth, Scandinavia lay firmly under German control. Denmark retained its 
King and government; Norway was handed over to a native collaborator, Vidkun 
Quisling; Sweden was to retain its neutrality, so long as the iron ore continued to 
flow. Here were signals that German policy in the West was to be incomparably 
more lenient than in the East. 


KATYN 

On 5 March 1940, Stalin signed an order authorizing the NKVD to shoot 
over 26,000 Allied prisoners-of-war. The prisoners, who had been captured 
during joint German-Soviet operations in Poland the previous September, 
were being held in three separate Soviet camps-at Kozielsk, Oshtakovo, 
and Starobielsk. They were nearly all Polish reserve officers-doctors, 
lawyers, professors, engineers, policemen, priests, and one woman-who 
had been separated out from a much larger pool of POWs in the USSR. They 
were driven in small groups to secret killing-grounds, bound and 
blindfolded, shot in the head, and buried in mass graves. The operation was 
concluded on 6 June. 

During those same months, in pursuance of a secret clause in the 
German-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Demarcation, the Nazi SS and 
Soviet NKVD were co-operating closely. Hidden from the outside world, 
both occupying powers conducted a series of parallel massacres and 
deportations. 2 Whilst the West was transfixed by the 'Phoney War', their 
Polish allies were being systematically and cynically murdered. 

In 1941, when the Nazi-Soviet Pact collapsed and Stalin signed an 
alliance with the exiled Polish Government, the Poles sought news of their 
missing officers. In one exchange in the Kremlin, Stalin told General 
Sikorski that they must have fled. 'But where could they flee to?' 'Well, to 
Manchuria for instance.' 3 

In April 1943, during the outbreak of Warsaw's Ghetto Rising, the Nazi 





authorities in Poland released a newsfilm showing the bodies of c.4,500 
murdered Polish officers unearthed in the Katyh Forest near Smolensk (they 
had found the victims taken from Kozielsk). They said it was a Soviet crime. 
The Soviets said that it was a Nazi provocation. The exiled Polish 
Government appealed to the International Red Cross for an enquiry. For this, 
they were denounced as 'Fascist collaborators' by the Kremlin, which 
promptly withdrew diplomatic recognition. One international commission 
which visited the site in 1943 under German auspices supported the German 
claims. A second commission in 1944, under Soviet auspices, supported 
Soviet claims. 4 

The Katyh Massacres presented a major embarrassment for British 
policy. Whilst playing host to the Polish Government, London was deeply 
committed to the alliance with Stalin. An official but unpublished British 
report had concluded that Soviet guilt was a 'near certainty'. But the 
superior moral purpose of the Allied cause could be put at risk. So every 
effort was made to suppress the facts. Official agencies encouraged belief in 
the Soviet version. War censorship kept contrary accounts out of 
circulation. 5 The situation was summarized in confidential SOE files: 'The 
official line in the UK has been to pretend that the whole affair was a fake ... 
Any other view would have been distasteful to the public, since it could be 
inferred that we were allied to a power guilty of the same sort of atrocities as 
the Germans.' 6 

More surprisingly, little honest information was forthcoming in 
peacetime. The Katyh murders were raised by Soviet prosecutors at the 
Nuremberg Tribunal; but the charges against Germans were soon dropped, 
and the case was not pursued. Throughout the Cold War, Polish emigres in 
London were prevented from erecting a public memorial; and British 
officers were forbidden to attend the annual services of remembrance. 
Despite the unequivocal findings of a US Congressional Committee in the 
1950s, a British Foreign Office minister was still proclaiming in 1989 that 
the rights and wrongs were unclear. In 1990-1, when Soviet responsibility 
was confirmed by President Gorbachev in part, and then by President Yeltsin 
in full, the British War Crimes Act was carefully designed to exclude Allied 
criminals from its purview. Several of the alleged NKVD murderers were 
reported alive and well in Russia. 7 

In the USSR and in communist-ruled Poland, 'Katyn' remained a non- 



subject for exactly fifty years. 8 A major Soviet memorial to Nazi barbarity 
was erected at a nearby Byelorussian village called Khatyn, to which 
millions of visitors were taken in a calculated policy of disinformation. The 
Black Book of Polish Censorship classed Katyn as an event which could not 
be mentioned, even to blame the Nazis. 9 Possession of the Lista Katyhska, a 
roll-call of the victims published abroad, was a criminal offence. 10 

Throughout that half-century, 'Katyn' offered a litmus test for the 
professional honesty of historians and their grasp of the realities of the 
Grand Alliance. It was by no means the most extreme of Soviet acts of 
violence. But it was the issue par excellence which forced commentators to 
choose between the growing weight of evidence and the self-serving 
statements of the victorious Western and Soviet governments. Those who 
chose to tell the truth stood to be dismissed as 'unscientific'. 11 


By the early summer of 1940 the Nazi war machine was ready for its assault 
on the Western alliance. It was essential to strike while German morale was high, 
and before British rearmament delivered results. The campaign was based on 
three related strategies-an operation in the Low Countries to clear the lines, the 
major land operation against France, and an air operation against Britain to 
neutralize the Royal Navy and to keep the Allies apart. Once again, German 
performance exceeded all expectations. From the merciless bombing of 
Rotterdam on 10 May to the surrender of Belgium on the 28th, the conquest of 
the Low Countries took 18 days. From the crossing of the French frontier on 14 
May to the fall of Paris on 16 June, the defeat of France took less than five 
weeks. 

The fall of France was one of those bone-chilling events which mark the end 
of an era. France had been regarded as a major military power for three 
centuries. The victory of 1918 was supposed to have redeemed the disaster of 
1870. Yet the French army, with British and Polish support, was now knocked 
out by the Nazi Wehrmacht in less time than Germany and Russia together had 
taken to knock out Poland. 1940 showed that 1870 was no aberration. The 
German invaders held no overall numerical superiority, not even in armoured 
vehicles; but their panzer divisions waged this second Blitzkrieg with great dash 
and vigour. The impregnable Maginot Line, which did not reach into Belgium, 
was simply bypassed; and the panzers drove a steel column between the British 




in the north and the main French grouping in the centre. When the outflanked 
French forces withdrew, they were pursued by an opponent moving with far 
greater speed and firepower. At Arras, a brigadier called Charles de Gaulle led 
the only significant armoured counter-attack. But the confusion was universal. 
The BEF was totally beaten, and stranded on the dunes of Dunkirk. The 51st 
(Highland) Infantry sold itself dearly on the cliffs of Sainte-Valerie-en-Caux. 
Death, capture, or evacuation were the only alternatives. 

By mid-June, when Paris was facing a repeat of the terrible siege of 70 years 
before, the French political establishment snapped. Unlike their Polish 
counterparts, who had refused to treat with invaders, the French leaders took the 
initiative in proposing a settlement. Marshal Petain, the hero of Verdun, sent an 
underling to the symbolic carriage of Compiegne to sign the capitulation. France 
was to be disarmed; 2 million French soldiers were to be interned for work in the 
Reich; an autonomous government, based at Vichy in Auvergne, would be 
allowed to rule the southern half of the country, on condition that Alsace- 
Lorraine was returned to Germany, and northern France subjected to German 
military occupation. When Hitler came to receive the salute of his legions on the 
Champs-elysees, he was master of Europe from the Pyrenees to the Pripet. A few 
assorted British, Polish, and Free French forces had scrambled back across the 
Channel; and a new defiant English voice, Churchill's, speaking in execrable 
French, crackled over the air waves: 'Une nation qui produit trois cents sortes de 
fromage ne peut pas perir.' General de Gaulle declared: 'France has lost a battle, 
but not the war.' [emu] 

Compared to the mighty conquest of France, the German air offensive 
against Britain must have seemed a secondary matter. But it proved to be one of 
the Nazis' costliest failures. Entrusted to Reichsmarschall Goring, it consisted of 
a mounting crescendo of nightly bombing raids against ports and factories, the 
so-called 'Blitz', and of accompanying air battles aimed at gaining supremacy 
over southern England and the Channel. It used a large fleet of 1,330 Heinkel 
and Junkers bombers, operating from bases in northern France and supported by 
packs of Messerschmitt and Focke-Wolf fighters. It was planned as the prelude 
to 'Operation Sealion', the invasion of Britain, whose details, including the 
arrest of some 1,100 prominent personalities, were well advanced. It was 
opposed by RAF fighter squadrons equipped with Hurricanes and Spitfires, 
roughly 10 per cent of which were manned by Polish, Czech, and Free French 
pilots. (The top ace proved to be a Czech pilot flying with the Polish 303 
Squadron.) The raid on Coventry, which missed the tank factories but levelled 



the cathedral and 500 houses, was a minor event compared to the subsequent 
exploits of the RAF over Germany. But in Allied lore it became one of the prime 
symbols of Nazi barbarism. The Battle of Britain, which was fought over four 
months, culminated on 15 September-a day when the RAF's reserves were 
almost depleted but when Goring reluctantly decided that the Luftwaffe's still 
greater losses could no longer be sustained. The air offensive, and the invasion 
of Britain, were postponed sine die. 'Never in the field of human conflict', 
Churchill told the Commons, 'has so much been owed by so many to so few.' 
After the debacle of Dunkirk, this was Britain's 'Finest Hour'. 


EMU 

In the summer of 1940 the German Reichsbank drew up plans for making 
the Reichsmark the common currency of an economic union throughout 
German-occupied Europe. Since the Nazis never succeeded in establishing a 
stable political order, the plans remained a dead letter. 

A second attempt at monetary union was made thirty years later, under 
the auspices of the European Commission. Post-war arrangements based on 
the gold-backed US dollar were ailing; and the currencies of the Common 
Market, especially the Deutschmark, were uncomfortably strong. First the 
Barre report of 1969, then a committee headed by Pierre Werner of 
Luxembourg, drew up plans for full EMU (European Monetary Union) by 
1980. In the meantime, a mechanism nicknamed 'the Snake' was to hold the 
exchange rates of member currencies in line both with each other and with 
the dollar. The system was quickly disarmed by the USA's abandonment of 
the dollar's gold standard in 1971 and by the Common Market's acceptance 
of Great Britain, which soon left the Snake. Only five of a possible nine 
currencies held to a much-modified Snake in the 1970s. 1 

The third attempt was launched in 1977 by a speech from the British 
President of the European Commission, Roy Jenkins. His initiative bore fruit 
two years later, with the introduction of the EMS (European Monetary 
System) together with a new exchange rate mechanism (ERM) and its own 
supporting currency, the ecu (see p. 1086). The system was greatly 
strengthened in the 1980s by France's policy of the franc fort linked to the 




DM, and by the Single European Act (1986), which attracted the pound 
sterling into the ERM. All seemed to be going well until the reunification of 
Germany in 1990, and the fateful decision to exchange the worthless East 
German Ostmark at parity with the Deutschmark. After that, high German 
interest rates put weaker currencies at a disadvantage, forcing them either to 
devalue beneath the permitted limits or to float outside the system 
completely. By August 1993 only the DM and the Dutch guilder remained 
within the narrow band of the ERM, described by earlier proponents of the 
Maastricht Treaty as the 'glide-path to EMU' (see pp. 1126-7). 

In 1940-5, despite Germany's military victories, a subordinate Reichsbank 
was never strong enough to put its monetary plans into operation. After 
1969, an independent Bundesbank was always strong enough to put its own 
immediate priorities first. One can only conclude that economic plans 
conceived in the absence of an effective political framework are always 
doomed to failure. 


Britain's victory in the air was crucial on three scores. It gave the Allied 
cause an impregnable base, where the vastly superior land forces of the 
Continent could never be brought to bear. Secondly, by turning Britain into 'the 
world's most unsinkable aircraft carrier', it secured a platform for the sensational 
growth of Allied air power-the decisive element of the war in the West. 
Thirdly, on the diplomatic front, it gained a breathing-space within which the 
latent alliance of the English-speaking world could mature. Churchill, who 
became Prime Minister on 7 May at the height of the French crisis, had strong 
American connections and a strong determination to involve the Americans as 
soon as possible. But in autumn 1940 Britain represented the last foothold of the 
Allied cause in Europe. Without the preservation of Great Britain by the RAF, 
the USA could never have intervened in the European War. As it was, American 
assistance kept Great Britain financially and psychologically afloat during 'the 
darkest days'. In September 1940, old US destroyers were traded for the 
American rights to build military bases on British islands in the Caribbean. This 
was extended in March 1941 in the wider principles of the Lend-Lease Bill. 
Germany had good reason to complain. 

The war at sea was not resolved so quickly. Germany mounted a determined 




challenge to Britain's naval supremacy, with a line of ultra-modern 'pocket 
battleships' and a growing fleet of U-boats. The first round saw the British 
veteran, Royal Oak, sunk at her berth in Scapa flow, and the German GrafSpee 
harried to her doom in the River Plate. Then the Bismarck and the Tirpitz took to 
sea. The former, having destroyed her pursuer, HMS Hood, with one spectacular 
shot, was disabled by an aerial torpedo, then sunk by the pack. The latter was 
chased into a Norwegian fiord. As in the First World War, however, Germany's 
chief effort was put into the submarine campaign. After the French ports of Brest 
and Nantes fell into Nazi hands, the 'Battle of the Atlantic' raged for three years 
(see below). 

In the Mediterranean, Allied interests clashed with those of the Axis powers 
over control of North Africa and the Suez Canal. Matters were brought to a head 
in May 1940, when Mussolini declared war and invaded the French Alps. The 
Italian base in Tripoli was surrounded by the British in Palestine and Egypt and 
by the French in Tunis and Algiers; and it soon required the dispatch of a 
German Afrika Korps for its sustenance. The 2,000-mile shipping lane between 
Gibraltar and Alexandria was only protected by Britain's half-way station at 
Malta, which heroically survived unending blockade and bombardment. Yet the 
most tragic action of the early years took place between the Western Powers. 
When Paris fell to the Nazis, Britain demanded the surrender of the entire French 
fleet, a large part of which was berthed in the Algerian base of Mers-el-Kabir. 
When the French admiral declined, on 3 July 1940 the Royal Navy executed a 
merciless order to destroy all the French ships and their crews at anchor. 
Attention then turned to the Libyan desert. Faced with the advance of the Afrika 
Korps on one side and with growing Jewish terrorism in Palestine on the other, 
Britain's hold on Egypt remained precarious until the victory at the second battle 
of El Alamein on 23 October 1942. Anglo-American forces landed in Morocco 
and Algeria in the following month. 

In the mean time, with Hitler preoccupied in the West, Stalin renewed his 
aggressions in the East. After the Finnish fiasco, he reverted to what the New 
York 'Times had aptly described as 'playing the hyena to Hitler's lion'. This time 
his targets lay in the three Baltic States, and in parts of Romania, which he 
conveniently seized whilst the world was diverted by the fate of France. 

In the Baltics, the Soviet Union had mounted a concerted campaign of 
subversion. Then, in June 1940, communist cells in Estonia, Latvia, and 
Lithuania were activated to call for Soviet 'assistance'. Moscow demanded the 



admission of the Red Army on the pretext of Soviet security interests. In the 
ensuing uproar, the governments collapsed; the Red Army marched in; pre¬ 
packaged plebiscites were staged with foregone results; and the Stalinist Terror 
set to work with unrivalled ferocity. Amongst the massacres and the 
deportations, an arrangement was reached to transfer the entire German 
population of the Baltic States to areas of German-occupied Poland. It is hard for 
Westerners to grasp, but from the viewpoint of Tallinn, Riga, or Vilnius, the 
growing possibility of a Nazi advance felt like blessed liberation from 
Liberation. In the case of Romania, Stalin counted more on direct German help. 
Romania's fragile freedom depended largely on the continued export of oil to 
Germany. So when Moscow made demands and Berlin advised compliance, 
there was no easy way for Bucharest to refuse. On 27 June 1940, ten days after 
the Baltic States, the Romanian provinces of Bukovina and Bessarabia were 
grabbed amidst fanfares of their 'reunion with the Soviet fatherland'. Romania, 
humiliated, was left smarting for revenge, [moldova] [tschernowitz] 

By the autumn of 1940 the benefits of the Nazi-Soviet partnership could be 
weighed; and it was obvious that Hitler was gaining more than Stalin. The 
industrial and strategic value of France, the Low Countries, and Scandinavia was 
much greater than that of the Soviet conquests. Though the Fiihrer was held off 
by the wily Franco, whom he had met at Hendaye, the Fascist bloc commanded 
the greater part of the Continent. What is more, Germany had made its colossal 
gains at minimal cost: a protracted contest with the West had been avoided. 
From Stalin's point of view, Hitler's success was beginning to look menacing. 
After France, there were only two destinations left for German expansion: one 
was the traditional Russian hunting-ground in the Balkans; the other was the 
Soviet Union itself. 

The tensions surfaced when Molotov visited Berlin in November 1940. He 
behaved with excruciating crudity, emitting a torrent of tactless demands. One 
assumes that he had been ordered to test the limits of German tolerance. When 
the Fiihrer admitted that Germany was engaged in 'a life and death struggle' with 
Britain, Molotov said, 'Yes, Germany is fighting for its life and Britain for 
Germany's death.' Both sides suspected that the partnership was doomed. It is 
not known exactly what instructions Stalin gave to the Red Army; but on 18 
December Hitler issued Instruction 21 for the preparation of Operation 
Barbarossa. 

The Balkan crisis of April 1941 had its roots in Mussolini's blunders. The 



Italian troops who had advanced from Albania into northern Greece were being 
mauled by the doughty Greeks; and the Duce was in need of another German 
rescue. Apart from that, the royal Yugoslav Government was being hounded 
from within and without. After the Regency had tried to sign an agreement with 
Germany, it' was deposed by the military. When the Wehrmacht moved in, the 
country fell apart. After 11 days of fighting, the Germans were left in occupation 
of a huge and hostile territory. The Yugoslav Government fled into exile in 
London. Croatia declared itself an independent republic. Hungarians, Bulgarians, 
and Italians all took chunks of the carcass. Underground armies proliferated. The 
terrible UstaSi or Croat 'insurrectionaries' were set on ethnic cleansing of their 
Serbian minority, deploying the full fascist repertoire of death camps and mass 
executions. The royalist Cetniks, who led the Yugoslav resistance, were 
increasingly opposed by a rival communist movement led by Josip Broz, 'Tito' 
(1892-1980). The fierce determination of the Yugoslav partisans to kill the 
invaders was only exceeded by their proclivity for killing each other, [noyades] 

Further south, in Greece, the Germans carried all before them. Athens was 
occupied; a British force which had tried to hold Crete was overwhelmed by the 
end of May. 

Stalin's reaction to the Balkan crisis showed no signs of solidarity with 
Hitler. One day before the German attack, on 5 April, he had signed a treaty of 
friendship with Yugoslavia. On 13 April he signed a vital neutrality pact with 
Japan. The USSR was clearing the decks for major action in Europe. On 15 May, 
Zhukov is known to have suggested that the Red Army forestall the Wehrmacht 
by attacking first and disrupting German preparations.. 


MOLDOVA 

Five young harvesters are sitting on a rug, eating their lunch on a rise 
amidst the golden cornfields. A girl in a bright red headscarf has spread out 
the newspaper on her knees, and is reading to her smiling companions. They 
are sharing a flagon of wine or water, a bowl of bread or rice, and a huge red 
water-melon. Acres of standing wheat and sheaves roll down to the green 
valley and to the wooded hills beyond. In the foreground a gleaming green 
motorcycle is parked; in the distance a combine is reaping. The location, as 




indicated by the pattern of the mg, is Moldavia (now Moldova). The date 
could be any time after 1940, when Moldavia was annexed to the USSR. 
The painting, by Alexei Vasilev, is called They are talking about us in 
Pravda'. 1 (See Plate 70.) 

This is hardly great art. But the technique is competent; and the effect is 
pleasant to the eye. Without indulging any crude political gesture, Vasilev 
has succeeded in mobilizing all the main elements of Socialist Realism-or 
'revolutionary romanticism' as Zhdanov called it-as decreed by the Party 
authorities in 1934. He produces a picture which, to quote Stalin's phrase, is 
'national in form, and socialist in content'. The narod-nost' or national spirit 
of the work is implicit in the link between these Moldavian peasants and 
their admirers in Moscow. Its partiinost' or 'devotion to the party' is explicit 
in their delight at the mention of their work in the Party paper. Its klassovost' 
or 'class-consciousness' is underlined by their peasant clothes and physical 
labour. Its ideinost' or 'ideological character' is manifest in their optimistic 
and politically correct attitudes. Its tipichnost' or 'representative message' 
comes over loud and clear: happy workers plus modern machinery make for 
high productivity and the welfare of the masses. It is overtly socialist, and it 
looks quite realistic. 

The fact is, all the most important realities of life in the Soviet Union 
have been systematically falsified. In reality, the Moldavian peasantry had 
recently been robbed both of its land and its culture. They were forced to 
live and work in collectives, whose surplus was taken away by the Soviet 
state. Thousands upon thousands had been driven to their death in the Gulag, 
or shot as so-called saboteurs. Their language had been arbitrarily 
transferred to the Cyrillic alphabet, so that Soviet-educated children could no 
longer read pre-war Romanian or Moldavian literature. They were denied ah 
contact with the western half of their province in Romania, which they were 
told was a foreign country. They were beaten, beggared, and bullied. And the 
world was told they were stunningly content. 

For the impartial viewer, the question posed is this: how much aesthetic 
value can art retain when, in human and moral terms, its principal purpose is 
fraudulent? 



TSCHERNOWITZ 


The Soviet army's entry into northern Bukovina in June 1940 was the first 
step in the destruction of a civilization. Conquered by Austria from the 
Ottomans in 1775, this corner of old Moldavia had passed a century and a 
half as the furthest outpost of the Habsburg realms. It was then taken over 
for twenty years by Romania. Its capital city, Tschernowitz/Cernati. on the 
Prut, was the centre of a polyglot, multi-denominational, hierarchical society 
where the imperial German culture of Mitteleuropa had lain like a 
transparent sheet over the rich layers of local Jewish, Romanian, Polish, and 
Ruthenian life. After fifty years of Soviet levelling it has been left, as 
Chernovtsy, a drab provincial backwater of Ukraine. 

Old Bukovina has vanished. But it can still be glimpsed through the 
nostalgia of an exile who returned in the last months of Soviet rule, having 
been raised in the 1920s amidst 'futile attempts to maintain the dignity of a 
German ruling class in the border marches of a defunct empire': 

The old houses are still painted in an Austrian egg-yolk yellow, alternated 
with an imperial Russian pea green. But the Bukovinian melting-pot has 
gone ... all have been killed or repatriated, and their places taken by stolid, 
cabbage-eating Ukrainians. The wild, colorful, murderous variegation ... has 
been replaced by the sub-Stalinist uniformity of Chernovtsy. The market in 
the city square, where 'under a fragrant cloud of garlic' Jews, Armenians, 
Lipovanians, and Germans haggled for sheepskins, sharp cheese, rotgut, and 
tobacco, cooking oil and cowdung, is now a concrete-covered parade 
ground, hung with a gigantic billboard of Lenin. The cosmopolitan border 
world of Austria-Hungary and tsarist Russia has been transformed into 'an 
immense 


From Yugoslavia, the German battle divisions were transported to the 
Reich's eastern borders. In early June 1941, the backwoods and byways from 
East Prussia to Romania were filled with the bustle of German bivouacs and the 
revving of tank engines. Every Polish peasant, and most of the world's 
intelligence services, knew that Hitler was preparing to attack the Soviet Union. 
The only person who didn't appear to know was Stalin, who ordered that border 




provocations should be avoided at all costs. 

In the absence of the necessary documentation, the circumstances have never 
been clarified. Conventional wisdom has usually held either that Stalin could not 
comprehend the depths of Hitler's treachery or that he was playing for time to 
complete his defences. Neither seems likely. One did not have to be an expert to 
realize that the German war machine had nowhere to go but eastwards. Hitler's 
earlier thinking had foreseen all-out war in 1942 or 1943; but he had now to 
decide either to follow the momentum of success or to call a halt and risk losing 
the initiative. For the ex-corporal and his gang of adventurers there was hardly a 
moment's hesitation; their urge was to ride on to glory or to Gotterdammerung . 

As for Stalin, the master of secrecy, one can only speculate. However, as the 
Germans would soon discover, the Soviets had not been idle. Huge military 
concentrations had been repositioned in vulnerable forward areas; the warplanes 
of the Soviet air force stood exposed on forward airfields; frontier cordons had 
been withdrawn; roads and bridges had been repaired to facilitate the movement 
of heavy traffic. The Red Army's stance was one of imminent attack. Everything 
points to the probability that Stalin had been acting dumb in order to conceal his 
preparations for a surprise offensive against the Reich.- If so, he was beaten to 
the draw. The Wehrmacht struck at dawn on 22 June. 

The Nazi Supremacy in Europe (June 1941-July 1943). Operation Barbarossa, 
which took the German army deep into the Soviet Union, launched the central 
military and political play of the Second World War in Europe. It opened up the 
front which was to account for 75 per cent of German war casualties, and which 
must be judged the main scene of Hitler's ultimate defeat. It came astonishingly 
close to total success, and for two or three years vastly extended the territory of 
the Nazis' New Order. The offensive of 1941 carried the Wehrmacht to the gates 
of Moscow; the offensive of 1942 led them to the Volga and the Caucasus (see 
Map 26). 

The initial attack of June 1941 had spectacular results. One hundred and 
fifty-six divisions, consisting of over 3 million men, crossed the Ribbentrop- 
Molotov line and caught the Red Army entirely out of position. The Soviet air 
force was destroyed on the ground in a couple of days. Whole Soviet armies 
were surrounded, and vast numbers of prisoners taken. Panzer columns raced 
forward at unprecedented speed. In the Baltic States, in Byelorussia, and Ukraine 
they were cheered as liberators. German soldiers were greeted by local peasants 


offering the traditional welcome of bread and salt. In Lwow, where the retreating 
NKVD had massacred many thousands of its political prisoners, a public 
demonstration openly declared for Ukrainian independence. By December, 
despite the lack of winter equipment, forward German units had entered Russia 
and laid siege to Leningrad. They caught the Moscow Kremlin in their 
binoculars, before (on the same day as Pearl Harbor) Stalin's secret reserve of 
fresh Siberian divisions arrived to drive them back. [Smolensk] 

In 1942 the German Command chose to direct its advance along the southern 
steppes. Their priority was to seize the good black earth of Ukraine, and the 
distant oil of Baku. Yet they were meeting ever more effective resistance; and 
the retreating Soviets had stripped the land bare. The industrial areas were 
empty; the factories had been dismantled and removed to points east, and the 
working population evacuated; the great dam of Dniepropetrovsk, pride of the 
Five-Year Plans, had been dynamited. German soldiers scaled Mount Elbruz. 
When the second winter set in, they were approaching the Volga at Stalingrad. 



SMOLENSK 


In July 1941 the Wehrmacht captured Smolensk with such speed that the I 
local Communist Party house and all its contents fell into German hands. 
The Smolensk archives contained detailed files on all aspects of communist 
activity since the Revolution, including Stalin's purges and the Great Terror. 
Carried off to Germany, they were duly captured for a second time in 1945 
by the American army, and taken to the USA. They were far smaller than the 
vast collections of Nazi documents which fell into American hands and 
which would form the core of the American-run Document Centre in Berlin. 
But the Soviet authorities had never granted free access to their state 
archives, let alone to secret Party records. So the windfall from Smolensk 
had inestimable value. Historical studies based on its files penetrated the fog 
of Soviet propaganda and Western theorizing, and provided one of the first 
authentic glimpses into the true nature of communist rule. 1 

Many Sovietologists and Soviet apologists, however, were not happy. 
Having framed their fantasies in the knowledge that little or no primary 
evidence was available, they had no wish to confront hard facts. Hence, 
when the scholar who first analysed the Smolensk archives concluded that 
Stalin had perpetrated 'an almost continuous purge' in the 1930s, he was 
promptly denounced. 'This view', the arch-apologist could glibly declare, 'is 
weakly supported by the available primary evidence.' 2 Such sophistry often 
passed for science until the fall of the Soviet Union. 

Archives have always attracted those who wish to manipulate the writing 
of history. In 1992 the Russian authorities revealed the existence of the so- 
called Osobii Arkhif or 'Special Archive', which the Soviet regime had kept 
separate from all other records. Its full contents were still to be determined; 
but in addition to the Goebbels diaries, they certainly included such items as 
the records from France's Surete Nationale and from Poland's pre-war 
Dwojka or 'Military intelligence', even the papers of the British 
Expeditionary Force (1940) and of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. It was 
said to contain all the missing collections of the Nazis' RSHA (Reich 
Security Main Office). Apparently, Nazi archive-hunters had put their swag 



from all over Europe into various castles and cellars in Poland and eastern 
Germany, only to see it looted in turn by the Red Army. The Soviets repaid 
the loss of the Smolensk archive many times over, [metryka] 

Still more intriguing is the possibility that parts of the captured Nazi 
archives were falsified after they fell into communist hands. In Warsaw, for 
example, the post-war communist Security Office (UB) inherited the 
contents of the city's former Gestapo secretariat. Armed with the appropriate 
registers, codes, stationery, blank report forms, and official seals, it was a 
simple matter to amend the records. The UB had little difficulty providing 
documents to show that Poland's resistance movement, the Home Army, had 
been run by Nazi collaborators. 3 

For fifty years, therefore, historians' views of the mid-twentieth century 
have been given a one-sided slant by the one-sided nature of the 
documentation. 4 But in the 1990s the hidden treasures of the ex-communist 
world were starting to restore the balance. In Germany, as the files of the 
East German Stasi were yielding their secrets, the Nazi files of the Berlin 
Document Centre were being prepared for transfer to the Federal 
Government. In Washington, congressional hearings were held to challenge 
the move. 5 For, as the victors of the Second World War were only too well 
aware, Tower brings knowledge, and knowledge power'. 


The German advance to the Volga extended the territory under Hitler's 
control by an area equal to all the Nazi conquests in Western Europe. It gave him 
the Lebensraum of which he had dreamed. The lawless zone beyond the Reich 
now stretched out for more than l,ooo miles. The Nazis, it transpired, had no 
intention of consulting the wishes of the inhabitants. There were to be no 
independent republics-only military government in the front-line regions, and 
Reichs-kommissariats run by the SS in the 'Ostland' and Ukraine. The national 
movement in Ukraine, which in 1917-18 had been given full German support, 
was to be crushed. Through wilful stupidity, the Nazis spurned all the chances to 
win the population to their side. Through sheer arrogance, they turned their 
largest asset into an unbearable burden. Their savagery knew no bounds. They 
gave their new subjects no option but to resist. One hundred peasants were to be 
executed for every German soldier killed by 'bandits'. Villages were routinely 
razed, and their inhabitants murdered. Nazi officials felt free to massacre people 




at will. As in Poland, the population was screened, assigned to racial categories, 
and issued with ration cards and work permits according to their classification. 
Where Jews were not killed outright, they were cast into ghettoes. The Slavonic 
nations, whose elites were slated for annihilation, were regarded as fit only for a 
pool of uneducated slave workers. Several million men and women were sent to 
the Reich for forced labour. With the growth of all categories of 'undesirables', 
the Nazi network of prisoner-of-war and concentration camps was greatly 
expanded. Since Soviet prisoners of war were granted no rights, some 3-4 
million men were allowed to perish in open enclosures. The East was treated as a 
fund for unlimited human and material exploitation. In three years, the 
population of Ukraine dropped by 9 million. 

Yet the Nazis' self-styled 'Crusade for Civilization' was able to attract 
considerable support. Large contingents were sent to the Eastern Front by 
Romania, Hungary, and Italy. Romania took charge of Odessa and the district of 
'Transnistria'. General Franco's crack 'Blue Division' was sent from Spain. In 
the Baltic States, existing army and police units were transferred to German 
service. Recruits and volunteers flocked in from almost all the occupied 
countries. Some of these, especially among Soviet prisoners of war, were 
volunteers in name only, having been given a choice between service or 
starvation. But many others, especially from Western Europe, joined willingly. 
General Vlasov, a former Soviet officer, commanded the million-strong Russian 
Liberation Army. A Cossack Brigade attracted many pre-war exiles. Even the 
Waffen-SS recruited large numbers of foreigners, [lettland] 

Holocaust. In conjunction with their occupation of the Eastern Lebensraum, the 
Nazis launched their largest and most systematic campaign of racial genocide. 
What they characteristically labelled 'the Final Solution of the Jewish Question' 
has since been called the 'Holocaust' or, in Hebrew, the Shoah. It was an attempt 
to exploit modern industrial technology to kill every Jewish man, woman, and 
child in Europe, simply for being Jews. Its starting-point is obscure. No direct 
order from the Fiihrer has been unearthed, although his ultimate responsibility is 
incontestable. There is every reason to suppose that Hitler took precautions to 
conceal his involvement and to avoid the bad publicity which had arisen from 
leaks about the earlier Euthanasia Campaign. - Europe's Jews were to be the 
prime, though not the sole target for the Nazi programme of racial murders. 

After several years of prudent restraint, Hitler had returned in 1938-9 to the 


extreme language of his early career. In a broadcast on 30 January 1939 he made 
a 'prophesy' that if the Jews precipitated another war, then the effect would be 
the Vernichtung, destruction, of all Jews. Yet prior to July 1941, despite high 
mortality in the Nazi-built ghettos of occupied Poland, there had been no move 
towards wholesale slaughter. Indeed, vague talk had continued about the 
dispatch of Jews to distant destinations and about the sensitivities of the neutral 
USA. Yet on 31 July 1941 Goring ordered the chief of the RSHA (Reich 
Security Main Office) to prepare 'the Final Solution'.- Some time shortly 
beforehand, he must have received express instructions from the Fiihrer. All 
hesitations were to be cast aside. The policy was annihilation. 'Resettlement' 
became an official euphemism for genocide. As the German armies advanced 
into the heart of the former tsarist Pale, the notorious Einsatzgruppen 
reappeared, rounding up Jews by the thousand, driving them to pits and gulleys 
and shooting them en masse. One such action, at the chasm of Babi Yar near 
Kiev, would involve the shooting of 70,000 victims. 

In January 1942 SS chiefs, including Adolf Eichmann, the head of the 
RSHA's IV-B-4 Jewish Section, held a one-day conference at a villa on the 
Wannsee near Berlin to co-ordinate technical and organizational arrangements. 
Decisions were taken to accelerate experiments with Zyklon-B gas; to create a 
number of dedicated death camps, at Chelmno, Belzec, Sobibor, and Treblinka; 
to expand the Nazi concentration camps in occupied Poland, notably KL 
Auschwitz II-Birkenau; to consult the best German firms regarding crematorium 
design and 'surplus disposal'; to draw up the timetables and rolling-stock for 
international railway transports; and to recruit auxiliary formations. If one did 
not know the object of the exercise, one could be forgiven for mistaking it for 
the AGM of German abattoirists: 7-8 million 'units' were designated for 
processing. The problem was to collect them, transport them, and dispose of 
them as quietly and as efficiently as possible, [noyades] From then on, the Final 
Solution proceeded without interruption for three years-town by town, ghetto 
by ghetto, district by district, country by country. In 1942-3 it concentrated on 
the largest single category-the 3 million Jews of occupied Poland. In 1943-5 it 
spread to the Balkans, to the Low Countries, to France, and to Hungary. In the 
end it achieved perhaps 65 per cent of its target. It was only brought to a halt 
when the facilities were overrun by the Allied armies. 


LETTLAND 


Latvians had no special love for Germany. Germans had formed a ruling , 
caste in the Baltic States since medieval times, and had been loyal servants 
of tsarist Russia. Yet such was the effect of the massacres and deportations 
of Soviet rule in 1940-1 that the arrival of the Wehrmacht promised blessed 
relief. 

The Germans encountered little opposition, therefore, when they started 
to raise Latvian military formations as soon as they entered Riga on 1 July 
1941. At first, ex-Latvian army and police units and ex-Soviet Army 
deserters were reorganized under German command. 'Auxiliary Security 
Police', later renamed Schutzmannschaft or 'Schuma', were used for front¬ 
line service, for guard, labour, and fire-fighting duties, and for 'special 
operations'. (The last euphemism turned out to include the murder of Jews 
under SS-guidance.) In 1942 a conscription decree greatly increased the 
numbers, whilst facilitating the formation both of low-grade Hilfswillige or 
'Hiwi' units and of a regular 'Latvian Legion'. From 1943, swelled by 
volunteers, the Legion was to feed the main recruitment drive for three 
Latvian divisions of the Waffen-SS (see Appendix III, pp. 1326-7). The men 
swore an oath 'to struggle against Bolshevism' and 'to obey the commander- 
in-chief of the German armed forces, Adolf Hitler'. Their language of 
command was Latvian, and they wore arm-shields bearing the name Latvija, 
They fought at Leningrad, and in the German retreat all the way to Berlin. 1 

At a meeting with the Reichsfuhrer-SS in 1944, the chief of staff of the 
Latvian Legion recorded Himmler's updated vision of the Nazi Order: 

The present demands that every SS-offlcer, regardless of nationality ... must 
look to the whole living space of the family of German nations. [He then 
singled out those nations which he regarded as belonging to the German 
family: the Germans, the Dutch, the Flemish, the Anglo-Saxons, the 
Scandinavians, and the Baltic peoples.] To combine all those nations into 
one big family is the most important task at present. It is natural in this 
process that the German nation, as the largest and strongest, must assume the 
leading role. [But] this unification has to take place on the principle of 
equality... [Later] this family ... has to take on the mission to include all 



Roman nations, and then the Slavic nations, because they, too, are of the 
white race. It is only through unification of the white race that Western 
culture could be saved from the danger of the yellow race. 

At the present time, the Waffen-SS is leading in this respect because its 
organisation is based on equality. The Waffen-SS comprises not only 
German, Roman and Slavic but even Islamic units ... fighting in close 
togetherness. Therefore it is of great importance that every Waffen-SS 
officer gets his training at the same military college... ? 

Nazi internationalism only came to the fore in the final phase of the war 
when Germany was standing on the brink of defeat. It does not feature 
prominently in accounts of Fascist ideology. Nor do the reasons why so 
many Europeans fought for it. One forgets that the Nazis published a journal 
called Nation Europa. 


In due course the horrific dimensions of humanity in extremis have become 
well known through a mass of memoirs and documentary material. A bright 
young Jewish girl recorded her daily thoughts as she lay in hiding at 263 
Prinsengracht in Amsterdam.- The head of the Judenrat or Jewish Council in 
Warsaw recorded the agonizing dilemmas which he faced trying to serve both 
his own people and the Nazis.- The death-cell autobiography of a former death- 
camp commandant revealed a conscientious and sentimental man completely 
impervious to moral reflection: 

In Auschwitz, I truly had no reason to complain that I was bored... I had only one end in view, to drive 
everyone and everything forward so that I could accomplish the measures laid down. 

I had to watch coldly as mothers with laughing or crying children went to the gas-chambers ... I had to 
stand for hours on end in the ghastly stench... I had to look through the peep-holes ... and watch the 
process of death itself. 

My family, for sure, were well provided for at Auschwitz. When I saw my children playing happily, or 
observed my wife's delight in our youngest, the thought would often come over me, how long will our 
happiness last?- 

Some have used the imaginative insights of fictional literature to approach 
these lower realms.- But the most moving testimony comes from those who 
simply sought to preserve their humanity, [responsa] 

Discussions about contemporary attitudes have centred on the alleged 





passivity of Jews and the alleged complacency of Gentiles. Both accusations are 
overstated. Mindful of the inspiring example of Janusz Korczak, a well-known 
Polish writer who calmly accompanied a group of orphans on their last journey 
from the Ghetto, a surviving combatant has said: To go quiedy was also 
heroic.'- Another recalls the inaction of his own Jewish family when 
neighbours were removed for the gas-chambers.- Jews participated in the 
underground partisan movement, sometimes in separate units; and armed risings 
took place in several ghettos. In Warsaw, the heroic Ghetto Rising erupted on 19 
April 1943 to oppose the final clearance. It lasted for three weeks, until all but 
eighty of the fighters were killed. Its leader, Mordecai Anielewicz, committed 
suicide with the last group of friends in the final redoubt on Mila Street.- At 
Treblinka, a determined break-out led to the successful escape of 300 inmates, 
[katyn] 


RESPONSA 

On 3 October 1943 a boy was saved from a Kinderaktion, which killed 
large numbers of Jewish children in the Nazi-built ghetto of Kaunas 
(Kowno) in Lithuania. The man who had saved the boy asked his rabbi 
whether the boy might be brought up as his own son. The rabbi offered 
words of comfort, but the answer was 'No'. The boy must always be taught 
to honour his own father and mother. 1 

In the vast literature of the Jewish Holocaust, few items can compare in 
their moral grandeur to the rabbinical responsa from the ghettos of Nazi- 
occupied Europe. Answering queries about the religious dilemmas of their 
flock was one of the rabbis' central duties; and it was their custom to keep a 
register of the questions asked and the replies given. Several such registers 
exist, but none more moving than that of Rabbi Ephraim Oshry of Kaunas, a 
survivor, who pieced it together after the war. Even the briefest selection of 
contents reveals a community on the brink of extinction that was still intent 
on leading a principled existence: 

• Can Jews try to save themselves by obtaining a forged certificate of 
(Christian) baptism? It is absolutely forbidden. 

• Is it permissible for a pregnant woman to seek an abortion in the ghetto? 





Yes, because without the abortion both mother and child will be killed. 

• Is a woman in the ghetto, whose husband has disappeared, entitled to be 
released from the usual rules governing remarriage? No. 

• May a Jew in the ghetto commit suicide? It is better to receive burial after 
suicide than to be cremated after extermination. 

• Can an apostate Jew wearing a cross be buried in holy ground? Yes, but at 
a little distance from the other burials. 

• Can a child born from extramarital fornication receive \hepidyan haben 
ritual of the first-born? Yes. 

• What should be done with the garments of murdered Jews? According to 
religious law, blood-stained garments must be buried; but unstained 
garments may be given to the children of the victims. 2 

It has been said that responsa issued under the duress of the Holocaust 
exhibit undue lenience. That is a matter for expert judgement. But anyone 
can recognize a desire to combine the rigour of the Jewish law with the duty 
of compassion. In August 1941, for example, German soldiers had filled the 
synagogue at Slobodka with dead cats and dogs, before ordering a group of 
Jews to tear up the Torah scrolls on top of the carcasses and to set fire to the 
building. When Rabbi Oshry was asked how atonement might be obtained, 
the persons concerned were starving. His response was clear but gentle: 
'they should fast in atonement, if they can.' 3 

Much comment has been expended on the charge of the alleged 
'passivity' of Europe's condemned Jews. In some circles Jews driven to 
collaborate have even been branded as 'war criminals'. 4 The Hasidic view 
certainly was that 'God's face is covered' during times of persecution, and 
that devout Jews should accept their fate. 5 Non-Hasidic rabbis did not follow 
such a firm rule, although there was a long tradition of respecting the law of 
the land. The Chief Rabbi of Athens destroyed the membership lists of his 
congregation, enabling many to survive. The Chief Rabbi of Salonika did 
not do so, and most of his flock were killed. 

The real point is that decisions, whether to co-operate or to resist, were 
taken on the basis of positive moral principle. Even where no action was 
taken, the evidence does not lie on the side of moral passivity or 
indifference. It is impossible to deny that individuals could commit all 



manner of treachery. But the counter-examples are legion. A team of Jewish 
doctors in the Warsaw ghetto determined to turn their misery to good use and 
to conduct a scientific study of the symptoms and progress of their own 
starvation. Hidden in a buried milk chum, their study survived to be 
published in post-war Warsaw. 6 

In the Nazi death-camp at Sachsenhausen, a Jewish member of a 
Sonderkommando, which was carrying out the physical work of 
extermination, recognized the rabbi of his own congregation on the ramp. 
The rabbi's one request was that the luz, the top vertebra of his backbone, be 
salvaged. (In Jewish belief, the luz is the core round which the body will 
reform in the afterlife.) So the man cut the bone from the rabbi's corpse, and 
was last seen vowing to bury it in holy ground in Jerusalem after the war. 7 


Gentile attitudes were not uniform. Most people, living themselves in the 
shadow of terror, did nothing; a few assisted in the genocide. Yet many showed 
compassion. A poet felt anguish at the sight of a children's playground beside the 
Ghetto Wall in Warsaw which reminded him of the lonely death of Giordano 
Bruno: 

I thought of the Campo di Fiori 
in Warsaw by the sky carousel 
one clear Spring evening 
to the strains of a carnival tune. 

The bright melody drowned 
the salvos from the ghetto wall, 
and couples were flying 
high in the cloudless sky. 

Those dying here, the lonely 
forgotten by the world, 
our tongue becomes for them 
the language of an ancient planet. 

Until, when all is legend 
and many years have passed, 
on a new Campo di Fiori 




rage will kindle at a poet's word.- 

A thoughtful Catholic intellectual has written of the moral involvement even of 
those who took no practical part.- 

Europe's response to the Holocaust touched the depths of depravation and 
the heights of heroism. In the eye of the storm, in occupied Poland, the chances 
of saving the segregated Jews were never very great. Critics from more fortunate 
countries do not always realize how a totalitarian regime drives everyone in its 
power to varying degrees of complicity. Unfree people should not be judged by 
the criteria of free societies. Even so, there were individuals, the so-called szmal- 
cownicy or 'greasers', who did sell fugitive Jews (and members of the 
Resistance) to the Gestapo. There were others who risked their lives, and those 
of their families, to hide and protect the fugitives. In 1943 the Polish Resistance 
set up the Zegota organization to help save Jews.- Perhaps 150,000, or 5 per 
cent, survived by hiding in barns and cellars, in convents, on false papers, or in 
the woods.- [batt-ioi] 

Elsewhere, in less extreme circumstances, Europeans showed everything 
from noble sacrifice to apathy. In Copenhagen, where King Christian rode out 
into the streets in sympathy wearing a Star of David armband, most of 
Denmark's 300 Jews were able to escape. In Romania, where the army and 
police killed hundreds of thousands of Jews on their own account, the 
government none the less jibbed at handing over Romanian Jews to the Nazis. In 
France, where the Vichy regime operated its own execrable concentration camps, 
as at Le Vernet, the local milice took the lead in collecting Jews. They made a 
distinction between 'alien' Jewish refugees and 'native' French Jews, only 8 per 
cent of whom lost their lives. The French Protestant Churches registered their 
protest, and the French Resistance took steps to disrupt the deportation trains. In 
Holland, despite a determined Resistance movement, most Jews were lost. In 
Hungary, which stayed free of Nazi occupation until 1944, a resourceful Swedish 
diplomat, Ralph Wallenberg, organized many Jewish escapes. He was due to 
disappear, for his pains, under Soviet detention. Local Zionist leaders were 
charged with striking deals at others' expense. Even in the German-occupied 
Channel Islands, Jews were handed over. Jews were generally safest in Fascist 
Italy, in Italian-occupied Yugoslavia, in Fascist Spain or Portugal.- [taize] 

The lack of demonstrative protest from the Vatican was the subject of much 
subsequent controversy. Pius XII's detractors believe that he was indifferent to 


the Jewish tragedy. His defenders claim that he was torn by fears of reprisals 
against German Catholics, and by a desire to maintain 'impartiality' between the 
evils of Fascism and Communism.- He certainly did little for the millions of 
Catholics killed by the Nazis. 

The exact Jewish death-toll will never be known. An estimate' of 5.85 
million was made for the Nuremberg Tribunal. It is unlikely to be very 
inaccurate. In round terms, the total was made up of c.3 million Jews from pre¬ 
war Poland, c.i million from the USSR, and c.i million from other countries. 
There may be some overlap between the Polish and the Soviet categories, since 
in 1939 the eastern part of Poland was annexed to the USSR. But no responsible 
estimates have brought the total below 5 million.- In quantitative terms, this 
figure may be compared with estimates of c.8.7 million Soviet and c.3.5 million 
German military losses, and of civilian losses among Ukrainians, non-Jewish 
Poles, Byelorussians, and Russians each of which ran into several millions.-

B ATT-101 

In the early hours of 13 July 1942, the men of the German Reserve Police I 
Battalion 101 were roused before dawn at the Polish village of Jozefow, and 
driven to the nearby town of Otwock. They were not told what awaited 
them. On arrival, they were ordered by their SS officers to seize all the able- 
bodied Jewish males in the town, and to shoot all the Jewish women, 
children, and elderly. That day, they killed about 1,500 persons, the first 
instalment of the Battalion's estimated total of over 83,000 victims. 

In 1962-72, 210 ex-members of Battalion 101 were examined by West 
German prosecutors, who prepared detailed files on them. They had all been 
non-Party, middle-aged, largely working-class conscripts from Hamburg, 
one of the least Nazified cities in Germany. They were the most ordinary of 
Germans. Almost all expressed revulsion at their wartime duties; and many 
claimed to be innocent of direct killing. But the great majority took part. 'It 
was easier for them to shoot': 

In every modern society, bureaucratisation and specialisation attenuate the 





sense of personal responsibility of those implementing official policy. The 
peer group exerts tremendous pressure on behaviour and sets moral norms. If 
the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101 could become killers under such 
circumstances, what group of men cannot? 1 

For obvious reasons, little is known about Jews who were placed in a 
similar moral position to that of Battalion 101. Very few survived. Yet it was 
standard practice for the SS to employ Jewish policemen in the ghettos and 
to recruit Jewish Sonderkommandos for the worst tasks in the death-camps. 
Carel Perechodnik was one such recruit. He was an educated man, who 
joined the Jewish police force in the Otwock ghetto in the hope of avoiding 
death and feeding his family. He obeyed Nazi orders, and lived quite well. 
With the help of non-Jewish friends, he escaped to 'the Aryan side', where 
he lived long enough to write his memoirs. The memoirs are called Am I a 
Murderer? 2 

For anyone unfamiliar with Eastern Europe, the activities of the 
communist political police which flooded Poland in 1944-5 are still harder 
to believe. Popular knowledge in the country has always insisted that the 
notorious communist Security Office (UB) contained a disproportionate 
number of Jews (or rather ex-Jews), and that their crimes were heinous. But 
few hard facts were ever published, and the stories remained 
unsubstantiated. Recent disclosures, however, have broken the taboo. They 
are all the more convincing since they were made by a Jewish investigator 
on evidence supplied by Jewish participants, and in the spirit of Jewish 
redemption. The study deals with the district of Upper Silesia, and in 
particular with the town of Gliwice (Gleiwitz). It concludes that in 1945 
every single commander and three-quarters of the local agents of the UB 
were of Jewish origin; that ex-Nazi camps and prisons were refilled with 
totally innocent civilians, especially Germans; and that torture, starvation, 
sadistic beatings, and murder were routine. The number of deaths inflicted 
by the communist regime on the German population is estimated at 60- 
80,000. In this light, it is difficult to justify the widespread practice whereby 
the murderers, the victims, and the bystanders of wartime Poland are each 
neatly identified with specific ethnic groups. 3 


For many years after the War, two round figures enjoyed wide circulation: 




'six million' Holocaust victims overall, and 'four million' dead in Auschwitz. 
The first figure, though somewhat high, is likely to stand. The second figure was 
impossible. Auschwitz received two people who were later proclaimed Christian 
saints. The Blessed Edith Stein was a Jewish convert to Catholicism, captured by 
the Nazis in Holland. Father Maximilian Kolbe was a Catholic priest who gave 
his life to save a married inmate from death. Fifty years later, pain was still being 
caused by attempts to find appropriate ways of commemorating the 
multinational and multi-confessional character of the victims.- 

At the time, one of the main problems lay in the fact that the outside world 
could not be made to grasp the enormity of what was happening. As early as 
September 1940 a courageous officer of the Polish Underground, Witold Pilecki 
(1901-48), had succeeded in penetrating Auschwitz I. He spent two years 
organizing secret resistance cells inside the camp, before escaping.- Yet the 
information gathered was not judged credible outside Poland. When the Polish 
Government in Exile in Eondon published a report on the fate of Poland's Jews, 
a leading Jewish member of the Government committed suicide in desperation at 
the feeble response.- When a Polish courier visited Washington to give an eye¬ 
witness account of the death camps, he was countered by the chilling words of 
Chief Justice Frankfurter: 'We don't say that you're lying, but...' American Jews 
were no more spurred to action than anyone else.- When the proposal was 
eventually made to bomb the approaches to Auschwitz, the Allied Powers found 
reasons to refuse.- Stalin had killed his millions in the 1930s without significant 
world reaction. Hitler was able to do the same in the 1940s until outsiders saw 
the evidence with their own eyes, [auschwitz] 

The Holocaust has inspired a vast corpus of literature. Its leading historians 
are nearly all Jewish scholars who believe fervently in its uniqueness. They 
reject 'the oecumenical nature of evil'- just as they reject the old question: 
'Why do you come with your special Jewish sorrows?'- Even so, much variety 
of emphasis prevails. Elie Wiesel is credited with turning the term 'Holocaust' to 
its present usage.- Lucy Dawidowicz argued for the premeditated nature of the 
Nazis' genocidal programme.- Raul Hilberg saw the Holocaust as the 
culmination of two millennia of Christian antisemitism.- Yehudah Bauer 
constructed a stark landscape of Nazi 'murderers', Jewish 'victims', and Gentile 
'bystanders'.- Martin Gilbert compiled a heart-rending compendium of 
individual experiences.- 


TAIZE 


One day in August 1940, soon after the fall of France, a 25-year-old 
theology student from Switzerland wandered into the little Burgundian town 
of Cluny. He was writing a thesis on pre-Benedictine monasticism. He was 
less interested in the ruins of the monastery than in the vague possibility of 
founding a monastic community himself. He was the son of a Protestant 
pastor from the district of Neuchatel, until recently a confused agnostic. He 
saw a sign 'House for Sale in Taize', cycled the 10 km up the valley, and 
bought the house in the half-empty village. He was Roger-Louis Schutz- 
Marsauche. 1 

Wartime Taize lay close to the demarcation line between the German- 
occupied and the Vichy zones. The self-appointed monk lived there 
intermittently and alone. For two years he devoted himself to sheltering 
Jewish refugees until the Gestapo carried his guests away. In September 
1944, after the Liberation, he returned again, and took to sheltering German 
prisoners of war. The villagers reacted violently, and one of the prisoners, an 
ailing Catholic priest, was killed. At the war's end Roger was joined by his 
sister, Genevieve, and together they provided a home for twenty rural 
orphans. Seven more 'brothers' arrived. As non-Catholics, they had to apply 
for special permission to use the deserted parish church. When permission 
was granted in 1948, it bore the signature of the Papal Nuncio, Cardinal 
Roncalli. 

The Community of Taize defies classification. It has no formal rule, and 
belongs to no denomination. It is inspired by the Beatitudes in their purest 
form-Joy, Simplicity, Mercy, by the service of youth, by the mission of 
reconciliation, and by a powerful idea, which is the subject of Brother 
Roger's book, The Dynamic of the Provisional (1965). It is instantly 
recognizable from the unique 'Taize Sound'-the sound of energetic young 
voices singing the simplest of words and melodies in rhythmic, incanta-tory, 
four-part harmony. 

Once the Church of Reconciliation was built on the nearby hill in 1962, 
it became the focus of a world-wide movement, of two-way traffic devoted 
to the perpetual 'Council of Youth', and the 'pilgrimage of tmst on earth'. 
Eighty white-robed brothers manned a spiritual generator which reached out 



to all continents. Missions set out for Asia, Africa, Latin America, New 
York. Wherever there were human divisions, the spirit of Taize sought to 
heal them. Initially shunned both by the World Council of Churches and by 
the Vatican, it won them both over. In Europe it found the support of the 
Orthodox Patriarch of Constantinople and of the then Archbishop of Cracow. 
In the 1980s it breached the Iron Curtain, when its European meetings 
moved on from St Peter's and St Paul's to East Berlin and to Warsaw. 

Contemporary European Christianity has produced a number of inspirational 
figures who have transcended all existing barriers. One was Agnes Gonxha 
Bojaxhiu (b. 1910, Skopje), an Albanian nun better known as Mother Teresa 
of Calcutta. 2 Another was a Dutchman, Father Werenfried van Straaten, 
founder of 'Aid to the Church in Need'. 3 A third such person, of simple heart 
and unsimple name, is without doubt Brother Roger. 'One passes through 
Taize', said John Paul II, 'as one passes a spring of water.' 


Dissentient voices betray little uniformity. Non-Zionist witnesses, such as 
Marek Edelman, the last living leader of the Warsaw Ghetto Rising, have been 
pilloried for opposing the dominant Zionist viewpoint.- One scholar 
maintained that the Holocaust arose from unforeseen circumstances in 1941.- 
Another tried to show that the Jewish tragedy should be judged within the wider 
context of the Nazi Terror in general.- A group of dubious publicists centred on 
the Journal of Historical Review has sought to maintain either that the 'gas 
chamber stories' were a hoax, or that the statistics were vastly inflated. The 
liveliest debate which they provoke concerns their own right to be tolerated.- 
Other critics complain that 'the Holocaust industry' has exploited Jewish 
suffering for political ends.- The film-maker Claude Lanzmann won less than 
universal acceptance for his evocative film Shoah (1984), which many people 
mistook for documentary history.- For passions still rage. The last word has 
still to be spoken. 

No European country was more scarred by the Holocaust than Poland. 
Jewry's thousand-year Polish abode virtually came to an end. An important 
element in Poland's population and culture had been torn out. Future generations 
of Polish citizens would have to bear not only the degrading memory of 
atrocities perpetrated in their homeland but also a humiliating legacy of 





recrimination, misinformation, and moral confusion. Only those who were both 
Polish and Jewish could fully comprehend the trauma. 'The paths of the two 
saddest nations on this earth have parted for ever.'- [buczacz] 

The German attack on the USSR rapidly transformed the world's diplomatic 
alliances. Since August 1939 the Centre and the East of Europe's threefold 
power structure had been partners. They were now mortal enemies. This opened 
the way for the remnant of the third power centre, Great Britain, to join the 
Soviet Union and to rebuild a new version of the diplomatic system of the First 
World War. The West would now combine with the East to hold the Centre, 
before bringing in the USA to tip the balance. The Great Triangle was 
resurrected. For Churchill, a lifelong anti-communist, this meant 'speaking well 
of the Devil himself'. For Stalin, it offered the only possible source of 
assistance. An Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance was signed in Moscow 
on 12 July 1941. The German-Soviet pact was formally annulled. Stalin was 
even persuaded to swallow his pride over Poland, and to sign an alliance with 
Britain's other ally, the Polish Government in London. The Soviet-Polish 
military convention of July 1941 was followed by a political treaty. An 
'Amnesty' was to be granted for the millions of innocent Polish deportees and 
prisoners in the USSR; and a new Polish army was to be formed in the depths of 
Russia. The command was given to General Anders, freshly released from the 
dungeons of the Lyubianka. It was the start of a famous Odyssey.- 


AUSCHWITZ 

On 31 May 1944, a British 'Mosquito' reconnaissance plane of 60 Photo 
Squadron took off from an airbase at Brindisi in southern Italy. Its mission 
was to fly some 900 miles to German-occupied Poland and to photograph a 
synthetic fuel factory in the town of Oewiwcim (Auschwitz). By chance, 
since the South African crew left the camera running, the final frames of 
their film shot at 27,000 feet caught the first ever bird's-eye view of the two 
nearby SS-concentration camps of Auschwitz I and Auschwitz II-Birkenau. 1 

Many such pictures were subsequently obtained by Allied 
reconnaissance flights. One photograph taken over Auschwitz-Birkenau 





from a lower altitude on 25 August 1944 was sharp enough to show a line of 
new arrivals being marched under guard from the railway ramp towards the 
open gate of Crematorium No. 2. The trains in the siding, the roof vents of 
the gas chamber, the chimneys of the furnaces, and groups of prisoners are 
all visible. 2 Later pictures, in December, showed that the dismantling of the 
crematoria had already begun. 

Aerial photography is a valuable tool in several branches of historical 
research. It is widely used by archaeologists, by urbanologists, and by 
landscape analysts. In this case, it supplied a convincing item in the proof of 
a genocidal campaign that post-war 'revisionists' have sought to deny. 

Partial knowledge of the Nazi death-camps had been available in the 
West since late 1942, when the exiled Polish Government in London 
published information supplied by its underground couriers. Despite this, the 
Allied Powers did not see fit to take action. 3 The identification of Auschwitz 
II as the 'unknown destination' to which Jews from all over Europe were 
being deported, was only confirmed from the accounts of five escapees in 
July 1944. 4 

From then on, repeated appeals were made by Zionist groups who hoped 
that the murders might be disrupted by bombing the camp installations and 
railway tracks. The appeals fell on deaf ears. Air force officers insisted on 
the priority of their military and industrial targets. One official of the British 
Foreign Office minuted: 'a disproportionate amount of time ... is wasted ... 
on these wailing Jews.' 5 

The fate of the aerial intelligence pictures is no less instmctive than their 
contents. The films were flown back from Italy for processing and 
interpretation at RAF Medmenham in Buckinghamshire. There, since the 
directors of the operation were only interested in the synthetic fuel factory, 
the last frames on the reels were not checked out. The historic photographs 
of 31 May and 25 August 1944 were found thirty years later in the archives 
of the US Defense Intelligence Agency-unprinted. 6 

Auschwitz was liberated by the Soviet Army on 27 January 1945. Yet the 
Western Governments' urgent requests for detailed information brought no 
further news until an ambiguous telegram arrived from Moscow on 27 April. 
It mentioned 'investigations at Auschwitz' which showed that 'more than 



four million citizens of various countries had been killed'. 7 This figure, if 
applied to the victims of Auschwitz alone, was not compatible with statistics 
produced by Allied prosecutors at Nuremberg. 8 But it was allowed to pass 
into conventional wisdom. Not until the collapse of Communism in 1990 did 
the State Museum at Oewiwcim feel free to release a more credible estimate 
of 1.2-1.5 million victims, 9 of whom probably c.800,000-1.1 million were 
Jews. 

Between the extremes of credulity and incredulity, it took exactly fifty 
years for an approximation of the truth to emerge about one of contemporary 
history's most intensively researched topics. 'After Auschwitz', Theodor 
Adorno said, 'poetry is no longer possible'. It seems that historians, too, lost 
their faculties. 


The crucial step, however, was still to come. Without the USA, the Allied 
Powers amounted to little more than a club for invalids. Churchill and Roosevelt 
signed the Adantic Charter on 11 August, establishing eight common principles. 
These included: 


First-their countries seek no aggrandizement, territorial or other... . Third-they respect the right of 
all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live ... Eighth-they believe that all of 
the nations of the world, for realistic as well as spiritual reasons, must come to the abandonment of the use 
of force.- 


But the US Congress was still unwilling to enter the war. The Soviet 
Government had retired to Kuybyshev on the Volga; its first service to the Allied 
cause was to join the British in a joint occupation of Persia. Fortunately for 
London and Moscow, the Japanese proved more persuasive than the Allies. 
When Japanese bombers attacked the US Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor on Hawaii 
on 7 December 1941, they 'awoke the slumbering giant'. Their action had no 
direct connection with the war in Europe; yet it changed American attitudes 
overnight. America's war-shyness evaporated; the Congress voted lavish war 
credits; and the hands of the President were untied. It was not part of the 
Japanese plan; but they had unwittingly unlocked the doors of the Grand 
Alliance. 'The Big Three'-the war-winning trio of Churchill, Stalin, and 
Roosevelt-were in business. 

The Germans, of course, felt cheated. They had sought no quarrel with the 





USA, if only the President would stop helping the British. In any case, they were 
counting on finishing the war before the Americans could intervene. So Berlin 
opted for bravado: Hitler declared war on the USA in a speech to the Reichstag 
on 11 December 1941. 

In its way, the emergence of the Grand Alliance was every bit as shocking as 
that of the Nazi-Soviet partnership two years earlier. Every principle of the 
Anglo-Saxon democracies was contradicted by the Soviet system. Nor was it just 
a matter of forgetting Stalin's past crimes. The Western leaders had to close their 
minds to the fact that Stalin continued to kill perhaps a million of his own people 
every year throughout the war. But when Stalin was weak and Hitler was strong, 
Stalin had to be helped. By Stalin's standards, the Western democracies were 
every bit as nauseating and 'anti-socialist' as the Fiihrer. But with the Wehrmacht 
at the gates of Moscow, the helping hand of the West had to be accepted; 
ideological niceties did not enter the reckoning. Though the anti-Nazi alliance 
was to be wrapped in the verbiage of freedom, democracy, and justice, the Big 
Three were bound together by cynical convenience. 

For the time being, the Grand Alliance could do little to challenge German 
hegemony in Europe. The immediate tasks were to secure their lines of 
communication, to limit Germany's further advance, to damage Germany's war 
industries, and to construct the basis for offensive action in the future. To these 
ends the Anglo-Americans combined to fight the Battle of the Atlantic; they 
planned a vast campaign of aerial bombing; and they undertook to supply the 
Soviet Union with war material. Everything depended on the Red Army's ability 
to avoid collapse, on Britain's ability to preserve its island fortress, and on the 
Americans' ability to muster their colossal resources for simultaneous wars in 
the Pacific and in Europe, [oxfam] 

The Battle of the Atlantic secured the sea lanes which guaranteed Britain's 
lifeline to the USA and the USA's gateway to Europe. 21,194,000 tons of Allied 
shipping, 77,000 British sailors, and 70 per cent of all German U-boats were to 
be lost before the seas would be cleared of raiders. The U-boats' bases were 
invulnerable: the abortive British raid on St Nazaire in March 1942 highlighted 
the contrast between the Allies' mastery of the sea with Germany's supremacy 
on land. Anti-submarine measures, including the convoy system, aerial patrols, 
and sonar, took months and months to be deployed. Allied shipping losses 
peaked in March 1943, immediately before the U-boats met their own 
catastrophe. The sinking of 41 U-boats in conjunction with Convoy ONS-5 



forced Admiral Donitz to withdraw his submarines from the Atlantic for good. 


OXFAM 

The Oxford Committee for Famine Relief began its career in the University 
Church of St Mary the Virgin on 5 October 1942. Its immediate purpose was 
to alleviate distress caused by the war in Greece. It was by no means the sole 
agency devoted to international humanitarian relief: the International Red 
Cross had been operating out of Geneva since 1863, when it was formed by 
Henri Dunant as a result of horrors witnessed at the Battle of Solferino. In 
the First World War campaigns had been organized to assist war victims in 
Belgium, Serbia [flora], and Galicia. In 1918-21 the American Relief 
Administration (ARA) provided enormous assistance, especially in Eastern 
Europe, as did UNRRA after 1945. Almost all the combatant countries, 
including Germany, had operated some form of relief agency. Yet Oxfam 
had several advantages. Like the IRC, it was independent of government 
policy. Also, being based in one of the Allied states, it did not cease to 
function at war's end. Thirdly, being British, it had ready access via the 
Empire to all the continents. It was well placed when the focus for 
international relief shifted away from Europe. 1 

The history of the relief agencies inevitably reflected Europe's changing 
position in the world. Post-war affluence created a huge economic 
discrepancy between 'North' and 'South' at the very time that the 'West' was 
confronting 'the East'. The USA was more preoccupied with politics than 
previously; the Soviet bloc was not involved in humanitarian issues; and the 
UN was somewhat constricted by member governments. So an important 
role was left to private organizations from post-imperial Europe such as 
Oxfam, Save the Children, CAFOD (Catholic Fund for Overseas 
Development), and Medecins Sans Frontieres. The North-South Commission 
(1978-83) and the associated Brandt Report established the target figure of 1 
per cent of GNP whereby the wealthier nations should aim to assist the 
'Third World'. But in 1992-3 the disasters in ex-Yugoslavia emphasized the 
fact that Europe's own agonies were far from finished. 





As from the first 1,000-bomber raid on Cologne on 31 May 1942, the Allied 
bombing offensive rose steadily to a mighty crescendo. It has been strongly 
criticized both on practical and on moral grounds. Precision bombing, such as 
the famous 'Dam-Buster Raid' on the reservoirs of the Ruhr Basin or the 
elimination of the Nazis' heavy-water plant at Telemark in Norway, had clear 
objectives. But the wholesale destruction of German cities by fire-bombing, and 
the attempt to terrorize the civilian population, did not achieve the expected 
results. In the years between 1941 and 1945,1.35 million tons of high explosive 
were dropped on the Reich by the endless waves of Lancasters, Halifaxes, and 
Flying Fortresses. Counter-measures absorbed a great deal of Germany's 
dwindling resources. But the Nazis' war industries were never halted; and 
German civilians, like their British counterparts under the Blitz, rallied to the 
national cause. One enormous raid on Hamburg in May 1943 caused a fire-storm 
that killed 43,000 innocents. Another on Dresden may have wreaked destruction 
approaching that of the atomic bombs dropped on Japan, [altmarkt] 

Western operations to supply the Soviet Union, which gathered pace from 
1941, were rarely acknowledged by the beneficiaries. The Royal Navy took on 
the hazardous assignment of leading Arctic convoys to Murmansk. Many 
seamen and ships and the best part of one whole convoy, the PQ17, were lost 
without trace. The USA organized huge overland transports into Russia from the 
Persian Gulf. American aid to the USSR under the Lend Lease Scheme was 
estimated at 7 per cent of Soviet military production and $2.8 billion in non¬ 
military supplies. 

Allied political plans took shape round the Atlantic Charter and the 
Washington Pact of 1 January 1942, whereby the twenty-six states at war with 
the Axis Powers undertook not to sign a separate peace. These states formed the 
kernel which grew in the space of four years into the United Nations, the 
successor to the League. 

As soon as the Grand Alliance started its work, the Anglo-Americans were 
pressed by Stalin to open a second front in Europe. Almost the whole of the 
German war machine was concentrated in the East; and it was entirely 
reasonable for Stalin to ask his allies to share the burden. He himself possessed 
larger reserves of trained manpower than he revealed to anyone-which is one 
reason why the Red Army consistently exceeded German estimates of its 
capacity. Even so, there was a huge disproportion between the 150 German 
divisions which the Red Army had to face and the 4 assigned to the only other 



front then operating, in North Africa. The Anglo-Americans, however, had no 
easy means to oblige. Their air power drew the Luftwaffe away from the Volga 
at a crucial moment; and they eventually took a larger number of Axis prisoners 
in Africa than were taken at Stalingrad. But they could not project their strength 
onto the European mainland. Every single Continental port was in enemy hands, 
and a vast Atlantic wall of coastal defences was under construction in northern 
France. An abortive raid on Dieppe showed what fearsome obstacles awaited 
any major Allied landing force. Neither the British nor the Americans possessed 
trained reserves. Stalin was told that a major offensive would be launched in the 
West in 1943; it did not materialize until June 1944. Before that, the only relief 
which the Anglo-Americans could bring to the main land war was on the 
southern periphery, in Italy. 

The hard-fought Italian campaign developed from the Allies' growing 
strength throughout the Mediterranean. Contrary to expectations, the British held 
on to Malta and the sea route to Suez; and Anglo-American landings on the 
western extremities of North Africa spelled mortal danger for the Afrika Korps. 
Operation Torch soon had the Axis bottled up in Tunisia, whence in May 1943 
they were obliged to withdraw completely. Thereafter it was a relatively simple 
step for the Allies to cross the Sicilian Straits, and to attack the toe of the Fascist 
boot. 

The invasion of Sicily began on 10 July 1943, when British and American 
troops landed simultaneously on the southern and eastern shores. German 
reinforcements arrived too late to prevent the rapid conquest of the whole island. 
From Sicily, the Allies jumped across to Calabria in September and began the 
arduous task of pushing northwards up the mountainous peninsula; in all, the 
task was to take them nearly two years. Yet the Allied toehold in southern Italy 
was to have important consequences. Once a major base was established at 
Brindisi, it permitted the projection of Allied air power onto a wide range of 
destinations throughout Central and Eastern Europe, including Poland and 
Yugoslavia. It forced the German Command to commit ill-spared divisions to the 
occupation of southern France. Most importantly, it provoked the collapse of 
Mussolini's regime. On 25 July 1943 Marshal Badoglio persuaded the King of 
Italy to dismiss the Duce and to accede to Allied overtures. The Duce was saved 
from arrest on the Gran Sasso in a sensational rescue by German paratroopers, 
and lived again to rule a German-sponsored Republic of Northern Italy from 
Milan. But the first major crack in the Axis fortress could not be concealed. 



Meanwhile, on the Eastern Front, the gigantic German-Soviet War was 
moving to its climax. Having survived the disaster of 1941, the Soviet regime 
moved to tap the great reservoir of Russian patriotism. Stalin reopened the 
Orthodox churches which he had all but annihilated, and appealed like Lenin 
before him for the defence of Holy Russia. What seemed impossible at any time 
before 1941, millions of men went willingly to their deaths with 'Za Stalina' 
(For Stalin) on their lips. The Red Army's prodigal use of its expendable 
manpower amazed and, to a degree, demoralized the German soldiery. Waves of 
infantry were used to assault fixed positions with no sign of artillery support. 
Through fields of mounting corpses, the hordes of ill-clothed and ill-armed 
'Ivans' kept coming and coming, till the German machine-guns overheated and 
the gunners lost stomach for the slaughter. It was an accepted fact of the contest 
that the Soviet side could sustain casualties of three or four to one and still carry 
the day. The Red Army's sacrifices were helped by the wilderness and the 
weather, and by the T-34, the best tank of the war. A brilliant military team led 
by Marshal Zhukov maximized the advantages of space and numbers. 

In 1942 the Wehrmacht was drawn on and on. The constant series of local 
German successes concealed the fact that the elusive Soviet enemy was not now 
being trapped or encircled, and that the long lines of communication were 
growing ever longer. By the early autumn, as the weather deteriorated, neither 
the Volga nor the Caspian had been reached; and a dangerous salient was 
developing on the approaches to Stalingrad. A tactical withdrawal might have 
remedied the situation. But the Fiihrer adamantly refused. Hitler must take the 
sole blame for the fateful order which told General von Paulus to hold his 
ground at all costs. The Germans' momentum eventually took them to the right- 
bank suburbs of 'Stalin's city'. Yet they were entering the head of a noose. Day 
after day, Zhukov's forces inched round the German flanks, until, in one sudden 
movement, von Paulus was finally surrounded. Three months of desperate hand- 
to-hand fighting in icy, deserted ruins preceded von Paulus's surrender on 2 
February 1943. Stalingrad cost over one million lives. It was the largest single 
battle of world history. The invincible Nazi colossus was shown to be fallible. 

News of Stalingrad flashed round the world, giving heart to anti-Nazi 
resistance movements all over Europe. Before Stalingrad, Resistance leaders had 
only been able to indulge in small-scale sabotage, or to run the clandestine 
escape lines for Allied airmen and prisoners. After Stalingrad, they began to 
dream of liberation. 



In Western Europe, resistance was relatively uncomplicated. Prompted by the 
broadcasts of the BBC, and by the skulduggery of the British Special Operations 
Executive (SOE), devoted cells of courageous men and women planned the 
sabotage and diversions which would eventually help the advance of the Allied 
armies. In Denmark, where the Nazis had hoped to create a model protectorate, 
the Resistance forced the Germans in August 1943 to declare martial law. In 
Norway, too, the Nazis abandoned the attempt to rule through the pro-Fascist 
government of Vidkun Quisling. Their one and only shipment of heavy water 
from the Norsk-Hydro Plant was sunk in the Tinnsjo fiord by Norwegian 
saboteurs. In 'the Netherlands they were less disturbed, having penetrated the 
Dutch Resistance in a brilliant project called the Englandspiel, the 'English 
Game 5 . In Belgium, France, Italy, and Greece, the resistance was increasingly 
influenced by communist elements. The French resistance came to life after 
1942 with the German occupation of the Vichy Zone, where large numbers of 
patriots took to the maquis. At the same time the Italian partisans, whose 
achievements were still greater, concentrated their activities in the northern zone 
mled by Mussolini, whom they eventually captured and killed. 

Yet nowhere was popular defiance more determined than in tiny Luxemburg. 
In the plebiscite of October 1941, only 3 per cent of Luxemburgers voted for 
joining the Reich. Later, they organized the only effective general strike against 
Nazi rule, whilst sustaining a ceaseless campaign of obstructions and 
propaganda. 

In Eastern Europe, Resistance was more problematical. German policies 
there were far harsher. Despite very different political colorations, the leading 
formations of the Underground-the democratic Polish Armia Krajowa (Home 
Army, AK), the undemocratic Ukrainian Insurrectionary Army (UPA), and the 
Serbian Cetniks -were all caught in a painful political trap, where the pursuit of 
national freedom demanded resistance to Stalin as well as to Hitler. Co-operation 
with the advancing Red Army, or with communist partisans, who did not 
recognize the principle of 'bourgeois independence', involved at best abject 
surrender, more usually imprisonment and death, [buczacz] 

In Poland, for example, the largest and most senior of Europe's Resistance 
movements faced an almost impossible task. It came into being in late 1939, 
when it treated both the Nazis and the Soviets as occupation forces. Its main 
formation, the Armia Krajowa (AK), was a loose federation of ill-assorted 
groups. Its authority was respected by the numerous Peasant Battalions (BCh), 



but not by the semi-fascist (but violently anti-German) National Armed Forces 
(NSZ) or by the communist People's Guard (GL). It had proper, if slight, 
relations with the Jewish Fighting Organization (ZOB) in the ghettos-and 
bloody confrontations with the Ukrainians, the Soviet partisans, and the gangs of 
deserters, fugitives, and bandits with whom it shared the woods. It organized and 
ran an impressive 'Secret State'-with clandestine intelligence, diversionary, 
educational, judicial, and political branches. But it did not survive the Soviet 
'Liberation'. Its democratic leaders ended up in a Moscow show trial. 
Honourable men, like the unbroken General Okulicki, the AK's last Commander, 
deserve to stand amongst the heroes of the Allied cause. Instead, amidst the 
shameful silence of their comrades in the West, they were consigned to 
obscurity, dishonour, and an early grave.- 

In Yugoslavia, the problem was solved by a controversial and, some would 
say, disreputable decision of the Anglo-Americans. Yugoslavia, unlike Poland, 
layout-side the sphere of direct Soviet influence. But in 1943 it came within 
range of Allied support from Italy. London and Washington chose to back Tito's 
communists. Thereafter, Tito's rivals, the Cetniks, were heaped with every form 
of calumny. Their leaders, including Mihajlovi, would eventually be executed by 
Tito's courts for 'treason'. 

Such developments well illustrate the facile definitions of 'resistance' and 
'collaboration' which prevailed in Anglo-American circles. Nations who have 
never experienced foreign invasion rarely comprehend its complications. Of 
course, some people in continental Europe chose to serve the invaders from base 
motives of personal gain. Others, like Leon Degrelle's Rexist Movement in 
Belgium, acted in accordance with principles developed before the war. But 
many were moved to collaborate in order to exert a moderating influence and to 
limit the harm done. In France, after Petain's fateful meeting with Hitler, the 
policy of collaboration may or may not have been misguided. But it was coined 
for reasons of patriotic necessity. 

In the broad expanse of Europe that was successively occupied both by 
Soviets and by Nazis, the element of choice was largely absent. Both totalitarian 
regimes sought to enforce obedience through outright terror. For most ordinary 
civilians, the prospect of serving the Soviets posed the same moral dilemmas as 
serving the fascists. The only course of principled action for patriots and 
democrats was the suicidal one of trying to oppose Hitler and Stalin 
simultaneously. 


After Stalingrad, the news from the Eastern Front continued to be 
disheartening for Berlin. In the spring of 1943, the Red Army moved to the 
general offensive for the first time in two years. In the opening stages of five 
mighty campaigns that would carry them all the way to Berlin, Stalin's confident 
marshals began to roll back the Nazi enemy. On the open steppe near Kursk in 
July, the Germans' strategic tank-force was smashed. Their capacity for large- 
scale attack was broken. The tide, to use Churchill's metaphor, had turned. 


BUCZACZ 

The deaconry of buczacz. In 1939, this district was inhabited by 45.314 
Poles. Among its 17 parishes, Barycz numbered 4,875, Buczacz 10,257. 
Koropiec 2,353, Kowalowka 3,009, Monasterzyska 7,175 ... In Barycz, a 
couple of Polish families were murdered by Ukrainians in 1939 ... One of 
the Biernackis had a leg severed ... But the main attack took place on the 
night of 5-6 July 1944, when 126 Poles were killed. Men, women and 
children were shot, or hacked to death with axes. The "Mazury" ward of the 
town was burned down. The attackers were armed with machine guns and 
shouted "Rizaty, palyty" (kill, burn). The survivors fled to Buczacz, where 
they survived the winter in terrible conditions, in ex-Jewish houses without 
doors or windows... 

The [Catholic] parish of Nowostawce, though sparsely inhabited, 
contained three Greek-Catholic parishes within its bounds. The ratio of Poles 
to Ukrainians was 2 : 3. In 1939 co-existence was still possible. But 
conditions worsened after the German Occupation. In 1944, when the 
German-Soviet front line passed through, nothing but ruins remained ... 

The vicar of Korosciatyn reported an attack on his village on 28 
February 1944. 78 persons were shot, smothered or axed in the vicarage 
cellar... Some ninety people had perished in an earlier attack in 1943. Then 
typhus carried off a further fifty. A curious thing occurred. The village had 
thirteen so-called "wild marriages". All of them died except one. 

In Koropiec, no Poles were actually murdered. But it was reported that 
the Greek-Catholic pulpits resounded to calls regarding mixed Polish- 
Ukrainian marriages: "Mother, you're suckling an enemy-strangle it.'" 1 




Forty years after the event, the Roman Catholic Church in Poland was still 
trying to document the wartime 'ethnic cleansing' perpetrated in the former 
eastern provinces of Galicia and Volhynia. Estimates of casualties range 
from 60,000 to 500.000. 2 

Buczacz, or Buchach, was one of scores of districts which shared a 
similar fate. It lay in the Archdiocese of Lwow which covered all of Red 
Ruthenia (East Galicia) and beyond. Its pre-war population was made up of 
Ukrainians, Poles, and Jews. All three communities were scourged by Soviet 
repressions at the start of the war. Then the Jews were killed by the Nazis 
and their local collaborators. After that, the Poles were attacked by 
Ukrainians. Finally, the returning Soviets destroyed anyone and everyone 
connected with independent organizations. 

Ethnic cleansing in wartime Poland was started in 1939-41 both by the 
Nazis, who cleared several western regions for German resettlement, and by 
the Soviets, who deported millions from the East. After 1941, it was taken 
up by small factions of the Polish underground, who sought to drive out 
Ukrainians from central Poland, and on a far larger scale by the Ukrainian 
Insurrectionary Army (UPA), who terrorized Poles. In 1945, the communists 
completed the cleansing of Poles from Ukraine and, through 'Operation 
Vistula', of Ukrainians from their homes in 'People's Poland'. At Potsdam, 
Allied policyapproved the expulsion of all Germans f rom east of the Oder 
(see p. 1047). 

The UPA came into being in October 1942 to initiate an exclusive, 
nationalist Ukraine and to oppose the growing bands of Soviet partisans 
infiltrated behind German lines. (Its commander, General Roman Shukevich, 
'Chuprynka', fought on until captured in 1950.) However, when the rising 
communist tide had been stemmed neither by the Wehrmacht nor by the 
formation of the SS Galizien, the Ukrainian underground adopted desperate 
solutions. Western Ukraine was heading for the return either of Soviet or of 
Polish rule. The more radical elements then decided to wipe out their most 
vulnerable adversaries, namely Polish civilians. 3 They had no compunction 
in killing anyone who opposed them: 

11 March 1943. In the Ukrainian village of Litogoszcz (Volhynia), Ukrainian 
nationalists murdered a Polish school teacher whom they had abducted. 
Together with this Pole they murdered several Ukrainian families who 



opposed the massacre. 4 

In a conflict with strong religious undercurrents, the clergy were selected 
for bestial treatment: 

Revd Ludwik Wlodarczyk from Okopy was crucified; Revd Stanistaw 
Dobrzanski from Ostrowka was beheaded with an axe: Revd Karol Baran 
was sawn in half in Korytnica; Revd Zawadzki had his throat slit.. . 5 

In post-war Eastern Europe, all war crimes were officially ascribed to the 
Nazis. Victims from areas like Buczacz were lumped together in the 'Twenty 
Million Russian War Dead', or otherwise hidden by silence. 6 The 
multinational dimensions of the tragedy were not appreciated. All 
nationalities have been guilty of publicizing their own losses, and of 
ignoring others, although one sometimes meets accounts of shared suffering: 

Between May and December 1942, more than 140,000 Volhynian Jews were 
murdered. Some who had been given refuge in Polish homes were murdered 
together with their Polish protectors in the spring of 1943, when, of 300,000 
Poles living in Volhynia, 40,000 were murdered by Ukrainian 'bandits'. In 
many villages, Poles and Jews fought together against the common foe. 7 

But no overall, even-handed survey of wartime genocide has been 
undertaken. Attempts to establish Polish or Catholic losses, for example, 
inevitably sideline Jewish and Ukrainian losses. They stress the role of 
Jewish and Ukrainian collaborators in the Soviet service, or of Ukrainian 
units under German command. They are not concerned with the activities of 
Silesian Poles in German Schupo units, nor with the Polish co-operation with 
the Soviet Army. It is not part of their brief to count the UPA's Jewish and 
Ukrainian victims. Any exercise which looks at one side alone is bound to 
generate distortions. 

Buczacz, incidentally, was the home town of Simon Wiesenthal, Nazi- 
hunter extraordinary. 8 


The Triumph of the Grand Alliance (July 1943-May 1945). From mid-1943 the 
Grand Alliance held the upper hand in almost every sphere. The Reich, though 
fighting hard, was under siege. The Soviets held the initiative on land. The 




Anglo-Americans held mastery of sea and air. The combined resources of 
American industrial strength, of Russian manpower, and of the British Empire 
could not be matched by Hitler's shrinking realm. There was still no Second 
Front beyond Italy, and no sign of serious opposition inside Germany. Save for 
the Wunderwaffen or 'wonder weapons' which were supposed to reverse the 
Fiihrer's fading fortunes, the demise of the Reich grew ever more likely. 

Despite exaggerated rumours, the intense competition over weapon 
development was real enough. It focused on jet engines, on rocketry, and on the 
atomic bomb. German scientists won two of the three contests outright. A 
prototype of the jet-powered Messerschmitt 262 flew in 1942. The Vergeitung or 
'revenge' rockets, the Vi and V2, were developed at Peenemunde on the Baltic, 
and targeted on Fondon from June 1944. But the race for the atomic bomb was 
won by the Allies' Manhattan Project in distant New Mexico. Its success, in July 
1945, came too late for the European war. 

For the Allies, the most acute problems lay in the realm of political and 
strategic co-ordination. To this end, three personal meetings of the 'Big Three' 
were organized-at Teheran (December 1943), at Yalta (February 1945), and at 
Potsdam (June 1945). Three major issues underlay their discussions-the 
definition of war aims, the priorities of the Pacific and the European War, and 
the plans for post-war Europe. On war aims, the Grand Alliance decided to insist 
on the unconditional surrender of the Reich. This was done partly in deference to 
Stalin's suspicions about a Second Front, partly in recognition of the mistakes of 
1918. The effect, whilst binding the Alliance together, was to give the Soviet 
Union a licence for its totalitarian designs in the East. Once the Western leaders 
had renounced the possibility of withdrawing from the conflict, they surrendered 
the strongest lever for moderating Soviet conduct. 

The clash of priorities between the war against Germany and the war against 
Japan was especially acute for the Americans, who alone were carrying a major 
share in both conflicts. It was to come to a head at Yalta. The Soviets had 
observed strict neutrality towards Japan since 1941, and were not likely to 
change their position until the European war was over. The British, in contrast, 
were deeply involved in the Japanese war. Their fragile lines to the Far East 
were stretched very thin, and great reliance had to be placed on the independent 
war effort of the dominions, especially of Australia and New Zealand. Singapore 
had fallen, dramatically, at an early stage. Thereafter, Britain's participation was 
confined to Burma (where the Japanese sphere lapped the borders of British 



India) and to auxiliary support for the Americans. 

Plans for the future of Europe never reached full agreement. The Western 
Allies excluded Stalin from considerations about Western Europe, starting with 
Italy, and Stalin pressed on regardless with his own dispositions in the East. An 
important exception lay in the so-called 'Percentages Agreement' which 
Churchill discussed with Stalin during his visit to Moscow in October 1944. It 
was never formally adopted; but there is some reason to think that both sides 
regarded it as a working guideline for the Balkans. Pulling half a sheet of paper 
from his pocket, Churchill is said to have written down a short list of countries 
and alongside it a series of percentages representing the expected balance of 
Western and Russian influence. After puffing on his pipe, Stalin is said to have 
placed a neat blue tick against the following: 



Russia 

Others 

Romania 

90% 

10% 

Greece 

10% 

90% 

Yugoslavia 

50% 

50% 

Hungary 

50% 

50% 

Bulgaria 

75% 

25%- 


The 'naughty document', as Churchill called it, has not survived in the public 
section of Britain's Public Record Office, and its existence has been questioned. 
What it meant in practice, however, is that Greece was marked down as the sole 
country on the list where Western influence was supposed to prevail. And that is 
what happened. 

Poland was the one country whose future could not be agreed even in 
unofficial outline. Its plight is often seen as the source of the later Cold War. 
Poland, like France, was a member of the original alliance of 1939. Its 
Government in London was fully recognized, its soldiers, sailors, and airmen 
were serving with distinction under both British and Soviet command. In April 
1943 Stalin used the pretext of the Nazis' revelations about Katyn to sever 
relations with the Polish Government. At the same time, in Moscow, he 
recognized the ineptly named Union of Polish Patriots, the core of a Soviet 
puppet regime. In July the Polish Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief, 
General Sikorski, the one Polish politician enjoying universal confidence, was 
killed in an air crash at Gibraltar. From then on the Polish tragedy moved to its 
nemesis. Soviet propaganda was demanding a return to the Ribbentrop-Molotov 


frontier, now conveniently referred to as the Curzon Line. On no sound 
authority, the population of eastern Poland were said to be clamouring for union 
with the USSR; and a Polish Government 'friendly' to Soviet interests was said 
to be essential. These claims bore no close examination; but Western opinion, 
whose admiration for the magnificent Soviet war effort knew no bounds, was 
well disposed to believe them. So, as the Red Army rolled ever deeper into 
Poland, the Western powers pressed their wretched Polish allies to concede. 

Teheran lay at the mid-point of the wartime air route between London and 
Moscow; and it was there from 28 November to 1 December 1943, that 
Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin held their first meeting. They made sufficient 
progress to ensure the continued prosecution of the war. They agreed on the 
urgency of opening the Second Front in France, and on the post-war 
independence of Iran. But they disagreed quite violently over Poland. During a 
blazing row between Eden and Molotov, President Roosevelt 'slept in his chair'. 
The Western leaders conceded that Poland's territory should be moved bodily to 
the West at Germany's expense, to compensate for Stalin's claims; but they kept 
it secret from the Poles. The occasion was hardly auspicious-but it achieved 
enough to restore confidence in the prospect of a joint Allied assault on the 
Reich in the coming year. 

The Red Army's offensives of 1943-5 sustained a masterly drum-beat that 
kept the Wehrmacht constantly reeling. They began in the middle of the Baltic 
States, Byelorussia, and Ukraine and ended with the siege of Berlin. They were 
organized in a series of huge forward leaps, in which colossal concentrations of 
men and material would be massed in front of the Germans' over-stretched lines, 
then unleashed in an irresistible flood. The second such offensive, after Kursk, 
was aimed at the Dnieper, which was defended by the Germans with a wide zone 
of scorched earth. The third, launched in January 1944, was aimed at the distant 
Vistula. The fourth, beginning in August 1944, turned south into the Balkans and 
was aimed at the Danube. The fifth, in January 1945, was aimed at the Oder and 
beyond. 

In each of these movements, the basic tactic was to surround and to envelop 
the points of resistance. Once a defensive fortress was cut off and isolated, it 
could safely be left for destruction at a later date. In this way, several German 
armies were cut off in Courland and left undefeated till the end of the war. Major 
German fortresses in the East, such as Breslau, were still intact when Berlin fell. 
The main thing was to prevent the Wehrmacht from preparing a counter-blow, 



and hence to harry, to harass, and to maul. The Russians knew war on the 
steppes: aggression usually paid off, fixed defence could usually be outflanked. 
As the Plain narrowed, the Wehrmacht's temptation to stand and fight grew 
stronger. Three such choke-points occurred at the Dukla Pass in the Carpathians, 
in the battle for Budapest, and at the line of the Pomeranian Wall. Here Soviet 
and German blood was spilled in profusion. 

The reputation of the Red Army-renamed the Soviet Army in 1944-went 
before it. Given the memories of 1939-41, it was often regarded as an alien force 
even in the Soviet Union. In the Balkans, it was received at best with mixed 
feelings. In Germany, where the troopers were encouraged to murder and rape, it 
provoked panic. The first German village to be freed from the Nazis was 
martyred. Pictures of German women crucified on barn doors were circulated by 
the Nazis to stiffen resistance. Instead, in the winter of 1944-5, the mass of the 
German population took flight. 

The Soviet drive into central Europe was one of the grandest and most 
terrible military operations of modern history. One of the soldiers in its ranks, 
who was himself arrested at the front, wrote of The Juggernaut of Comintern' 
crushing all beneath its wheels.- For, if the Soviet Army brought liberation 
from the hated Nazis, it also brought subjugation to Stalinism. With it came 
looting, rape, common violence, and official terror on a horrific scale. For those 
who saw it, it was an unforgettable sight. As the battered German formations 
pulled back, wave after wave of liberators passed through. First came the front¬ 
line troops, alert, well-clothed, heavily armed. Next came the second-class units 
and punishment battalions, who marched with ammunition but no food. Behind 
them the flotsam of the front-stragglers, camp followers, walking wounded, 
refugees trapped between the lines. At the back rolled the cordon of the NKVD 
in their smart uniforms and American jeeps, shooting all who failed to keep 
going. Finally there came The hordes of Asia', the endless supply columns 
riding on anything that would move westwards-broken-down trucks, hijacked 
peasant carts, ponies, even camels. The contrast between the red-eyed, 
bandaged, and weary German soldiery and the endless truck-loads of fresh-faced 
Slavonic and Asiatic lads told its own story. The Soviet advance into the Balkans 
in August 1944 had important political consequences. Romania changed sides, 
and took the field against her erstwhile Nazi patrons; Hungary was occupied by 
the German army to prevent Budapest from following Bucharest's example. In 
Bulgaria, the royal government was toppled in September. In Yugoslavia, Tito's 
partisans joined up with Soviet troops and freed Belgrade in October. In Greece 


and Albania, both of which lay beyond the line of Soviet occupation, the 
communist underground made preparations to take over. At which point, in 
December, the Soviets ran into the obstinate defence of Budapest; and the 
advance came to a halt until the New Year. 

In the West, the Second Front was finally opened on 6 June 1944, D-Day, when 
British, Canadian, Polish, and American troops landed on the beaches of 
Normandy. Operation Overlord undoubtedly involved the greatest technical feat 
of the war. It demanded the safe disembarkation of hundreds of thousands of 
men and their weapons on a heavily fortified coast, whose defenders had been 
preparing the reception for four years. It succeeded because good planning was 
matched by good luck. Deception measures, which included the bombing of 
false targets in the Pas-de-Calais, confused the German Staff about the location 
of the landings. Hitler, whose hunch about Normandy had been correct, was 
overruled. Air supremacy ensured close support on the beaches and, still more 
importantly, the interdiction of the Germans' powerful armoured reserve. The 
technological marvels included the huge floating dockyards called 'Mulberry 
Harbours' that were towed into position off the Normandy coast, and Pluto 
(Pipeline Under The Ocean) which guaranteed an unlimited supply of petrol. A 
change in the weather, which produced the biggest Channel storm for 25 years, 
ensured that the German commander, General Rommel, went home for the vital 
weekend. 

Rommel's opponent, US General Dwight D. Eisenhower, knew that he 
would only be allowed one throw of the dice. The start was twice postponed. 
With the favourable moon fast on the wane, 156,000 men, 2,000 warships, 4,000 
landing craft, and 10,000 warplanes were held on the alert for days. But then, 
amidst great trepidation, the order was given. In the middle of the night, in the 
subsiding gale, American paratroopers of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions 
jumped into the middle of the German lines. One of them, from Kansas, feigned 
death as he hung suspended from the spire of the Sainte-Mere Eglise. Further 
west, at 'Pegasus Bridge', the first British soldier on French soil, Sgt. Jim 
Wallwork, silently landed his Horsa glider at 00.16 hrs within 30 yards of the 
target, knocking himself unconscious on impact. D Company of the 2nd Oxford 
and Bucks Light Infantry then shot their way across the bridge, captured the lock 
on the Orne Canal, entered the cafe of M. et Mme. Gondree, and spoke the 
words of Liberation: 'It's all right, chum.'- 


Then, in the grey dawn, the steel doors of the landing craft were thrown open 
and the main force waded ashore onto five code-named beaches. Seventy-three 
thousand men of the US 1st Army hit Utah and Omaha; 83,000 men of the 
Second British and First Canadian armies stormed on to Gold, Juno and Sword. 
The shocked German defenders lay low in their bunkers, bombarded by heavy 
shells from unseen warships and mercilessly strafed from the air. Only at 
'bloody Omaha' did they manage to raise a screen of fire to pin the attackers 
down. There, the Texas Rangers heroically scaled the cliff under fire, only to 
find that the gun position on the top had been dismantled. But the setback was 
local. D-Day worked. In addition to their toehold in Italy, the Allies had won 
their fingerhold in France. The Reich could now be pincered from all sides. 

Overlord, however, was slow to develop. When the Wehrmacht recovered 
from its surprise, resistance was fierce. The Americans could not take 
Cherbourg, the principal port of the invasion coast, for three weeks. The British, 
who should have entered Caen on the evening of D-Day, fought their way in on 
D + 34 (9 July). But the logistics outmatched anything that was seen in the East. 
Reinforcements poured into the Mulberries; the petrol flowed smoothly through 
Pluto. When the Americans finally broke through to the rear, the Germans had 
nothing to do but run. Caught at Falaise in an ever-shrinking gap, they ran the 
gauntlet amidst scenes of slaughter. After that, the Allies' road was clear for the 
race to Paris and the drive for the Rhine. 

After two years of defeats, the German Army finally reacted against Hitler. 
On 20 July 1944, at the Fiihrer's eastern HQ, his Wolfschanze near Rastenburg in 
East Prussia (now K^trzyn in Poland), an attempt was made to assassinate him. 
A bomb was left in a briefcase under the heavy oak table of the conference room. 
It exploded in the Fiihrer's presence; he escaped, badly shaken, with a damaged 
arm. It had been planted by Col. Claus von Stauffenberg, a member of the 
Moltkes' aristocratic Kreisau Circle. Its failure, and the horrible fate of the 
plotters, whose slow deaths on meat-hooks were filmed for the Fiihrer's 
enjoyment, discouraged other attempts. Large volumes are written about the 
German Resistance. The role of noble individuals and small groups, such as 
Pastor Bonhoeffer or the 'White Rose', is beyond question. But the fact is that 
they did not achieve their goals.- 

By the time of the bomb plot, Germany's immediate neighbours in Poland and 
France were both eagerly awaiting their freedom. The Soviet army was 


approaching the eastern suburbs of Warsaw. The American army was working its 
way round the western suburbs of Paris. Both cities were filled with various 
groups of resistance fighters directed mainly from London; both were straining 
at the leash to rise against the Nazi oppressor. In Warsaw they were led by the 
underground AK, in Paris by the Free French. 

Paris rose on 19 August. Despite poor intelligence, the idea was to mount 
attacks inside the city and accelerate the Americans' final push. Parts of the 
French Resistance worked with the American Command, which had recognized 
their value in the battles since the Normandy landings. Assailed from all 
quarters, the German garrison pulled back-and the Americans struck. General 
Leclerc's French armoured division, fighting under American command, was 
given the honour of spearheading the advance. The German garrison 
surrendered, having ignored the Fiihrer's order to leave no stone standing. On 25 
August, with snipers still active, General de Gaulle walked magnificently erect 
down the Champs-elysees. The cathedral of Notre-Dame celebrated a great Te 
Deum. Despite the heavy loss of civilians, the population rejoiced. France's pre¬ 
war Third Republic was restored; Paris was free. 

Warsaw had risen on 1 August, almost three weeks before Paris. The plan 
was to co-ordinate attacks inside the city with the Soviets' final push. But the 
Varsovians were not to share the Parisians' success. The intelligence of the 
Polish Resistance was poor; and they found too late that the Soviet Command 
was not going to help. The Soviet generals had used the Polish Underground in 
all the battles since crossing the Polish frontier. But Stalin did not recognize 
independent forces; and he had no intention of letting Poland regain its freedom. 
Assailed from all quarters, the German garrison had began to withdraw. But then 
the Soviets suddenly halted on the very edge of the city. Foul treachery was 
afoot. Moscow Radio, which had called on Warsaw to rise, now denounced the 
leaders of the rising as 'a gang of criminals'. Two German panzer divisions 
moved forward; and the garrison was given time to receive massive 
reinforcements from the most vicious formations of the Nazi reserves. General 
Berling's Polish army, which was fighting under Soviet Command, was 
withdrawn from the Front for defying orders and trying to assist the rising. 
Berling himself was cashiered. Western attempts to supply Warsaw by air from 
Italy were hamstrung by the Soviets' reluctance to let their planes land and 
refuel. Street by street, house by house, sewer by sewer, the insurgents were 
shelled, gunned, and dynamited on one bank of the Vistula, whilst Soviet 
soldiers sunbathed on the opposite bank. In one of several orgies of killing, in 



the suburb of Mokotow, Nazi troops massacred 40,000 helpless civilians in 
scenes reminiscent of the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto in the previous year. 
Weeks after the liberation of Paris, the Warsaw insurgents were still fighting on. 
They surrendered after sixty-three days, on 2 October, when their commander, 
General Bor, walked into German captivity. 2 Their only consolation was to be 
granted combatant status. Despite the sacrifice of 250,000 of its citizens, Warsaw 
remained unfree. Poland's pre-war Republic was not restored. There was no Te 
Deum in the destroyed cathedral of St John. The remaining population was 
evacuated. In his fury, Hitler ordered that no stone of the rebel city was to be left 
standing. The demolition proceeded for three months, whilst the Soviet army, 
with its committee of Polish puppets in tow, watched passively from across the 
river. They did not enter Warsaw's empty, silent, snowbound ruins until 17 
January 1945. 

Despite the Normandy landings, the Western Allies encountered many 
setbacks. In Italy, Rome fell the day before D-Day, but only after the Allied 
armies had been bottled up for months at Monte Cassino. One week after D-Day 
the London blitz was resumed, with the dispatch first of the Vi flying bombs, the 
'doodlebugs', and in September of the V2. An American landing on the French 
Riviera in August was poorly conceived and developed slowly. In the north, 
Brussels was freed amidst great rejoicing on 3 September. But the British 
scheme, under Operation Market Garden, to jump ahead and seize the Rhine 
bridges at Arnhem was a costly disaster. In the centre, in December, in the 
'Battle of the Bulge', the Americans had to absorb the weight of the 
Wehrmacht's last major armoured counter-attack in the Ardennes. At Bastogne, 
where the 101st Airborne was called on to surrender, the resources of the 
German Staff and their translators were finally overpowered by the American 
reply of 'Nuts'. In the Mediterranean, the British army re-entered Greece in 
October, only to find itself with a civil war on its hands. Churchill did not 
hesitate to assist the government in Athens against communist attacks. Before it 
fell, the Reich was allowed to totter on the brink. 

The terminal conquest of Germany in January to May 1945 took place 
amidst scenes never before experienced. In the West, British and American 
bombers were steadily reducing every major German city to hecatombs of rubble 
and corpses. Nazi officials vainly planned their last stand in the Alpine redoubts 
of Austria and Bavaria. In the East, millions of desperate German refugees were 
trekking westwards through the winter. Tens of thousands perished in the sinking 
of the Wilhelm Gustloff and other mercy ships, or on the deathly trail across the 



icebound waters of the Frisches Haff. The Fiihrer's last throw was to draft all 
German males above 14 into the so-called Volkssturm. Most of those schoolboys, 
invalids, and veterans were to die from the Soviet policy of killing anyone in 
German uniform. The compulsory evacuation of major cities such as Danzig or 
Breslau, and of concentration camps such as Auschwitz, were accompanied by 
death marches. German life in the East was coming to an end. [donhoff] 

Zhukov's offensive against Berlin was launched on 12 January 1945 from a 
range of some 400 miles. The Red Army cleared Poland when the Western allies 
were still well short of the Rhine. The fall of Budapest in mid-February 
permitted a two-pronged lunge which had Vienna as well as Berlin in its sights. 
In early March the Americans had a fortunate break, when German sappers 
failed to blow the last remaining bridge across the Rhine, at Remagen. Soon 
General Patton would come riding triumphantly out of this Western bridgehead 
even faster than Zhukov out of the East; his men would eventually meet up with 
the Soviets in the Torgau in Saxony on 23 April. The British, with Canadian and 
Polish support, had liberated the Netherlands, and were far advanced along the 
northern Plain. Berlin was cut off by a ring of Russian steel. From his bunker 
beneath the bomb-blasted debris, the Fiihrer watched the Reich's defences 
crumble. 

When the Big Three met again at Yalta in Crimea from 4 to 11 February 
1945, the end was already close. Regarding Germany, they agreed on the 
establishment of four separate Allied occupation zones, on the destruction of the 
Reich's military-industrial capacity, on the prosecution of war criminals, and on 
the need to guarantee Germans no more than 'minimum subsistence'. Regarding 
Poland, they agreed that there should be 'free and unfettered elections', and that 
a Provisional Government should draw its members both from Stalin's Lublin 
Committee and from the London Poles. On Japan, which worried the ailing 
Roosevelt most, they agreed that the USSR should enter the Pacific war two to 
three months after the end of hostilities in Europe. A secret protocol empowered 
the Soviets to reoccupy the Kurile Islands. These arrangements did not have the 
force of an international treaty; they were the private working guidelines of the 
Allied Powers, [keelhaul] 


DONHOFF 




Marion, Countess Donhoff was bom in 1909 at the family palace of 
Friedrichstein, twenty miles from Konigsberg in East Prussia. The seventh 
child of a numerous brood, she followed the timeless routine of the semi- 
feudal East European aristocracy, unaware that their time was running out. 

Friedrichstein in the 1900s still offered its residents all the beauties of 
nature and the benefits of privilege. Set amidst the lakes and forests and the 
sharp seasons of the East, it drew its children into a blissful round of horses, 
picnics, and libraries, of tutors, loving nannies, and distinguished guests. 
Marion's mother, once a lady-in-waiting to the Empress at Potsdam, ran the 
house with a taste for the rigid etiquette and social hierarchy of the Kaiser's 
court. She trained the servants to address her with 'Most humbly, good 
morning, Your Excellency'. Marion's father, Karl August, an easy-going 
globetrotter and sometime diplomat at the German embassies at St 
Petersburg and Washington, was a member of both the hereditary Prussian 
Senate and the elected German Reichstag. The style was one of public 
opulence, private austerity, and Lutheran piety. 

The Donhoffs, like many German noble families, had moved to the East 
in the Middle Ages. Their original home was at Dunehof on the Ruhr in 
Westphalia. Their second, also Dunehof. was set up in 1330 near Riga in 
Livonia, where they remained for eighteen generations. That senior Livonian 
branch of the family, usually known as Denhoff, became prominent Polish 
magnates-palatines, hetmans, starostas, and cardinals. The Prussian, 
Protestant Donhoffs were descended from the Livonian Magnus Ernst von 
Donhoff, sometime Polish ambassador to Saxony and Brandenburg, who 
settled near Konigsberg in 1620. His son, Friedrich, bought the main estates 
by the Pregd in 1666. His grandson, Otto Magnus, governor of Memel and 
Prussian ambassador at the Treaty of Utrecht, built the pile of Friedrichstein 
in 1709-14. 

Wars and disasters were taken in their stride on the Prussian frontier. In 
the Great Northern War, 40 per cent of East Prussia's population died of 
plague. The revolutionary wars saw the entailing of the estate in 1791, the 
arrival of the French in 1807, the emancipation of the serfs in 1810, and the 
arrival of Kutuzov in 1813. In the First World War, having escaped from the 
Russian advance of August 1914, it greeted its saviour, Field Marshal von 
Hindenburg, in person. 

At first the war of 1939 looked just like any other. Yet by the winter of 



1944-5 it was clear that some final and total nemesis was at hand. Unlike 
any of its predecessors, the advancing Soviet army was intent on eradicating 
the Germanity of East Prussia once and for all. With all the adult males of 
her family dead, either killed on the Eastern Front or executed after the 
bomb-plot against Hitler, Marion Donhoff had been left administering the 
estates of Friedrichstein and Quittainen alone. One night in January 1945 she 
mounted her horse, joined the flood of westbound refugees, and rode 1,000 
miles in two months, all the way to Westphalia. (She paused only once, to 
stay with Bismarck's daughter-in-law at Varzin in Pomerania.) The 600-year 
Eastern adventure of the Donhoffs had come full circle. Friedrichstein, 
deserted, was annexed to the RSFSR. 

The fate of Friedrichstein and of the Donhoffs was repeated hundreds of 
times over right across Europe. The destruction which the Bolsheviks meted 
out to Russia's own aristocracy in 1918-21 awaited the landed proprietors of 
every country which the Red Army entered, either in 1939-40 or in 1944-5. 
The old German families of Prussia, Bohemia, and the Baltic States were 
cast into the same abyss which engulfed the Polish families of Fithuania, 
Byelorussia, and Ukraine, and the Magyars of Slovakia and Croatia. Indeed, 
not just the aristocrats but entire populations of all classes were removed. 
The Soviet scourge destroyed not just privilege but centuries of culture. 1 

At least Marion Donhoff survived. After the war she worked as a 
journalist in Hamburg, becoming editor of Die Zeit in 1968 and its publisher 
in 1973. When she wrote her memoirs, she mused on the futility of revenge: 

'I also do not believe that hating those who have taken over one's homeland 
... necessarily demonstrates love for the homeland. When I remember the 
woods and lakes of East Pmssia, its wide meadows and old shaded avenues, 
I am convinced that they are still as incomparably lovely as they were when 
they were my home. Perhaps the highest form of love is loving without 
possessing.' 2 


Just as doctors will debate the exact moment of human death, in heart, brain, 
lungs, or limbs, so it is with bodies politic. In the case of the Third Reich, the 
siege of Berlin ensured suffocation; the suicide of the Fiihrer on 30 April 




prevented all chance of recovery; the general surrender of 8/9 May marked the 
last twitch. The Nuremberg Tribunal of 1946 may be likened to the coroner's 
court. 

The siege of Berlin, as foreseen at Yalta, was left to the Soviet Army. The 
terminal phase lasted for three weeks from 20 April. Zhukov poured in reserves 
without counting the cost; he was probably to lose more men in this one 
operation than the US army lost in the whole of the war. As the noose tightened, 
various Nazi officials slipped out. Hitler's deputy, Martin Bormann, left-never 
to be seen again. One of the last planes to take off disappeared with a cargo of 
Nazi archives. Berlin sold itself dearly: it was the Warsaw Rising in reverse. 
Eventually, Soviet soldiers hung the Red flag atop the shattered Reichstag. 

In his bunker at the junction of the Wilhelmstrasse and Unter den Linden, the 
Fiihrer lost all contact with outside events. Tf the war is to be lost,' he had 
remarked, The nation will also perish.'- His orders were transmitted into an 
unresponsive vacuum. On 29 April he went through a form of marriage with Eva 
Braun, who had declined the offer of escape. On the 30th the newly-weds died in 
a poison and pistol-shot suicide pact. They thereby avoided the fate of Mussolini 
and his mistress, who the previous day had been strung up by the feet in Milan. 
When the Hitlers died, the Russians were 200 yards away. The Fiihrer left orders 
for the burning of the bodies in a petrol pit, and a brief will and testament: 

It is untrue that I, or anyone in Germany, wanted the war in 1939. It was desired and instigated solely by 
those international statesmen who were either of Jewish descent or who worked for Jewish interests ... I die 
with a happy heart, aware of the immeasurable deeds of our soldiers at the front... Above all, I charge the 
leaders of the nation ... to scmpulous observation of the laws of race, and to merciless opposition to the 
universal poisoner of all peoples, international Jewry.- 

The last remains of the Fiihrer and his wife were buried by the KGB in east 
Germany, and eventually incinerated by them in 1970. Two fragments of a skull 
said to be Hitler's were produced from the ex-Soviet archives in 1993. 

'Victory in Europe', or VE Day, followed in the second week of May. For the 
Nazis it meant annihilation, the vengeance of their gods; for the German nation it 
spelled total defeat. General Montgomery accepted the submission of a German 
delegation in his tent on the Liineburg Heath; General Eisenhower accepted the 
formal capitulation at his base near Reims; Marshal Zhukov did the same at his 
HQ at Karlshorst. The moment of Germany's unconditional surrender was fixed 
for midnight on the 8th (GMT). This was 5 a.m. on the 9th (Moscow Time). 


As always, the declaration of peace did not quite match the reality. The Allied 
Powers were still at war in the Pacific. In the desert of New Mexico, the 
scientists were still working feverishly for the first atomic test. In Europe, 
pockets of fighting continued. A German army cornered in Prague was finished 
off by elements of Vlasov's RLA, who had vainly changed sides in the hope of a 
reprieve. Pockets of local resistance against the Soviet takeover continued in 
Eastern Europe and the western USSR until the 1950s. 


KEELHAUL 

In February 1945, Major Denis Hills, an officer of the British Eighth Army I 
in Italy, was given command of a POW camp at Taranto containing 8,000 
men of the 162 Turkoman Infantry Division, classified as 'repatriates'. His 
charges had been conscripted into the Red Army, been captured on the 
Eastern Front by the Germans, and had endured starvation and cannibalism 
under arrest before volunteering for service with the Wehrmacht. Having 
sailed with them to Odessa, whither they were transported under the terms of 
the Yalta Agreement, he had no doubts that all such Soviet repatriates were 
being sent home to be killed. 1 

In subsequent assignments, Hills repeatedly faced the age-old dilemma 
of a soldier whose conscience did not match his order. In the case of the SS 
Fede, which was trying to leave La Spezia for Palestine with an illegal 
shipload of Jewish emigrants, he advised his superiors that regulations 
should be waived to let them sail-which they did. 'I had wished to 
extinguish a small glow of hatred before it grew into a flame.' 2 

During Operation Keelhaul (1946-7), Hills was given 498 ex-Soviet 
prisoners for screening in a camp at Riccione. His orders were to repatriate 
to the USSR (1) all persons captured in German uniforms, (2) all former Red 
Army soldiers, and (3) all persons who had aided the enemy. By inventing 
spurious categories such as 'paramilitaries' and by privately urging people to 
flee, he whittled down the number of repatriates to 180. When they left, the 
Russian leader of the group told him: 'So you are sending us to our deaths 
... Democracy has failed us.' 'You are the sacrifice', Hills replied; 'the 
others will now be safe.' 3 




In the case of Ukrainians from the Waffen-SS Galicia Division held at 
Rimini, Major Hills was one of several British officers who personally 
rebuffed the demands of the Soviet Repatriation Commission. When the 
Division was reprieved, he was sent a letter from the division's CO, thanking 
him 'for your highly humane work ... defending the principles in the name 
of which the Second World War has been started'. 4 According to 
international law, the Galicians were Polish, not Soviet citizens. 

Hills admitted that he 'bent the rules'. 5 Shortly afterwards, he was court- 
martialled and demoted on a charge of unseemly conduct, having been 
caught doing cartwheels and handsprings at dawn in the city square of 
Trieste. 

The Allied policy of forcibly repatriating large numbers of men, women, and 
children for killing by Stalin and Tito has been called a war crime. In the 
Drau Valley in Austria, where in June 1945 British troops used violence to 
round up the so-called Cossack Brigade and their dependants, it provoked 
mass suicides. But it was well hidden until a report written by Major Hills 
came to light in the USA in 1973, and the opening of British archives. 
Solzhenitsyn called it 'The Last Secret'. It only reached the wider public 
through books published thirty and forty years after the event. 6 

More recently, an unusual libel trial in London awarded £1.5 million 
damages against Count Nikolai Tolstoy, author of The Minister and the 
Massacres, who had written of an official British conspiracy and cover-up. 
The plaintiff was not the minister accused of ordering the handover of the 
Cossacks, but a British officer who, faced with the same problem as Hills, 
had pursued a different policy. He did not receive a penny of his award, as 
the defendants fought on in the European courts. 7 

Individual responsibility is always hard to prove. But the moral principle is 
unequivocal. If 'obeying orders' could be no defence for Adolf Eichmann, it 
can be no defence for Allied officers. 


Six weeks later, at Potsdam, from 17 July to 2 August, the Big Three met for 
the last time. Of the wartime leaders Stalin alone survived, suspicious that the 




capitalist powers might turn against him. Contrary to all predictions, Churchill 
was defeated in Britain's post-war election, and replaced in the middle of the 
conference by the socialist Clement Attlee. Roosevelt had died before the fall of 
Germany; he was succeeded by his no-nonsense Vice-President, Harry Truman. 
Differences among them were so great that the original idea of organizing a 
Peace Conference was shelved. When Truman arranged for a melodramatic 
announcement of the successful American A-bomb test, Stalin did not even 
blink. 

So Potsdam stuck to practical matters. Germany was to be given an 
Interallied Council to co-ordinate the administration of its four occupation zones. 
Austria was to be restored to its independence. France was to be given back 
Alsace-Lorraine, and Czechoslovakia the Sudetenland. Poland was to be given a 
frontier on the Oder-Neisse line, whether the Poles wanted it or not. All Germans 
living east of the new frontiers were to be expelled. All the Nazi leaders who had 
fallen into the Allied net were to stand trial before an International War Crimes 
Tribunal. Beyond that, the Allies could agree on little; and they did not try. 

By which time, the processes of reconstruction and forgetting were in full 
swing: 

After every war 
someone has to clear up. 

For things won't find their right place 
on their own. 

Someone has to heave 
the rubble to the roadsides 
so the carts piled high with corpses 
can pass by. 

Photogenic it certainly isn't; 
and it takes years. 

All the cameras have gone off 
to other wars. 

Those who knew 

what this was all about 

must make way for those 

who know little, or less than a little, 

or simply nothing.- 


Friday, 19 October 1945, Nuremberg.- The city was occupied by the US 
Army. An American colonel had taken command of the city prison which stood 
immediately behind the Palace of Justice on the Fiirtherstrasse. Of the 24 named 
defendants in the 'Trial of German Major War Criminals', 21 were locked in 
their cells. It was the day when they were due to be served with their 
indictments. 

The task of serving the indictments had fallen to a young British major, a 
former prisoner of war, who spoke fluent German. As he entered the cell-block 
just before 2 p.m. he saw three tiers of cells, each with a small window grille in 
the door. A guard was lolling at every door, peering through the grille. On the 
upper floors the open balconies were covered with wire netting. The twenty- 
second defendant had recently committed suicide. The event was to be witnessed 
by a dozen men. The major was shown into the block by the commandant of the 
prison and by a master-sergeant who carried the keys. Behind them walked the 
General Secretary of the International Military Tribunal with his interpreter, two 
American soldiers carrying documents, an officer of the US security staff, the 
prison psychologist, notebook in hand, and the prison's Lutheran chaplain. A 
handful of 'snowdrops'-American military policemen in their characteristic 
white helmets-brought up the rear. 

The indictments, freshly translated from English into German, were bulky 
documents. The cover-page read: 'The United States of America, the French 
Republic, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the 
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics against ...', followed by a column of 24 
names, headed by that of Goering. There were four counts-conspiracy in 
common, crimes against peace, war crimes, crimes against humanity. Each of the 
accused was to receive two copies, which outlined both the general charges and 
the particular counts on which he was accused. Anglo-American practice 
required that the indictments be served in person. 

The young major, though a law graduate, had no particular experience of 
such duties. When he saw the wire netting his thoughts turned to one of his 
wartime companions, a Belgian airman captured by the Gestapo, who had leapt 
to his death from exactly such a balcony in the prison at Suresnes. Though he 
had been working for the Tribunal for several months, the major had only just 
arrived in Nuremberg, and he had never met any of the prisoners face to face: 



Map 27. 

Post-War Germany, after 1945 


'I looked towards the high window at the far end of the prison. The spiral stairs to the upper rows of cells 
were in silhouette against the bright autumn sun. There was that eternal silence, only the menacing sound of 
keys... 

The silence continued until we reached a cell near the end of the row. The guard on duty saluted. I 
noticed that he was armed with a revolver and a blackjack ... As the cell was unlocked, I braced myself to 
meet [the prisoner, who] rose unsteadily to his feet.... 

I was surprised to find my voice. 

'Hermann Wilhelm Goering?' 

'Jawohl. ' 

'I am Major Neave, the officer appointed by the International Military Tribunal to serve upon you a 
copy of the indictment in which you are named as a defendant. 5 

Goering's expression changed to a scowl, the look of a stage gangster, as the words were interpreted. I 






























handed him a copy of the indictment which he took in silence. He listened as I said, 'I am also asked to 
explain to you Article 16 of the Charter of the Tribunal.' 

A copy in German was handed to him. 

'If you will look at paragraph (c). You have the right to conduct your own defence before the tribunal, 
or to have the assistance of counsel.' 

My words were correct and precise. Goering looked serious and depressed as I paused. 

'So it has come,' he said... 

'You can have counsel of your own choice, or the tribunal can appoint one for you. ' 

It was evident that Goering did not understand ... Then he said, 'I do not know any lawyers. I have 
nothing to do with them.'... 

'I think that you would be well advised to be represented by someone.'... 

He shrugged his shoulders. 

'It all seems pretty hopeless to me. I must read this indictment very carefully, but I do not see how it 
can have any basis in law.'... 

Some hours after I left Goering's cell, Dr. Gilbert, the prison psychologist, asked him to autograph a 
copy of the indictment. Goering wrote, 'The victor will always be the judge and the vanquished the 
accused.'- 


In this way, the fundamental dilemma of the Nuremberg Trials found expression 
even before the trials began. 

Europe in the autumn of 1945 was functioning at the lowest level of subsistence. 
The victorious Allies had divided a devastated Germany into four zones of 
occupation, and were struggling to maintain a united front. The Western 
countries liberated by the Anglo-Americans-France, Italy, Belgium, the 
Netherlands-were picking up the strands of their pre-war existence. The 
Eastern countries liberated by the Soviets were finding that liberation was joined 
to a new form of subjugation. Great Britain, the only combatant country to have 
avoided occupation, had recently chosen a socialist government which was 
realizing that victory was no safeguard against a marked decline in status. There 
was no single state in Europe, like the USA, which was both victorious and 
unscathed. A handful of neutrals, from Spain to Sweden, were free to exercise a 
degree of real independence. 

Several countries had already staged trials to punish wartime acts that were 
now considered criminal. In Oslo, Quisling was tried and executed in 
September: in Paris, Laval suffered the extreme penalty on 9 October. In 
Moscow, the trial of Polish underground leaders had taken place in June; public 
opinion in the West was not fully aware that the defendants in this case were 
neither fascists nor collaborators, but heroic allies whose only crime had been to 


fight for their country's independence. Western governments had preferred to 
press privately for lenient sentences rather than protest publicly. 

Nurnberg (Nuremberg), one of Germany's most ancient and most German 
cities, had been reduced to a sea of rubble, having been subjected to eleven mass 
bombing raids. Then, when two SS divisions decided to make it the scene of 
their last stand, it had been mercilessly shelled into submission by American 
heavy artillery. Home of the medieval Meistersingers and of Tannhauser, of 
Albrecht Diirer and of Veit Stoss, it had been chosen in the previous century as 
the home of the German Museum, a magnificent collection of German national 
art and history. In the 1930s it had been chosen as the venue for Hitler's most 
dramatic Nazi rallies. It had now been chosen for the Trials partly for its 
symbolic value, partly because its imposing Palace of Justice had miraculously 
survived the bombing. To hold the trials in Nuremberg was to emphasize the 
Allied view that the root of Germany's evil lay not in Prussian militarism (as was 
the view in 1918) but in the very nature of the Germans' national identity. The 
setting of the trial seemed designed to teach a history lesson far deeper than the 
offences of the individual defendants. 

Nuremberg's special contribution to the Trials, however, was to be found in 
the person of defendant no. 8, Julius Streicher (b. 1885), who had ruled the city 
as Nazi Gauleiter from 1933 to 1940. He was serving his second time in the cells 
behind the Palace of Justice, having once been arrested for molesting a boy 
prisoner during one of his official visits. He was a blatant sexual pervert, as his 
jailers were able to observe, and a lifelong Jew-baiter whose speciality lay in 
linking sex with anti-semitism. In his crusade against 'race pollution' he had 
invented a spurious biochemical theory, whereby the albumen of Jewish semen 
was capable of permanently 'infecting' any woman with whom it came into 
contact. As the editor of Der Sturmer he waged a constant campaign to protect 
German maidens from Jewish seducers-a cause which he later gave pseudo¬ 
scientific cover in the journal Deutsche Volksgesundheit aus Blut und Boden. He 
was the main instigator of the Nuremberg Laws which forbade all sexual 
intercourse in Germany between Jews and non-Jews. In 1938, on Kristallnacht, 
he had made a speech urging the rioters to follow the glorious example of the 
medieval pogroms that had been perpetrated in the city. As an early recruit to the 
NSDAP, he was one of the few Nazi leaders to address the Fiihrer as du. But he 
overstepped the mark when he publicly asserted that Goring's daughter had been 
conceived by artificial insemination. The infuriated Reichsmarschall had 
instigated a commission of inquiry that uncovered such gross corruption that 



Hitler himself could not save his Gauleiter from instant retirement. 

The Allied decision to stage a war crimes trial had not been lightly reached. 
Churchill had been against it, as had Henry Morgenthau, the Secretary of the US 
Treasury. In the absence of legal precedents, they argued that it would be better 
to shoot the Nazi leaders by summary execution. Their opinion was overruled: 
the Allied governments had committed themselves to the principle of war crimes 
trials by the Declaration of St James (January 1942) and the Moscow 
Declaration (November 1943); and the established policy had too much support 
to be discarded. Of the Big Three, Roosevelt and Stalin were both in favour. As a 
result, the trial had to take place. They were necessary both as 'a sincere but 
naive attempt to apply the rule of law'- and to demonstrate the limitless power 
of the victors. Stalin had used show trials as an instrument of his political victory 
inside the Soviet Union; and there is no reason to think that he would have 
missed the opportunity for a similar show of strength after his great international 
victory. Stalin, after all, was the chief beneficiary, since in any equitable 
settlement he might easily have found himself in the dock. 

The International Military Tribunal was created in consequence of the 
Potsdam Agreements. Its Charter was published on 8 August 1945, two days 
after the Hiroshima bombing. The Nuremberg Trials were planned as the 
European counterpart to similar trials against Japanese leaders that were due to 
take place in Tokyo. 

Once the indictments were served, the opening of the Nuremberg Trials was set 
for 20 November 1945. From then, the Trials proceeded through 403 open 
sessions in the main courtroom of the Palace of Justice until the final sentences 
of the judgment were read more than ten months later, on 1 October 1946. The 
four Allied judges, under their Chairman, Sir Geoffrey Lawrence QC, sat on one 
side with their deputies. The 21 defendants present, who all pleaded not guilty, 
filled the benches of the dock opposite, under strict military guard. The four 
Allied prosecutors-an American, a Briton, a Frenchman, and a Soviet-shared 
the middle ground with their deputies and assistants, with the crowd of 
defending German counsel, and with a mass of clerks, translators, and 
interpreters. A raised public gallery had been built in one lateral wing of the 
courtroom. The proceedings were conducted and recorded in English, German, 
French, and Russian. At any one time, therefore, the majority of participants 
would be listening to simultaneous translations on headphones. 


In addition to those present, Martin Bormann, Hitler's deputy, was tried in 
absentia, as were eight defendant organizations charged with collective 
criminality: the SS, the SD, the SA, and the Gestapo: the 'leadership corps of the 
NSDAP', the Reich Cabinet, the General Staff, and the High Command of the 
German Armed Forces. Proceedings against Gustav Krupp, the industrialist, 
were dropped on account of the defendant's incapacity. In all, the prosecution 
produced over 4,000 documents, 1,809 affidavits, and 33 live witnesses. They 
also showed films, and introduced a number of grisly exhibits including 'human 
lampshades' and the heads of men mounted on wooded stands like those of 
stags. The defence produced 143 witnesses, together with hundreds of thousands 
of affidavits. The corpus of the Trials, published in 1946, ran to 43 volumes.- 

The opening speeches of the prosecution made lofty appeals to the highest 
moral principles, whilst betraying some sensitivity to the legal uncertainties. 
Justice Robert H. Jackson admitted that the Tribunal was 'novel and 
experimental'. Sir Hartley Shawcross appealed to the 'rule of law', M. de 
Menthon to 'the conscience of the peoples'. General Rudenko spoke of'the 
sacred memory of millions of victims of the fascist terror'... and 'the conscience 
of all freedom-loving peoples'. Jackson probably made the best case by arguing 
from the inadmissibility of inaction. 'Civilisation asks whether law is so laggard 
as to be utterly helpless to deal with crimes of this magnitude . 

Within their limited terms of reference, the Trials were conducted with great 
decorum and circumspection. Lord Justice Lawrence set an example to the 
judges by extending every courtesy to the defence, and by acidly reprimanding 
the prosecution where necessary. The only time when the proceedings became 
unruly was when Jackson lost control of Goring during cross-examination. 
Blanket verdicts were never likely, acquittals always possible. 

The strongest testimony was presented on the counts of war crimes and 
crimes against humanity. Here the evidence against the Nazi party men was 
damning, especially when derived from their own records. The death-camps of 
the Final Solution, the unspeakable horrors of pseudo-medical experiments, 
mass atrocities of unprecedented proportions were comprehensively documented 
in a manner leaving little margin for error. The weakest testimony was offered on 
the counts of common conspiracy, and on points where it was easy for the 
defence to plead normal practice of sovereign states. It was hard to prove that 
Hitler's 'secret meetings' with his colleagues constituted evil intent, or that 
rearmament was in itself inspired by aggressive motives. Direct comparisons 


with Allied conduct, however, were not permitted. The defence could not raise 
the failings of the Versailles settlement or of the Allied bombing offensive, nor 
the subject of Soviet atrocities. 'We are here to judge major war criminals,' Lord 
Justice Lawrence insisted, 'not to try the prosecuting powers.' Attempts to 
discuss conditions in Allied internment camps or the forcible expulsion of 
Germans, which was in progress at the time, were cut short. 'The Defence is 
attempting to introduce breaches of International law by the Allies,' reported The 
Times on 8 May 1946, 'but [the prosecutor] made the point that if this were 
accepted, he would be obliged to bring evidence of rebuttal, which would 
needlessly prolong the trial.'- 

The subject of the Katyn massacres was initially raised by the Soviet 
prosecutor. When the defence lawyers were able to show that many of the 
prosecutor's facts were false, the Soviet team promptly dropped the accusations. 
[katyki] 

Eyewitnesses to the Trials recalled many moments of drama and irony. There 
was the symbolic scene of the wild-eyed Hess sitting in the dock reading 
Grimms' Fairy Tales. Another minor sensation occurred in November when the 
Soviet prosecution team was joined unannounced by Andrei Vyshinsky, the chief 
Soviet delegate to the United Nations, best remembered as Stalin's chief 
prosecutor in the Purge trials of the 1930s. Many observers commented on the 
eerie contrast between the fate-laden climate of the courtroom and the merry 
flow of pink gins in the bar of the Grand Hotel next door. 

The American security staff provided two psychiatrists and one psychologist 
for the defendants' welfare. As part of his duties, the psychologist prepared tests 
for the defendants' IQ ratings: 

Schacht, 143; Seyss-Inquart, 140; Goring, 138; Donitz, 138; von Papen, 134; 
Raeder, 134; Frank, 130; Fritzsche, 130; von Schirach, 130; Ribbentrop, 129; 
Keitel, 129; Speer, 128; Jodi, 127; Rosenberg, 127; von Neurath, 125; Funk, 
124; Frick, 124; Hess, 120; Sauckel, 118; Kaltenbrunner, 113; Streicher, 106.- 

The sentences, when they came, caused some surprise. Schacht, the banker, 
Fritzsche, the propagandist, and von Papen, the sometime Vice-Chancellor, were 
acquitted on all counts. So, too, were the Reich Cabinet, the General Staff, and 
the High Command. Donitz, von Neurath, von Schirach, Speer, and Hess 
received prison sentences varying from 10 years to life. Goring was branded 'the 
leading war aggressor' and convicted on all four counts. He and ten others were 


sentenced to death by the rope. The Soviet prosecutor entered a dissenting 
opinion on all the acquittals and prison sentences. Each of the prisoners reacted 
in his own way to the prospect of hanging. Jodi said bitterly 'That, I didn't 
deserve.' Ribbentrop said, 'I won't be able to write my beautiful memoirs.' Hans 
Frank said, 'I deserved it and expected it.'- When the psychologist asked Hess 
what sentence he had been given, Hess replied 'I've no idea. Probably the death 
penalty. I didn't listen.'- Goring cheated the hangman by killing himself with a 
cyanide pellet concealed in a dental crown. 

Ten executions were carried out in the gymnasium of the prison block on 16 
October 1946. Most of the condemned died with patriotic words on their lips. 
Frank shouted, 'Deutschland iiber alles'. Streicher said, 'Heil Hitler. Purim 1946. 
The Bolsheviks will hang you all,' then commended himself to his wife. Rumour 
held that the US army executioner botched his job, causing lingering deaths, and 
that the bodies were cremated at Dachau. The five remaining convicts were 
transported to Spandau Jail in Berlin, where the four-power administration was 
to continue until the strange death of Hess in 1987. 

A wide range of criticisms was levelled against the trials from the outset. On the 
purely political front, fears were expressed that the defendants would be turned 
into martyrs. This did not happen, either in Germany or elsewhere. The head of 
repugnance built up by the Trials' revelations was large enough to offset any 
counter-currents of sympathy. If there was a general consensus, it held that the 
crimes of the Nazis outweighed any element of rough justice that was meted to 
individuals. Many lawyers, however, were gravely worried by the ex post facto 
nature of the indictments. Nulla poena sine lege. Dissenting voices did not 
accept Jackson's contention that the Tribunal was contributing to 'the growth of 
international law\- They were also scandalized by the court's lack of 
independence. For the Allied Powers to supply both the judges and the 
prosecutors on terms and in an arena dictated by themselves made for bad legal 
practice, and for poor publicity. 'While clothed with forms of justice,' objected 
Senator Robert Taft, '[the trials] were in fact an instrument of government 
policy, determined months before at Yalta and Teheran.'- A widespread 
opinion, especially among the Allied military, held that honourable German 
officers like Admiral Donitz should not have been put in the same dock as active 
Nazis like Goring or Streicher. When Donitz was released in 1956, several 
hundred distinguished Allied veterans, headed by US Admiral Nimitz, 


contributed to a volume of regrets.- 

To those who could resist the emotions of the times, it was scandalous that 
the Western press and government agencies often encouraged the notion of 
collective guilt. All the defendants were routinely labelled as 'criminals' long 
before the verdicts were pronounced. Most seriously of all, the fact that the 
Nuremberg trials were limited to offences committed by the defeated enemy 
erected an insuperable obstruction to any general and impartial investigation into 
war crimes or crimes against humanity. It created the lasting impression in public 
opinion that such crimes could not by definition be committed by agents of the 
Allied Powers. 

For historians, the Nuremberg Trials are of interest both as a historical event 
in their own right and as an exercise in examining the past through legal 
methods. Their advocates were convinced that 'we discovered the truth'.- 
Their critics maintain that less than half the truth was discovered. To be precise, 
the Nuremberg Trials confirmed beyond all reasonable doubt the reality of Nazi 
crimes. They also documented the role played by Germany in the origins and 
conduct of the Second World War, not always in the light demanded by the 
prosecutors. At the same time, by isolating the German factor from all others, 
they were bound to construct a biased and, in the last resort, an untenable 
analysis. Equally, by knowing omissions, they encouraged the erroneous view 
that there was little more to discover. The historical material which was 
marshalled in the indictments, and then in the preamble to the final judgment, 
was intended for 'throwing light on matters of interest to the International 
Military Tribunal'. Yet it was so blatantly selective that even the most fervent 
opponents of Nazism could despair. To mention the Nazi-Soviet pact, for 
example, but only in the category of treaties violated by the German Reich, was 
grossly misleading. 'The published indictment', wrote a leading historian on the 
day that the document was served in the cells, 'reads like history written by non¬ 
historians.'- 

The Nuremberg Trials were the source both of huge quantities of valid 
historical information and of manifest historical distortions. Bolstered by the 
public attitudes which they encouraged in the West, and by the Soviet 
censorship, which used the findings as gospel, they became the bastion of a 
particular 'Allied Scheme of History' that would prevail for fifty years (see 
Introduction). Not until Solzhenitsyn in the 1960s, and Glasnost' in the 1980s, 
did public opinion begin to realize that the Nuremberg prosecutors were masters 


no less of concealment than of unmasking. Andrei Vyshinsky demonstrated the 
fact when, in a rare moment of honesty, he proposed a toast at a Nuremberg 
reception: 'Death to the Defendants!'.- As usual, his Western partners did not 
understand Russian. They drank the toast without hesitation, then asked what it 
meant afterwards.

DIVISA ET INDIVISA 
Europe Divided and Undivided, 1945-1991 


There is a strong sense of futility about Europe in the second half of the 
twentieth century. The vast sacrifices of the Second World War did not generate 
security: the Continent was soon divided into rival political and military blocs 
whose energies were squandered for nearly fifty years. Immense resources were 
poured into unproductive tasks, especially in the East; there were few countries 
who could maintain a neutral stance; and the construction of European unity was 
repeatedly postponed. 

The mood of futility was well caught in the post-war circle of Jean-Paul 
Sartre and the philosophers of existentialism. It faded soon enough in most 
Western countries, but surfaced again with the peace movement and the anti¬ 
nuclear protesters of later decades. In Eastern Europe it belied the optimism of 
official propaganda, and remained a dominant note in people's inner lives until 
the 'Refolution' (revolution by reform) of 1989-91. 

Fortunately, for those who wished to heal the wounds, the division of Europe 
helped to stimulate the strong European movement which had been planted 
before the war, and which now grew up in the West. First as a moral campaign 
for reforming international relations, and later in the realm of economic 
cooperation, it fostered a new sense of community. In the Council of Europe 
(from 1949) and in the EEC and its associated bodies (from 1956), it founded a 
complex of institutions, which were designed to expand as more and more 








European countries were welcomed into the fold. Even so, the alternative 
prospect of an all-European communist camp was not effaced for many decades. 

In the event, the West proved itself to be immeasurably more dynamic than 
the East. With the assistance of the USA, Western Europe rapidly emerged from 
the post-war ruins and set a course for unrivalled prosperity. Inspired by the 
example of West Germany's Wirtschaftswunder, the original members of the 
European Economic Community had little difficulty in publicizing the benefits 
of their cause. Membership doubled from six in 1956 to twelve in 1983, with 
many applications pending. Whilst the Kremlin coped ever more ineptly with its 
muscle-bound empire, the rapid process of decolonization in Asia and Africa 
liberated West Europe's imperial powers for a new future in an integrated 
Europe. Under the leadership of NATO, West Europe's defences held firm 
against a Soviet threat that grew ever less credible. By the late 1980s the 
European movement seemed to be moving towards maturity at the very time that 
Soviet communism was climbing onto its death-bed. 

Despite the divisions, however, the concept of Europe was no less alive in 
the East than in the West. Soviet tyranny was very effective in promoting the 
European ideal by default. Citizens of the former Soviet bloc were mightily 
impressed by Western Europe's food mountains; but there is every reason to 
believe that their aspirations to rejoin 'Europe' had a spiritual as well as a 
material dimension. 'Europe has two lungs,' declared a Slavonic Pope; 'it will 
never breathe easily until it uses both of them.'- 

Europe's wasted years fall neatly into three periods. They began in the 
immediate post-war era (1945-8), when Allied unity was lost. They continued 
through four decades of the Cold War (1948-89); and they drew to a close with 
the astonishing reign in Moscow of Mikhail Gorbachev (1985-91). Overall, they 
may be said to have begun on VE Day, 9 May 1945, and to have ended with the 
final disband-ment of the Soviet Union in December 1991. By that time, almost 
all of Europe's peoples were free to determine their own destiny. 

" " • 


The End of the Grand Alliance, 1945-1948 

The division of Europe was implicit in the state of affairs at war's end. As Stalin 




correctly predicted, the social and political systems of East and West were 
destined to follow the positions of the occupying armies. Yet the division of 
Europe did not crystallize immediately. At first the victorious Allies were 
preoccupied with the immediate problems of refugees, resettlement, and 
reparations; and they were obliged to co-operate in the joint administration of 
Germany and Austria. Stalin acted cautiously, following different policies in 
different capitals. The Americans, too, were very slow to reveal their intentions. 

Unlike 1918, there were no urgent demands for a general Peace Conference. 
There was no German government with whom a new Treaty might be signed; 
and Stalin in particular had no wish to renegotiate the massive gains which he 
had already secured. In consequence, the only Peace Conference to be held was 
the one which met at Paris in July-October 1946 to settle the affairs of five lesser 
defeated states-Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland. Proceedings 
were fixed by the Allied Council of Foreign Ministers, who virtually dictated the 
terms of the settlement. All the defeated states were obliged to cede territory. 
Italy lost the whole of her African empire, but not South Tyrol. All had to pay 
enormous indemnities, totalling $1,250 million, mainly to the USSR and to 
Yugoslavia. In the teeth of Soviet opposition, the Conference insisted on 
establishing the Danube as an international waterway, and Trieste as a free port 
under the United Nations. 

Trieste, the sole European territory to be openly disputed after the Second 
World War, remained in a high state of tension for seven years. Zone A, 
including the port and city, was secured by British troops; Zone B, to the east, 
was held by the Yugoslavs. This partition was finally accepted by Italo-Yugoslav 
agreement in October 1954. (See Appendix III, p. 1313.) 

Post-war Europe was faced with tidal waves of refugees. Both the Nazis and 
the Soviets had resorted to mass deportations and slave labour. Many survivors 
were now set free. There were 9 million such displaced persons (DPs) in 
Germany alone. They lived in primitive, overcrowded camps, often in barracks 
recently vacated by prisoners of war. The largest numbers came from countries 
recently occupied by the Red Army, to which, fearing retribution, they 
steadfastly refused to return. They were administered by UNRRA (the UN 
Refugee Relief Administration) and slowly dispersed, first as European 
Voluntary Workers to various industrial centres in Western Europe and later by 
emigration schemes to Canada, USA, Australia, and South America. The last 
emigrants did not leave until 1951-2. 



Military personnel were also stranded in huge numbers. The Western Powers 
had difficulty making provision even for units that had fought on the Allied side. 
General Anders's Polish army, for example, which had fought its way into 
northern Italy, contained several hundred thousands of men, and dependants, 
whose homes had been seized by the USSR. In 1946 they had all to be brought 
to Britain, where they were added to the Polish Resettlement Corps (PKRP) for 
retraining and assimilation.- Ironically enough, they were joined in Britain by 
ex-members of the Waffen SS Galizien, who had also found their way to Italy 
and who, as citizens of pre-war Poland, were not handed over to the mercies of 
the Soviet authorities. Most ex-Wehrmacht personnel were not so lucky. German 
prisoners of war captured by the Soviets were transported to the Gulag, where 
they shared the fate of ex-Soviet prisoners of war from Germany. (The remnants 
were repatriated in 1956.) 

The Western Allies were aware of communist barbarities towards people 
returning from abroad. But they generally held to a policy of forcible expulsion 
for all persons, both civilian and military, whose return was demanded by Stalin. 
The first transports of ex-slave labourers captured by the British Army in 
Normandy sailed in secret from Liverpool to Murmansk in October 1944. 
Serious resistance was provoked in Austria in the Spring of 1945 when many 
Soviet citizens chose mass suicide before repatriation. Hundreds of thousands, 
notably the Cossack Brigade and large numbers of Croats, were handed over to 
almost certain death before the practice was stopped.- [keelhaul] Not that the 
Anglo-Americans could necessarily boast about the treatment of POWs in their 
own charge. One study of American policy in 1945-6 has claimed that German 
prisoners held in western Europe were administratively reclassified in order to 
bypass the Geneva Convention, and that a significant proportion may have died 
from neglect.- 

The population exchanges envisaged at Potsdam took effect from the autumn 
of 1945. At least 9 million German expellees were driven from their homes in 
Czechoslovakia and Poland. Defenceless refugees became the prey of local 
revenge. The Communist security services used former Nazi camps as collection 
centres. Maltreatment was routine. The death toll was counted in tens of 
thousands. Miserably overcrowded transports were sent straight through to the 
British and American zones of Germany. The resultant Vertriebene verbande or 
provincial 'associations of expellees' were to become a potent anti-communist 
force in post-war politics. Their successful absorption was the first of West 


Germany's many miracles.- 

Compensatory population movements took place further East. The empty 
city of Konigsberg, renamed Kaliningrad, was repopulated by the Soviet military 
as an enclave of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Some 2-3 
million Poles were allowed to migrate westwards from provinces annexed by the 
USSR. The empty city of Breslau, for example, renamed Wroclaw, was largely 
taken over by Poles driven out of the city of Lwow, who arrived complete with 
their university, their mayor and corporation, and their national museum. Both in 
Poland and in Czechoslovakia, the former German territories provided a ready 
source of housing and employment for the poorest internal migrants. 

Given the fiasco after the First World War, the Western Powers decided not 
to press Germany for punitive reparations. The Soviets, in contrast, set out to 
extract the maximum. The official Soviet demand stood at $20 billion. But they 
did not wait for inter-Allied negotiations to fail: from the earliest days of 
occupation, Soviet reparation squads set about dismantling and removing 
industrial plant, railway lines, power stations, livestock, and rolling stock. The 
Soviet looters, private and collective, drew no distinction between Germany and 
lands designated for administration by Poland or Czechoslovakia. 

Across Europe, people wanted to settle accounts with wartime collaborators. 
In some cases, it was undertaken by legal process. Pierre Eaval, Vidkun 
Quisling, William Joyce (Lord Haw-Haw), and Father Tiso were among those 
sentenced and executed. The aged Marshal Petain, though sentenced to death, 
lived out his remaining years on the lie d'Yeu. Proceedings were most thorough 
in the Netherlands, where some 200,000 suspected collaborators were detained, 
and in Belgium, where, of 634,000 detained, 57,000 were sentenced. This 
compares with 9,000 trials and 35 death sentences in Austria. Often enough, 
though, the populace took matters into their own hands. In Italy, thousands of 
fascists were simply lynched or shot by partisans. In France, in a wild wave of 
retribution, at leaast 10,000 were killed, often on the flimsiest of accusations. In 
West Germany, once the Nuremberg trials of major war criminals were over (see 
pp. 1048-54), denazification proceeded slowly; criminal trials began in the late 
1950s. Sporadic trials of SS officers, employers of slave labour, and 
concentration camp personnel continued through the 1960s. But most of the big 
fish had swum off: 9 million ex-Nazis were too many to deal with. 

In Eastern Europe, the Communists used the purge of collaborators as a 
pretext for eliminating their own opponents. A few prominent Nazis and 


collaborators were made an example of: Hoess, the Commandant of Auschwitz, 
was tried and hanged in Poland in 1946. On the other hand, many of the rank and 
file were able to survive if they agreed to change sides. Boleslaw Piasecki, head 
of the Polish fascist Falanga, for example, emerged from a Soviet jail in 1945 as 
head of the communist-sponsored pseudo-Catholic organization PAX. 
Meanwhile the vast majority of East European politicals who were consigned in 
droves to the Soviet Gulag or to other communist prisons under the label of 
'fascists' or 'collaborators' were nothing of the sort. It was not uncommon for 
Nazi war criminals to share their cells with the flower of the anti-Nazi 
resistance.- Nazi concentration camps, such as Buchenwald, were reopened by 
the KGB in order to repress a new generation of inmates. 

Somehow, amidst the chaos, the ex-Reich had to be administered. Austria 
was immediately hived off. Germany, disarmed, diminished, and demilitarized, 
was divided into five parts-four occupation zones, plus Berlin, which was also 
split into four sectors (see Map 27, p. 1049). Since it was agreed at Potsdam that 
there should be no central German government, a clutch of ministries required to 
restart economic life had to be organized under the direct supervision of the 
Inter-Allied Control Commission (ICC). All aspects of local administration were 
subordinated to committees chaired by British, American, French, or Soviet 
officers. For the first two winters priority had to be given to mere survival. 
Germany's cities had been reduced to rubble; roads, railways, and bridges had to 
be rebuilt. Fifty million people, one-fifth of them refugees, had somehow to be 
fed and housed. 

German politics, however, did revive, in the first instance in the Soviet zone. 
A communist initiative group headed by Walter Ulbricht (1893-1973) arrived 
from Moscow almost before the fighting had stopped. When local elections in 
December 1945 suggested that the socialists of the Soviet zone held an 
advantage, the communists openly assaulted them, arresting their leaders and 
withholding ration cards. The results of the only free election in the Soviet zone 
were ignored; a forced merger was pushed through between communists and 
socialists. Already in April 1946 the resultant Socialist Unity Party (SED) was 
under Ulbricht poised for the creation of a one-party state. In these 
circumstances, the three nascent all-German parties, which began to operate in 
1945 under Allied proposals for Germany's 'democratic transformation'-the 
SPD of Dr Kurt Schumacher, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of Dr 
Konrad Adenauer, and the Free Democratic Union-were only able to function 
freely in the three Western zones. 


Communist machinations were particularly blatant in Poland. Ever since 
1943 the Western powers had closed their eyes to the crucifixion of their Polish 
ally [katyn]; and at Yalta they had handed Poland to Stalin on a plate. The 
results were disastrous. In the wake of the Moscow Trial of June 1945 (see p. 
1050-1), members of the wartime Resistance were arrested en masse; non¬ 
communist parties were mercilessly harassed; a vicious civil war was fought 
with the remnants of the underground; and the Tree, unfettered elections' 
promised at Yalta were repeatedly postponed. The country was run by an NKVD 
officer, Boleslaw Bierut (1892-1956), who was masquerading as a 'non-party' 
leader. The one representative of the London Poles to participate was powerless. 
The results of a dubious referendum held in June 1946 were drowned amidst 
news of a dastardly pogrom perpetrated with official connivance at Kielce. The 
elections, when finally held in January 1947, were so manifestly fraudulent that 
the US Ambassador in Warsaw promptly resigned in protest. - 

Yet Stalin's overall intentions were far from clear at this stage. If the conduct 
of the communists was bad in Poland and Yugoslavia-where Tito had crushed 
his opponents in a bloodbath of revenge-it was not so bad in Czechoslovakia, 
the West's favourite son. Benes and his Foreign Minister, Jan Masaryk (1886- 
1948), were still at the head of affairs. The Czech communists had a popular 
following; and they seemed to be responsible partners in the ruling coalition. 
Elsewhere in Eastern Europe the political situation was confused. Republican 
constitutions were adopted in Hungary, Bulgaria, and Albania in 1946, and in 
Romania in 1947. But the disappearance of the last Balkan monarchies, who all 
had German connections, did not cause much grief. A general increase in 
communist influence, as in France and Italy, was taken as a natural reaction 
against the fascist era. There was no sign of a fixed Soviet blueprint. 

Stalin's caution is easily explained. The Soviet Union was still in 
surprisingly good odour with Western opinion, especially in the USA. It had 
suffered appalling devastation, and desperately needed an interval of respite. The 
Soviet Union had annexed 272,500 square miles of foreign territory, with an 
extra population of 25 millions, and needed time to purge and prepare them for 
the Soviet way of life. Most importantly, the Soviet Union did not yet possess 
the atomic bomb. On this score alone, any physical confrontation with the 
Americans would be premature. The most sensible approach was to wait and see 
whether the Americans would carry out their promise to withdraw their troops 
from Europe or not. 


American counsels were long divided. There was a strong lobby in Congress 
which held that the Soviet threat was much exaggerated and that Europeans 
should be left to sort out Europe's problems. The contrary view, held by 
President Truman, agreed with the closing words of Churchill's Fulton speech: 
'our Russian friends... admire nothing so much as strength.' For two years, 
therefore, US policy hung in the balance. The advocates of engagement had to 
fight every inch of the way. Their determination was gradually strengthened by 
the insulting nature of Soviet propaganda, by the subversive activities of Soviet 
sympathizers, by the obstructiveness of Soviet administrators in Germany, by the 
Soviets' refusal to accept America's economic proposals, and by British advice. 
They finally won the day after the strategic decision forced on President Truman 
by the crisis in Greece in the spring of 1947. In the background, American 
concern was heightened by news of communist advances in China. 

The communist parties of Western Europe were greatly strengthened by the 
victory over fascism. They were particularly active in France, Belgium, and 
Italy, where their role in the Resistance was widely admired and where one- 
quarter of the electorate supported them. After the fiasco of a failed communist 
coup in Brussels in November 1944, their strategy was to participate in 
parliamentary and governmental coalitions. But then in 1947 a wave of 
orchestrated strikes in Italy, and in the French mines, destroyed the reigning 
harmony. Stalin's Western cohorts were seen to be damaging the progress of 
democracy and economic recovery. Relations between Western and Soviet 
administrators in Germany went from moderate to bad, and from bad to worse. 
There was no common language; Berlin remained split into mutually hostile 
sectors. In mid-1946 the Western Powers sought to realize the united German 
economic space as envisaged at Potsdam. The Soviets refused to participate. 
Thereon the three Western zones went their own way, assisted by a German 
Economic Council formed under Anglo-American auspices in June 1947. 

Until 1947, both Persia and Greece had been managed by the British. But 
suddenly, pressured by other major crises in India, Egypt, and Palestine, the 
bankrupt British decided that they could no longer cope. In Persia, the 
parliament had decided to reject an arrangement which would have seen Soviet 
forces retire from the northern region in return for huge deliveries of oil. In face 
of possible Soviet retaliation, American advisers were brought to Teheran. A 
new source of Soviet-American confrontation was in the making. In Greece, the 
civil war was reopened in May 1946. Communist rebels pressed southwards 
from bases in Albania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria. Britain's costs for defending 



the royal government in Athens soared; London appealed to Washington for 
financial aid. Instead of preparing its withdrawal from Europe, the USA was 
being asked to shoulder the burden of resistance against communist expansion. A 
decisive shift in global power was about to occur. 

President Truman's response was unequivocal. In applying to Congress for 
$400 million economic aid for Greece and Turkey, he spelled out the principles 
of a firm new policy. Tt must be the policy of the United States', he declared, £ to 
help free peoples who are resisting subjugation by armed minorities or outside 
pressure.' This Truman Doctrine of 12 March 1947 marked America's voluntary 
acceptance of the leadership of the free world. It put an end to prolonged 
indecision, and ensured that American troops would remain in Europe for the 
duration. Truman's stance towards communism came to be known as 
'containment'-a fresh version of the pre-war cordon sanitaire. It coincided 
closely with an analysis entitled 'The Sources of Soviet Conduct', anonymously 
published in July 1947 by the experienced diplomat George Kennan. It called for 
'adroit and vigilant application of counterforce ... corresponding to the shifts 
and manoeuvres of Soviet policy'. It was purely defensive, and far from the 
Third World War which some hotheads had advocated.- 

At this juncture the USA produced a generous economic scheme to 
complement its policy of increased political involvement in Europe. On 5 June 
1947, at a Harvard Commencement speech, Truman's Secretary of State, 
General George Marshall, unveiled plans for a European Recovery Program. Tt 
is logical', he declared, 'that the United States should do whatever it is able to do 
to assist in the return of normal economic health in the world, without which 
there can be no political stability and no assured peace.' In contrast to the 1920s, 
the USA was offering to finance Europe's recovery in the interests of the 
common good. The Marshall Plan ran for four years, from 1948 to the end of 
1951. It dispensed a total of $12,500 million to 16 participating members. To 
manage the funds, it required the establishment of the Organization for 
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which insisted that 
recipients increase production, expand trade, and make 'counterpart 
contributions' of their own. Although one-quarter of Marshall Aid was 
earmarked for Britain and one-fifth for France, it was made available to allies, 
neutrals, and ex-enemies alike. It has no peer in the history of enlightened self- 
interest. 

The USSR condemned Marshall Aid as a capitalist ruse. Moscow refused to 


participate, and ordered the countries which it controlled to do likewise. As a 
result, the hardening political divide was reinforced by a marked economic 
divide. The 16 countries of Western Europe who benefited from Marshall Aid 
were able to forge ahead; the USSR and its dependants were cast into self- 
imposed isolation. 

The European movement could trace its roots right back to the seventeenth 
century (see Introduction, p. 10; Chapter XI, pp. 949-51). But the ambitions of 
the national states had ruined every practical enterprise in that direction. 
Europeans had to drink the bitter dregs of defeat and humiliation before the 
dreams of the early idealists could be realized. They had to lose their empires, 
and their hopes of empire, before governments would give priority to living with 
their neighbours. 

The moral dimensions of the post-war European movement are not always 
remembered. One strand was centred on the survivors of the anti-Nazi resistance 
movement in Germany, for whom international reconciliation assumed prime 
importance. For them, the Declaration of Guilt formulated by Pastor Martin 
Niemoller, at the Stuttgart Conference of the German Evangelical Church in 
October 1945, was an act of great moment. Another strand was centred in France 
on a number of radical Catholic organizations inspired by the doyen of pacifist 
protest, Marc Sangnier (1873-1950), whose Gratry Society looked back in direct 
line to the Abbe Lamennais. Sangnier had been fighting for 30 years for 'un 
nouvel etat d'ame international', 'a new international state of mind'. He was the 
gum of Robert Schuman, and exerted a strong influence on policy in the French 
zone of occupation in Germany. A European Union of Federalists held a 
founding conference for some 50 activist groups at Montreux in August 1947. 
Other, specifically Anglo-Saxon strands were to be found in the pre-war Oxford 
Group of Lionel Curtis, founder of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, 
and in the actively anti-communist Movement for Moral Rearmament. 

In 1945, however, the immediate problem lay with the intentions of the 
British and American Governments. London and Washington were politically 
supreme in Western Europe. They could easily have taken the lead in the 
formation of new European institutions, or indeed in opposing them. They did 
neither. In the field of international co-operation they looked principally to the 
United Nations; politically, they were preoccupied by the growing confrontation 
with Stalin. They had no special vision for Europe. 



The lack of intent, however, was not immediately evident. Churchill's 
personal involvement in the early post-war years boded well for official British 
support. Only later did it become apparent that the ruling British Labour Party 
did not share his views. The most that it did was to encourage the discussions 
which was to lead to the Council of Europe (see below). A Labour Party 
pamphlet entitled European Unity (1950) stressed that £ no iota of British 
sovereignty' was negotiable. The Americans, too, exuded goodwill. The OECD, 
which acted as the conduit for Marshall Aid, seemed to be a first step in the 
direction of European integration. Only in 1949-50, when Marshall Aid was 
mnning down, did the limits of American as well as of British interest become 
clear. 

The first person of stature to identify the direction in which Europe was 
moving was Winston Churchill. Rejected by the British electorate in July 1945, 
Europe's most admired war leader had leisure to reflect. 'What is Europe?' he 
wrote. 'A rubble heap, a charnel house, a breeding-ground for pestilence and 
hate.' In 1946, in two landmark speeches that were to prove prophetic, he 
expressed views that were not very popular at the time. On 5 March, at 
Westminster College in Fulton (Missouri), with President Truman at his side, he 
spoke of 'the Iron Curtain': 

From Stettin on the Baltic to Trieste on the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent. 
Behind that line, lie all the capitals of the ancient states of central and eastern Europe-Warsaw, Berlin, 
Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest, and Sofia... This is certainly not the liberated Europe 
which we fought to build up.- 

Churchill rejected the likelihood of an early Soviet attack on the West, but he 
believed that Moscow was intent on 'indefinite expansion'. He called for 'timely 
action' of the sort that had been lacking ten years earlier against Nazi Germany. 
US opinion was 'almost universally hostile'.- In London, The Times bristled 
with disapproval, announcing that 'Western Democracy and Communism have 
much to learn from each other'.- 

On 19 September, in Zurich, Churchill appealed for 'a kind of United States 
of Europe'. Time, he said, might be short; the spread of atomic weapons might 
soon reinforce existing divisions. The first step had to be a partnership between 
France and Germany. 'If we are to form a United States of Europe ...', he 
declared, 'we must begin now.'- The future of the 'European family' depended 
on 'the resolve of millions to do right instead of wrong'. So the appeal was not 


economic or political, but moral. The Times sniffed at this 'outrageous 
proposition'. 'Even in Western Europe,' it commented, 'there is little to suggest 
that the unity so much spoken of... is on the way.' The founder of the pre-war 
European movement, Count Coudenhove-Kalergi, was one of the few to 
congratulate Churchill. 'Now that you have raised the European question,' he 
wrote, 'the governments can no longer ignore it.'- 

In this period, Churchill's strategic vision postulated a 'fraternal association' 
of three interlocking circles made up of the British Commonwealth, the 
'European Union', and the United States. Britain was to act as 'the vital link 
between them all'. He correctly identified the competing interests which were to 
cause tremendous strains in the ensuing decades by pulling British foreign policy 
in three different directions at once. 

Churchill's views made him the natural choice for chairing the Congress of 
Europe which was privately organized in The Hague on 7-10 May 1948. Some 
800 eminent invitees were asked to ponder the problems of European disunity. A 
strong German delegation attended, with Konrad Adenauer at their head. The 
cultural commission was chaired by the exiled Spanish minister and writer 
Salvador de Madariaga. In their debates, they recognized the principle of 'supra- 
nationality': the need for states to surrender part of their sovereignty in the 
interests of common institutions. Churchill's statement enshrined the loftiest 
ideals: 

We must proclaim the mission and the design of a United Europe whose moral conception will win the 
respect and gratitude of mankind, and whose physical strength will be such that none will dare molest her 
tranquil sway ... I hope to see a Europe where men and women of every country will think of being 
European as of belonging to their native land, and wherever they go in this wide domain will truly feel 
'Elere I am at home'. 

De Madariaga waxed equally eloquent: 

This Europe must be born. And she will, when Spaniards say 'our Chartres', Englishmen 'our Cracow', 
Italians 'our Copenhagen', and Germans 'our Bruges'... Then Europe will live. For then it will be that the 
Spirit which leads Europe will have uttered the creative words: FIAT EUROPA.- 

The Congress was undoubtedly carried away by the force of its own 
enthusiasms. But the final communique called for practical steps such as the 
creation of a European Assembly and a European Court of Human Rights; and a 
liaison committee was formed to keep the Congress aims alive. This latter body 
was destined to adopt the name of 'European Movement', of which it was indeed 


the progenitor. Apart from Churchill, its honorary presidents were Schuman 
(France), De Gasperi (Italy), and Spaak (Belgium). They had now to see whether 
any of the ruling governments might adopt their ideas. Given the truculence of 
the USSR, it was obvious that they could only hope for support from the 
governments of the West (see below). 

By the end of 1947, therefore, Churchill's Iron Curtain was becoming a reality. 
Three events removed all lingering doubts: the creation of Cominform; the 
February coup in Prague; and the Berlin Blockade. 

Meeting in the Polish mountain resort of Szklarska Por^ba in October 1947, 
communist delegates from the USSR, Eastern Europe, France, and Italy founded 
the Communist Information Bureau. Its purpose was to co-ordinate the strategies 
of fraternal parties. To the outside world, it looked suspiciously like a revival of 
Comintern, an instrument of subversion, the harbinger of a new ideological 
offensive. 

The Communist coup in Prague took place on 25 February 1948. The Czech 
communists had been sharing power with the socialists for two years; but their 
fears of a rising socialist vote meant that their own influence might soon decline. 
Their involvement in a genuine democratic system equally meant that they could 
not gain supremacy by manipulation, as in neighbouring Poland; so they resorted 
to force. Armed workers and militiamen appeared on the streets. Red Army 
garrisons were rumoured to be preparing for action. Non-communist politicians 
were arrested, and their parties dissolved. Jan Masaryk was thrown to his death 
from his ministry window. Klement Gottwald, the communist boss, said 'it was 
like cutting butter with a sharp knife'. President BeneS, pliant as ever, did not 
resist. For the second time in ten years, Eastern Europe's most promising 
democracy had been subverted without a shot fired in its defence. Western 
opinion took fright. Fearing a Soviet attack, five West European countries 
formed a 50-year alliance providing for economic and military co-operation. The 
Brussels Treaty of 17 March 1948, signed by Britain, France, and the Benelux 
group, was the precursor of the new security alignments now congealing. 

The final blow fell in Germany. The German Economic Council was 
preparing its new plan. The key proposals envisaged a radical currency reform, 
involving the exchange of ten old Reichsmarks for one new Deutschmark, and a 
new central bank-the Bank Deutscher Lander (the ancestor of the 
Bundesbank). The Soviet commissioner, Marshal Sokolovsky, would have none 



of it. On 20 March 1948 he and his aides marched out of the Allied Control 
Commission, never to return. The Grand Alliance was finished. 

Stalin had reached the point where restraint was no longer paying dividends. 
Soviet diplomacy had failed both to persuade the Americans to leave Europe and 
to prevent the growing integration of Germany's Western zones. With active 
American assistance, Western Europe could only grow in strength. So the time 
had come for the Russian bear to growl. The Soviet Army could not risk a direct 
assault; but it could demonstrate its hold on the vulnerable, and highly symbolic, 
city of Berlin. On 1 April 1948 Soviet patrols began interfering with traffic in the 
corridor between Berlin and the Western zones, but to no effect. On 18 June the 
D-Mark and the BDL Bank were introduced. This, from the communist 
viewpoint, was an act of aggression; on the 24th Soviet troops sealed off Berlin 
completely, to save their zone from invasion by the Deutschmark. The German 
capital was under blockade, and would remain so for 15 months. The Cold War 
had begun. 

Western Europe, 1945-1985 

Post-war Western Europe is easily defined: it consisted of the countries which 
were not occupied by the Soviet Army, and which did not fall under communist 
control. These countries belonged, however, to two distinct groups. One was 
made up of neutrals, who stayed outside the various military and economic 
associations of the era; the other, larger group was made up of those who became 
members either of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) or of the 
European Economic Community (EEC), or both (see Appendix III, p. 1335). 

Western Europe was also distinguished by the fact that in 1945 it was still the 
home base of the world's colonial empires. Indeed, with the exception of the 
USA and the Soviet Union, whose imperialisms did not conform to the 
traditional type, there were no imperial powers that were not West European. 
Germany had been stripped of its overseas colonies in 1919. Italy suffered the 
same fate in 1946. But the British, the Dutch, the French, the Belgian, and the 
Portuguese Empires were largely intact. The dissolution of these empires in the 
early post-war decades constituted a fundamental element in the changing 
European scene. Decolonization was a necessary precondition for the emergence 
of a new European Community of equal, democratic partners. 

During and immediately after the Second World War, many European 



imperialists had hoped that they would be able to keep, or to reconstitute, their 
empires. 'I have not become His Majesty's First Minister', said Churchill, 'in 
order to preside over the liquidation of the British Empire.' But he did. 

There were many reasons why, by 1945, the maintenance of Europe's empires 
had become virtually impossible. First and foremost, the elites of the colonial 
peoples, many of them educated in Europe, had learned the nationalism and 
democracy of their masters and were now vociferously demanding 
independence. The links between the colonies and the home countries had 
weakened during the war. There were no longer the resources available to restore 
them by force; nor was there the will to perpetuate the rule of one race over 
another. The USA, on whom Western Europe now depended, was resolutely 
opposed to old-style colonialism; and so was the United Nations. Imperialism 
was no longer either viable or respectable. The main question was whether the 
imperialists would bend to the wind of change or try to stand against it. Nothing 
better reveals the gulf between Eastern and Western Europe at this stage. At the 
very time that the Soviet Union was extending and consolidating its empire over 
the peoples of Eastern Europe, the imperial governments of Western Europe 
were desperately seeking means to dismantle theirs. For some reason, these twin 
aspects of European imperialism are rarely discussed under the same heading. 

The process of decolonization was immensely complex, and many of the 
complications derived from conditions beyond Europe. But each empire 
possessed its own ethos; each possessed a variety of territories ranging from self- 
governing dominions to colonies and trusteeships; and each wielded very 
different degrees of military force. Except for Britain and Portugal, all the 
imperial powers had been defeated and occupied during the war, and started 
from a position of weakness. 

The British Empire, which occupied an area roughly 125 times larger than 
Great Britain, was already in an advanced state of transformation. All of the 
'white dominions' had been fully independent since 1931; and many other crown 
possessions were being prepared for self-rule or native administration. Of 
250,000 employees of the British Colonial Office in 1945, only 66,000 were 
from Britain. The test case was India, a subcontinent of 400 million people 
where Gandhi's campaign of non-violent resistance had attracted world-wide 
attention. The postwar British Labour Government decided to grant India 
unconditional independence. On 15 August 1947 the last Viceroy took the salute 



in Delhi as the Raj saw the British flag lowered for the last time. India, Pakistan, 
Burma, and Ceylon all arose as independent states. There was an orgy of 
intercommunal massacres between Muslims and Hindus, but nothing aimed 
directly at the British. 

Several of the smaller dependencies caused much greater trouble. In May 
1948 Britain returned the mandate of Palestine to the UN after years of violence 
both from Zionist terrorists and from Arab rebels. In Malaya, the communist 
insurgency lasted from 1948 to 1957; in Cyprus, the war against Eoka from 1950 
to 1960; in Kenya, the Mau-Mau campaign from 1952 to 1957; in Egypt, the 
struggle culminating in the Suez Crisis from 1952 to 1956; in Southern Rhodesia 
(Zimbabwe), the emergency over white UDI from 1959 to 1980. Elsewhere in 
Africa, a procession of peaceful acts of independence started with that of Ghana 
in 1957 and Nigeria in 1960. At the end of the process, almost all of Britain's 
former colonies had joined the British Commonwealth, a voluntary association 
originally founded for the self-governing dominions. South Africa left in 1961, 
Pakistan in 1973. The residual administrative functions of the Commonwealth 
Office had been transferred in stages to the Foreign Office (FCO) by 1968. 
Preferential Commonwealth tariffs were terminated in 1973. The dissolution of 
the world's largest empire was essentially complete within a quarter of a century. 

The Dutch Empire, 55 times larger than the Netherlands, was closed down at 
one blow. The Dutch East Indies were never effectively resecured by the Dutch 
after the Japanese occupation of 1941-5. The Republic of Indonesia was 
confirmed in 1950. 

The French Empire, 19 times larger than France, expired in agony. Many 
inhabitants of the colonies possessed full French citizenship; and several north 
African departments, with large French populations, formed an integral part of 
metropolitan France. Humiliated during the war, French governments felt 
obliged to assert their authority, and wielded enough military power to make 
their ultimate defeat very costly. Tunisia and Morocco were safely disentangled 
by 1951, as were the Fevantine mandates in Syria and Febanon. But in Indo¬ 
china an eight-year war was fought against the Viet-Cong, until the disaster of 
Dien Bien Phu in May 1954 forced Paris to hand over to an incautious 
Washington. In Algeria, another vicious eight-year war against the FEN, which 
destroyed the Fourth Republic on the way, ended with General de Gaulle's 
dramatic concession of Algerian independence in May 1962. Preoccupied by the 
Algerian war, France had already set its other African colonies free. 



The Belgian Empire, 78 times the size of Belgium, collapsed in 1960, when 
the Congo sought to follow the example of its ex-French neighbours. The move 
was quite unprepared. The secession of Katanga caused a civil war which 
claimed the lives of thousands, including those of the Soviet sponsee, Patrice 
Lumumba, and the UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold. 

The Portuguese Empire survived longest. Angola, which itself was 23 times 
larger than Portugal, broke away in 1975, together with Mozambique and Goa. 

All the ex-colonies in Europe but one were set free. The Dodecanese were 
returned to Greece by Italy in 1945. Malta was given independence from the 
British in 1964. Only a clutch of small colonial dependencies clung on, including 
Gibraltar, which faced threats of a Spanish takeover, the Falkland Islands 
(British), the source of the Anglo-Argentine war of 1983, and the Marquesas 
Islands (French), the site of France's nuclear testing. Hong Kong (British) was 
due to revert to China in 1997, Macao (Portuguese) in 1999. 

The effects of decolonization were almost as profound on the ex-imperialists 
as on the ex-colonies. The former imperial powers were reduced to the same 
standing as other sovereign states in Europe, thereby rendering eventual union 
less problematical. They lost many traditional economic benefits, especially 
cheap raw materials and captive colonial markets. Yet they also shed the burden 
of defending and administering their distant possessions. They each maintained 
strong cultural and personal links with the Asian and African peoples, who could 
now send floods of voluntary immigrants to join the 'old country's' labour force. 
In the post-imperial decades, far more people from the Caribbean or the Indian 
subcontinent came to Britain, and Muslims to France, than ever came previously. 
Imperial race problems were imported with them. 

The decolonization of the West was watched in Eastern Europe with a 
mixture of surprise and envy. Official propaganda found difficulty in celebrating 
the national liberation movements of distant continents without giving ideas to 
their own subjects. Ordinary citizens wondered why so much publicity was 
given to the Arabs, the Vietnamese, and the Congolese. The intelligent ones 
wondered why decolonization should not also apply to them. For this, they had 
to await the era of Mikhail Gorbachev (see below). 

Once the Truman doctrine had been enunciated, it was necessary to create formal 
institutions for co-ordinating US involvement in Europe's defence and security. 
The Berlin blockade only emphasized the urgency. The foreign ministers of nine 



West European countries joined the US and Canada in a treaty founding NATO 
on 4 April 1949. 

In a sense, NATO may be seen as a replacement for the former Grand 
Alliance; it was centred on the same Anglo-American partnership dating from 
1941. In the first instance, it joined the Anglo-Americans to the signatories of 
the earlier Brussels Treaty, together with Italy, Portugal, Denmark, Iceland, and 
Norway. It was later expanded to include Greece and Turkey (1952), West 
Germany (1955), and Spain (1982). It was run by a political committee, the 
North Atlantic Council, based in Brussels, with its own Secretary-General. Its 
regional military commands, with air, land, and sea forces, covered the Atlantic 
routes between North America and Europe, and the full length of the Iron 
Curtain from the North Cape to the Black Sea. It was the prime instrument for 
the 'containment' of the USSR, which was now perceived as the principal threat 
to European peace. Its mission lasted for 40 years, and was carried out with 
indisputable success. 

NATO's first task was to break the Berlin blockade-which it did, quite 
literally, with flying colours. Relying on superior air power, relays of British and 
American transport planes undertook to supply a city of 2 million souls with all 
the fuel, food, and raw materials they needed. The airlift required 277,264 
flights; at its height, one fully laden aircraft was touching down at Tempelhof 
Airport every minute. Every day 8,000 tons of supplies dropped out of the sky. 
By the end, dozens of east-facing air-strips had been constructed across Western 
Germany, where the popularity of the Western Powers soared. The Soviets could 
only watch in silent fury, until they lifted the blockade on 12 May 1949. 

By that time, preparations for the creation of a separate West German 
Republic were well advanced. The previous July, in Frankfurt, the Allied 
commanders had presented recommendations to the premiers of the regional 
Lander, calling for the creation of a constituent council and the drafting of a 
federal constitution. Reluctant German leaders had been tempted to hold out for 
a united Germany; but the Berlin blockade removed their hesitations. The 
Grundgesetz or Basic Law was passed in the week that the blockade ended; 
elections were held in August. Konrad Adenauer took his place as the first 
federal Chancellor with a one-vote majority. The Bundesrepublik, with its capital 
at Bonn, took its place as Western Europe's most populous sovereign state. 

It was perhaps inevitable that the Soviets would respond in kind. The 
German Democratic Republic (DDR) provided a formal framework for the 



existing dictatorship of the SED, and was instituted in October 1949, with its 
capital in (East) Berlin. West Berlin, still occupied by the Western Allies, 
remained an enclave of disputed status, a loophole through which thousands of 
refugees continued to seek freedom in the West. The memory of a united 
Germany receded ever more rapidly into the past. 

Political life in Western Europe was restarted on the basis of a universal 
commitment to liberal democracy and a widespread belief in the absolute 
sovereignty of the nation-state. Monarchies survived in Scandinavia, the Low 
Countries, and in Britain, but only as national totems. There was much interest in 
Anglo-American democracy and, in the early post-war years, great admiration 
for the Soviet Union. Revulsion against fascism inhibited the nationalist wing of 
opinion, boosted parties seeking social reform, and made communism 
respectable. Proportional representation, and government by multi-party 
coalitions, were most common. Spain and Portugal had not been involved in the 
war, and were the only countries where pre-war fascism persisted. Three general 
trends can be observed: the rise of Christian Democracy, the tribulations of 
socialism, and the decline of communism. 

Christian Democracy, which before the war had often possessed confessional 
and clerical overtones, now made a fresh start free of ecclesiastical patronage, 
often in the hands of former left-centre Catholics. It had a 'left wing' connected 
with Catholic trade unions, and a 'right wing 5 that was not; party brokers 
managed the middle ground. In Italy, the Democrazia Cristiana (DC), headed at 
first by De Gasperi, was deeply riven by factions, but gradually edged its way to 
forming a national establishment. In France, the Mouvement Republicain 
Populaire (MRP) was created in 1944 under Georges Bidault and the Schuman 
brothers, but suffered from rivalry with the main-line Gaullist Rassemblement du 
Peuple Francais (RPF). In West Germany, the CDU of Dr Adenauer slowly 
emerged as the major political force. Adenauer was an old-time conservative, 
fond of the motto 'No Experiments'. But his partnership with Ludwig Erhard, a 
proponent of the social-market economy, was a winning combination. 
Exceptionally, the Dutch 'Catholic People's Party' remained a confessional 
grouping. Exceptionally, Great Britain possessed no Christian Democratic 
tradition at all. 

European socialism was especially prone to fragmentation, and frequently 
suffered from communist competition. Post-war social democracy shed its 
prewar emphasis on the class struggle, pressing instead for human rights and 



social justice within the capitalist system. The Italian Socialists of Pietro Nenni 
manoeuvred in the middle ground between the DC and the powerful communists. 
In France, the PSF of Guy Mollet moved away from its pre-war dogmatism, but 
did not enjoy much success until the era of Francois Mitterrand in the 1970s and 
1980s. In West Germany too the SPD, whose Godesberg Programme of 1959 
broke with its proletarian traditions, remained in opposition until the late 1960s. 
Once again the British Labour Party, a 'broad church' of very variegated 
tendencies, was something of an odd man out. 

West European communist parties, initially prominent, declined rapidly after 
1948. They normally took instructions and financial support from Moscow. They 
had a strong intellectual wing which ill matched the proletarian base, and which 
gradually disintegrated as the enormity of Stalin's crimes was revealed. They 
only remained powerful in Italy and France, where they regularly polled 20-25 
per cent, forming a solid bloc which rallied all other parties against them. In 
Italy, they played an effective role in local government, administering bourgeois 
cities like Bologna with success. In France, they eventually achieved a brief 
moment of 'cohabitation' with the socialists in 1980-1, before falling away for 
good. 

Post-war French politics were marked by the fundamental divide between the 
Fourth Republic (1946-58), which emerged from the Liberation, and the 
subsequent Fifth Republic. They were strongly influenced by the towering figure 
of Charles de Gaulle, who returned in triumph as Premier in 1944-6, retired in 
disgust for twelve years, reigned as President 1958-69, and left an enduring 
legacy after his death. De Gaulle, though a democrat, was an advocate of a 
strong executive, and a jealous guardian of French sovereignty-anti-British, 
anti-American, and, initially, both anti-German and anti-EEC. The Fourth 
Republic was blighted by immobilisme, 'political paralysis', caused by the 
attacks of communists and extreme right-the Poujadistes-and by a succession 
of fleeting, unstable coalition governments. On average, it saw a new prime 
minister every six months. It was temporarily rescued after 1947 by the success 
of the Gaullist RPF, which acted as a patriotic force for unity, but was destroyed 
by the effects of Indo-China, the Suez Crisis, and the Algerian War. The Fifth 
Republic came into being in 1958, when de Gaulle was recalled from Colombey- 
les-Deux-Eglises to quell the revolt of army officers in Algeria, which had all the 
makings of a military coup that could have spread to Paris. It introduced a 
powerful presidency, which was independent of the National Assembly and 
controlled the formation of governments. There was a major crisis in the summer 



of 1968, with sensational street-fighting between police and demonstrators in 
Paris; but it passed. Under de Gaulle's successors, Georges Pompidou, 1969-74, 
Valery Giscard d'Estaing, 1974-81, and the socialist Francois Mitterrand from 
1981, it found both stability and rising prosperity. The failures of the Fourth 
Republic turned many French politicians into committed European federalists. 
The assertiveness of the Fifth Republic led to great friction with the European 
Commission (see below) and, in 1966, to France's withdrawal from NATO's 
integrated military command. 

In 1962-3, however, General de Gaulle took a decision of lasting 
importance. He decided not only to make Franco-German reconciliation the 
corner-stone of French policy but also to give it institutional substance. Touring 
West Germany, he congratulated German youth for being 'the children of a great 
people', contrasted 'Germany's great crimes and great miseries', and praised 
Germany's 'treasures of courage, discipline and organization'. He restored 
German self-respect. By the Elysee Treaty of January 1963, signed with 
Chancellor Adenauer, he established a 'special relationship' which no other 
European nations possess. Henceforth, a comprehensive programme of Franco- 
German co-operation in foreign affairs, defence, education, and youth, cemented 
by regular meetings of heads of state, provided the only consistent source of 
leadership in Western Europe.- [douaumont] 

Post-war Italian politics have long displayed the same shortcomings as 
France's Fourth Republic, without ever producing a de Gaulle to mount a rescue. 
After the abolition of the monarchy in 1946, continuity was built on a strong 
consensus against a return to fascism, on the entrenchment of the Christian 
Democrats, who shared in all post-war governments, and on the vitality of 
municipal and regional politics. The consistency of state policy contrasted 
remarkably with the instability of cabinets. The polarization between the anti- 
Catholic and anticlerical left, dominated by Communists, and the conservative 
right has generated considerable violence. The terrorism of the Red Brigades 
culminated in the murder of a Prime Minister in 1978, and in the counter-terror 
which killed many people in the Bologna bombing of 1980. There were 
important divergences between the prosperous north, especially Turin and Milan, 
and the backward, Mafia-ridden south, which seemed impervious to reform. The 
Italian economy was slow to recover from the war, but made rapid strides within 
the EEC. Economic success offset political weakness. Italy was an active 
member of NATO, providing the bulwark of the Southern Front in the 
Mediterranean and the base of the American Sixth Fleet in Naples. Domestic 


political weakness has strengthened Italian adherence to European federalism. 

After 1949 West German politics were, frankly, unexciting-which was 
perhaps a sign of their efficacy. Seventeen years of the CDU's supremacy under 
Adenauer and Erhard gave way in 1966 to three years of coalition government, 
to a long period of dominance by the SPD under Willy Brandt (1969-74) and 
Helmut Schmidt (1974-82), then again, after 1982, to the CDU, under the 
chancellorship of Dr Helmut Kohl. The Constitution created a Bundesbank 
independent of the federal government, whilst reserving wide powers to the 
regional governments of the Lander (some of which pre-dated the 
Bundesrepublik). The central authorities in Bonn enjoyed the freedom to 
concentrate on their internal co-ordinating role and on foreign affairs. In the 
federal parliament the proportional representation of the Weimar system was 
amended to minimize the disruptive influence of fringe parties. Trade unions, 
remodelled on British advice, turned out to be more effective than in Britain 
itself. Though Germany was to rearm after joining NATO, defence policy 
remained very dependent on American leadership. The Wirtschaftswunder or 
'Economic Miracle' of the 1950s (see below) brought stability and prestige as 
well as prosperity, greatly assisting in the country's rehabilitation. Adenauer 
moved step by step, trading German partnership for Allied concessions. West 
Germany gained sovereign status in 1952, full membership of NATO in 1955, 
membership of the EEC in 1956, membership of UNO in 1973. After that, the 
political scene was enlivened or disturbed by the well-publicized activities of the 
anti-nuclear peace movement, of the environmental 'Greens', and, for a time, of 
the Baader-Meinhof terrorist gang. Decades of confrontation with East Germany 
were modified after 1970 by the Ostpolitik (see below), and crowned with 
success in 1990 through reunification. For years, West Germany was described 
as an economic giant and a political pygmy. This was not entirely just; but the 
burden of history undoubtedly inhibited an assertive stance, and it predisposed 
many Germans to the idea of European union. Critics worried about what could 
happen if Germany's prosperity faded. 'The German Dictatorship has failed,' a 
historian wrote in 1969, 'but German democracy has not yet been secured.'- 
Similar worries would recur again after reunification. 

Post-war British politics had to cope with a country whose traditional 
identity was quietly disintegrating. They were governed by the swings of the 
two-party Westminster system, by the stop-go performance of the economy, and, 
above all, by Britain's long search for a post-imperial role. In July 1945 the 
dramatic election victory of the Labour Party introduced an extensive welfare 


state and a mixed economy, where evenly matched private and nationalized 
sectors competed. In the next half-century, three Labour governments ruled for a 
total of 17 years, three Conservative governments (up to 1992) for over 30. 
Thanks to the near-dictatorial powers of the parliamentary majority, each 
government's programme tended to be reversed by its successor. The over- 
mighty position of the trade unions, for example, which had been encouraged by 
the Labour governments, was overturned by the fierce anti-union policies of the 
Conservatives in the 1980s. Attempts by assorted Third parties' to stop the sterile 
duel-by the Liberals, by the Social Democrats in the early 1980s, and by the 
Liberal Democrats-repeatedly failed. The unsteady performance of the 
economy created a climate of declining confidence. The long monetarist reign of 
Margaret Thatcher (1979-90) chose an authoritarian book-keeping style to bring 
discipline to all spheres that the government could reach. The effect, perhaps 
unintended, was to create an unusual degree of centralized power, which all but 
eliminated the voice of local government and the regions. Many British 
institutions had remained undisturbed for longer than anyone could remember; 
and a succession of disgraceful or divisive episodes in the City of London, the 
police, the royal family, and the Church of England heightened the sense of 
authority in decline. British society was increasingly polarized: the relative 
prosperity of the new 'enterprise culture' was matched by the decay of the inner 
cities and their despairing underclass, by falling standards in education, and by 
juvenile crime. The cohesion of the state was also being shaken: an initial surge 
of national separatism in Wales and Scotland in the 1970s was checked by 
referenda, which upheld the status quo. But from 1969 a virtual civil war in 
Northern Ireland required a strong military presence and brought provincial self- 
government to an end. Scottish separatism revived in reaction to the 
Anglocentric stance of successive Conservative governments. By the time that 
the strong hand of Mrs Thatcher left the helm, there was a widespread awareness 
of British democracy in crisis. 

As the Empire sank from view, however, Britain's principal dilemma lay in 
the need to choose between her precarious 'special relationship' with the USA 
and the prospect of closer links with her European neighbours. The natural 
inclination was to get the best of both worlds: to give unstinting support to the 
USA and to NATO, and to join the European Community as well. With luck, the 
British could combine maximum economic benefits with a minimal loss of 
sovereignty and historic ties. General de Gaulle spotted this ploy, and blocked it. 
After his death, British entry to the EEC was successfully negotiated. But in the 



late 1980s the old dilemma returned; sooner or later, the British would be forced 
to make their choice. British diehards feared that the United Kingdom might lose 
its soul; their critics argued that internal problems could only be solved in the 
European context. Amidst the confusion, some people wondered whether the 
United Kingdom would live to celebrate its tercentenary. 

France, Italy, West Germany, and Great Britain-each with populations over 
50 million-were by far the largest states of Western Europe. The smaller 
countries could best exert an influence by joining regional associations. 
Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxemburg had co-ordinated their policies 
informally ever since the war; they completed the Benelux Economic Union in 
1958. Riven by ethnic discord, Belgium turned itself in 1971 into a federalized 
union of three autonomous provinces-Flanders, Brussels, and Wallonia. In 
Scandinavia, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland, all members of NATO, joined 
Sweden and Finland, both neutrals, in the Nordic Council, formed in 1953. In 
their internal politics, various brands of social democracy predominated. 
Generally speaking, the smaller the state the greater was its stake in eventual 
European union. 

European fascism, though peripheral, was slow to disappear. The Salazar 
regime in Portugal was not overturned till 1974. Franco's regime survived in 
Spain until the Caudillo's death in 1975. In Greece, deeply divided by the 
conflict in Cyprus, a junta of colonels seized power between 1967 and 1974. 
Spain's transition from fascism to democracy presented relatively few problems. 
A programme of economic reform dating from the early 1960s had steadily 
removed many discrepancies. The revival of the monarchy in the person of King 
Juan Carlos provided a cmcial source of political leadership; and there was a 
strong public consensus in favour of Spain's accession to West European 
institutions. American support was also a factor. As a result, though negotiations 
between Brussels and Madrid were long and at points precarious, 141 sessions 
were sufficient for Spain to gain entry to the EEC in 1983, one year after joining 
NATO. Contrary to the gloomier predictions, the integration of a supposedly 
backward economy proved virtually trouble-free. 

The cultural life of Western Europe was conditioned by the climate of political 
liberalism, by great advances in technology and the mass media, especially 
television, and by a tidal wave of American imports. The overall effect was seen 
in the loosening of conventional restraints and, to some degree, in the reduction 


of national particularities. Freedom of the arts and sciences was taken for 
granted. Pluralism of views was the norm. 

In philosophy, the existentialism of Martin Heidegger (1889-1976) and jean- 
Paul Sartre (1905-80) came into fashion after the war, whilst in the English- 
speaking world the followers of Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951), an Austrian 
on the Cam, thought that logical positivism had rendered all other philosophy 
redundant. In France, the devotees of Jacques Derrida (b. 1930) and his method 
of deconstmction imagined that all rationalist thought could be taken apart, and 
shown to be meaningless. Marxism was modish in intellectual circles for twenty 
or thirty years, leading to what has been called 'the Great Confrontation' 
between Marxist intellectuals, fed on Gramsci, Lukacs, and Bloch, and their 
critics. The most devastating critique came from the Polish ex-Marxist, Leszek 
Kotakowski (b. 1927), whose Main Currents of Marxism (1978) served both as a 
handbook and as an obituary to the movement. European feminism received its 
modern manifesto in The Second Sex (1949) of Simone de Beauvoir. Sartre had 
written: 'Hell is other people.' His partner, de Beauvoir, wrote: 'You are not born 
a woman; you have to become one.' [laussel] 

Growing respect for science, a very American trait, affected all branches of 
study. The social sciences-psychology, economics, sociology, political science 
- exerted a profound effect on all the older disciplines. Perhaps the most 
fruitful alternatives to the arid trends of the time, however, were supplied by the 
Austrian-born Karl Popper (1902-94). Popper's Logic of Scientific Discovery 
(1934) overturned reigning assumptions about the scientific method. He argued, 
after Einstein's example, that no knowledge was absolute or permanent, and that 
hypotheses were best established by searching for proof of their wrong¬ 
headedness. His Poverty of Historicism (1957) demolished the pretensions of 
social science to formulate laws governing historical development. His Open 
Society and Its Enemies (1945) served to justify the liberal democracy which he 
would live to see triumph all over Europe. 

In the arts, the tide eventually turned against the disintegrating tendencies of 
modernism; and the 'post-modernist' blend of old and new gained ground. 
International festivals such as those at Salzburg, Bayreuth, or Edinburgh broke 
down national barriers. 

The communications media proliferated. In an age of almost total literacy, a 
free press flourished. Quality papers such as The Times, Le Monde, Corriere 
della Sera, or Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung were joined by popular news 



magazines, gutter-press tabloids, and from the 1960s by legalized pornography. 
Cinema, radio, and sound technology greatly extended the mass audience and 
created new art forms such as musique concrete. Nothing, however, could 
compare in the scale of its impact with television-whose general broadcasting 
began in France in December 1944, in Britain in 1946, in West Germany in 
1952. 

American influences were felt in almost every sphere, especially in 
Hollywood films, dance music, and popular dress. Youth fashions and 'pop 
culture', where adolescents dressed in unisex jeans jived and minced in imitation 
of film idols or rock stars, became entirely transatlantic and cosmopolitan. In a 
world conditioned by unrestrained commercial advertising, fears began to be 
expressed that 'the media was the message', in other words, that people could be 
conditioned to believe anything. American English-the language of NATO, 
science, and 'pop' alike-could not be resisted as the main vehicle of 
international communication. 'Frangiais' was officially condemned in France; 
but the teaching and, increasingly, the use of English came to be accepted as an 
educational and cultural priority in all West European countries. Mindless 
materialism, however, came to be regarded as the most insidious of American 
imports. It may have been very unfair to blame the USA for reducing Europeans 
to the level of economic animals; but Willy Brandt was expressing widespread 
feelings in this regard when he asked, 'Do we all want to be Americans?' 

Post-war social life was much more relaxed and egalitarian than previously. The 
war had acted as a great leveller: the old hierarchies of class, profession, and 
family origins did not entirely disappear; but people became more mobile, and 
rising standards of living ensured, as in America, that wealth and income should 
be the main criterion of status. Motorization proceeded apace, as did the mass 
adoption of domestic appliances. By the 1970s an absolute majority of West 
European families, including the working class, possessed a motor car, a 
washing-machine, and a refrigerator, and could travel abroad for summer 
holidays on the Mediterranean beaches. East Europeans could only watch with 
envy. At the same time, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European 
Community, which dispensed huge subsidies, served to redistribute wealth from 
the town to the countryside. Starting from the 1960s, several million peasants 
were transformed into relatively prosperous farmers. Primitive villages, 
especially in France, Germany, and northern Italy, were rapidly modernized and 
mechanized. 



A number of structural changes made a deep impression on social attitudes. 
The 'Welfare State'-which provided a wide range of services such as Britain's 
National Health Service (1948), West Germany's model pension scheme, or 
France's massive HLM projects for cheap housing-removed many of the 
traditional anxieties about ill health, unemployment, homelessness, and old age. 
But it also served to create a form of psychological dependence where people 
could relapse into torpor, expecting to be coddled by the state from cradle to 
grave. It certainly did not eliminate the problems of poverty, which in a generally 
affluent society were particularly bitter. Rising wages turned the masses into 
'consumers', pressured to become big spenders by aggressive advertising and by 
social emulation. Consumerism certainly fuelled the economy; but it turned 
material advancement into the goal, not the means; it threatened to reduce 
politics to a debate about the supply of goods; and it taught young people that 
possessions alone brought fulfilment. Since it put a dazzling supply of desirable 
goods before people's eyes, it was a more effective form of materialism than that 
which communist propaganda was advocating in the East. 

The 'sexual revolution' of the 1960s, facilitated by general access to the 
contraceptive pill, rapidly destroyed conventional mores. It eliminated the social 
shame of extramarital sex, bastardy, homosexuality, divorce, and unmarried 
cohabitation. In most countries it was accompanied by the de-closeting of 
homosexuals, by the decriminalization of consensual sodomy in private, by the 
relaxation of laws on pornography and obscenity, and by the widespread 
legalization of abortion. There were considerable variations in the tempo of 
change, with Denmark in the van and Ireland in the rear. And there was a strong 
reaction, especially in Catholic circles, where fundamental values of marriage, 
family, and human love were thought to be under threat. 

Religious life experienced a serious decline. Wartime horrors and post-war 
materialism destroyed many people's faith. Church-going ceased to be a social 
convention, and was left to the private inclination of families and individuals. 
Semi-deserted churches, lacking both congregations and regular clergy, could be 
encountered not only in city centres and industrial suburbs but also in rural areas. 
Protestant England and Catholic France were both badly hit. For the first time in 
1,500 years Christianity was becoming a minority belief. 

One response lay in ecumenism. From 1948 the World Council of Churches, 
with headquarters in Geneva, brought together the main Protestant and Orthodox 



Churches with the aim of voluntary co-operation. Its high ideals were not always 
immune from low politics. 

At first the Roman Catholic Church stayed aloof. In the 1950s, a minor 
French experiment of 'worker-priests' working in industry was suppressed by the 
Vatican. But the elevation of Cardinal Roncalli, a man of radiant humanity, as 
Pope John XXIII (1958-63) marked the turning towards comprehensive reform. 
His Encyclical Pacem in Terris was addressed, exceptionally, to people of all 
faiths. Mater et Magistra showed concern for world social welfare. His 
convocation of the 21st Ecumenical Council of the Universal Church, known as 
'Vatican IIU launched the most radical change of direction since the Council of 
Trent. 

Vatican II, whose four sessions lasted from October 1962 to December 1965, 
has been labelled 'the end of the Counter-Reformation'. In the battle between 
conservatives and liberals, many of the proposed reforms were diluted or 
rejected: the declaration absolving Jewry from accusations of deicide was passed 
in modified form; the proposals favouring modern methods of birth control was 
scotched. But the powers of the Curia were clipped; the obligatory Tridentine 
Latin Mass was to be replaced in the Roman rite by vernacular liturgies; the laity 
were given greater responsibility; restrictions on intermarriage were relaxed; and 
the seal of approval was given to ecumenism. Most importantly, a new, open, 
flexible spirit took flight. 

Among several new Catholic bodies, Opus Dei attracted growing attention. 
Founded in 1928 by a Spanish priest, Mgr Jose-Maria Escriva de Balaguer 
(1902-75), it seized on the special role given by Vatican II to the laity. When its 
founder moved with record speed towards canonization, it was seen by its critics 
as a sinister and irrational force within the Church. To its adherents, it was a 
blameless movement for spiritual regeneration, especially of youth. 

The momentum generated by John XXIII was maintained by his two 
principal successors. Paul VI (Cardinal Montini, 1963-78) was the first Pope to 
leave Italy since Napoleon had deported Pius VII. His Encyclical Humanae Vitae 
(1968), which reaffirmed the ban on contraception, dismayed the liberals, but his 
pilgrimage to Constantinople and Jerusalem, where he embraced Orthodox 
leaders, was a milestone. Limited approaches were made to Anglicans and 
Lutherans. John Paul II (Cardinal Karol Wojtyla, elected 1978) added immense 
charm and energy to the agenda. Actor, linguist, and globetrotter extraordinary, 
he took the Papacy to the world. In May 1981, in St Peter's Square, he survived 



an assassination attempt by a Turkish terrorist, possibly hired by the KGB. 
Implacably hostile to 'liberation theology', birth control, and clerical 
indiscipline, he was in some respects a fierce traditionalist. His suspension of the 
Swiss theologian Professor Hans Kiing (b. 1928), who had questioned the dogma 
of papal infallibility, worried many Catholic intellectuals; and his assertion of the 
Church's teaching on moral philosophy, as summarized in Veritatis Splendor 
(1993)U offended the 'relativists' in the field. Yet his horizons were broad and 
compassionate. In the West he entered the Anglican den at Canterbury; and he 
pleaded in person for peace in Ireland. In the East, he played a vital role in his 
native Poland, undermining communism by sheer force of personality and his 
support for human rights. He succoured persecuted Lithuanians and Uniate 
Ukrainians; he declared his respect for the Orthodox. For the captive peoples of 
the Soviet bloc, he proved to be the steadiest beacon of hope shining from the 
West. Notwithstanding the resistance of the Russian Orthodox, who boycotted 
his Synod of European Bishops (1991), he aimed to bring East and West 
together. He was deeply committed to the unity of Europe that was Christian. 

Contrary to expectations, the population of Western Europe grew more rapidly 
after the war than before it (see Appendix III, p. 1332). Affluence did not inhibit 
population growth. Wartime losses were rapidly restored by the ten-year post¬ 
war baby boom. The population of the 16 OECD countries rose from 264 million 
in 1940 to 320 million by 1966, and to 355 million by 1985. The country with 
the highest per capita income, Switzerland, also achieved the highest birth rate: 
in 1950-85 the Swiss population almost doubled. France's recovery was 
particularly striking: having remained stable at around 40 million for almost a 
century, the French population reached 55.2 million in 1985, thereby closing the 
gap on Britain and Italy. West Germany soon established itself as the largest 
single country (61.1 million in 1985) with the largest GDR Birth rates generally 
fell again after the 1960s, causing characteristic 'troughs' and 'bulges' in 
subsequent generations. But death rates also fell steadily. This affected age 
structures. Refugees and immigrants accounted for a significant part of the 
increase in Germany, France, and Britain. Whereas pre-war Europeans were 
predominantly middle-aged, post-war Europeans included growing cohorts of 
elderly and retired. There was a dramatic decline in the size of the agrarian 
population, which had dropped to only 17 per cent overall in the EEC by 1965. 


Western Europe's greatest success story lay in the realm of economic 



performance. The speed and the scale of economic resurgence after 1948 was 
unprecedented in European history, and unmatched in any part of the world 
except Japan. It was so unexpected and spectacular that historians cannot easily 
agree on its causes. It is far more easily described than explained. It clearly owed 
much to the start provided by Marshall Aid, to continuing interplay with the 
USA, and to the climate of liberal democracy, which greatly favoured unfettered 
enterprise. It must also be examined in conjunction with advances in science and 
technology, radical changes in agriculture, power, transport, and industrial 
relations. 

Marshall Aid was essentially a pump-priming exercise, which supplied the 
cash to sustain European trade and industry after the initial post-war upsurge 
faltered. But it was not interested in the design of the pump. To use another 
metaphor, it was a blood transfusion which gave the economies of the OECD the 
strength to manage their own recovery. Several of the largest American firms 
invested in Western Europe at an early stage. Dupont, General Motors, and later 
IBM all helped to create transatlantic competition. In due course many of the 
larger European multinationals-Royal Dutch Shell, BP, EMI, Unilever-were 
well able to repay the compliment. 

Contemporary economic theory and practice is very much the product of 
Euro-American interaction. The Keynesian revolution in macroeconomics had 
already established that government intervention had a vital role to play in 
nourishing the business climate, maintaining full employment, and managing 
recurrent crises through adjustments of money supply, interest rates, currency, 
and taxation. In due course the monetarist reaction against Keynes set in under 
the inspiration of Milton Friedman. Western Europe participated from the start in 
the international monetary system created in July 1944 under Anglo-American 
auspices at the Bretton Woods conference, where Keynes had led the British 
delegation. The resultant institutions, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
and the World Bank, both run by the United Nations, have strong European 
involvement, and to some extent compete with other purely European bodies. In 
Western Europe, as in the USA, it was taken for granted that democratic politics 
were a necessary adjunct to the effective management of a successful market 
economy. 

Science and technology moved into an era when they were promoted by 
huge state and international funds. CERN, the European Centre for Nuclear 
Research (1953)U and ESRO, the European Space Research Organization 



(1964), were among the major projects. National budgets no longer sufficed for 
expensive operations such as aircraft production. Modern agricultural techniques 
only reached the greater part of Western Europe in the 1950s. In 1945 British 
farmers were exceptional in using tractors; by 1960 even the smallest 
Continental smallholders did so. All manner of mechanization, artificial 
fertilizers, and intensive methods followed. Britain and West Germany remained 
food importers, but Denmark, France, and Italy became massive exporters. From 
the 1960s, Western Europe was embarrassed by colossal surpluses-the 
notorious 'butter mountains', 'wine lakes', and gargantuan 'grain hills' of the 
CAP. Power generation moved steadily away from the traditional coal to oil, 
natural gas, hydroelectricity, and nuclear fuels. France, in particular, made vast 
investments in hydroelectricity and nuclear power stations. The discovery of 
North Sea oil and gas off Scotland and Norway in the 1970s reduced dependence 
on foreign imports. 

The infrastructure of transport was expanded beyond all recognition. State 
railway networks were electrified and rationalized. In the case of the SNCF's 
Train de Grande Vitesse (TGV), introduced in 1981, France moved into the era 
of supertrains equalled only in Japan. The German autobahns were 
systematically extended; they served as the model for magnificent autostrade, 
autoroutes, and motorways elsewhere. Tunnels under the Alps or under the 
Channel (1993) and stupendous bridges, such as the Europabriicke in Austria, 
closed the missing links in a unified network. International waterways with huge 
capacity linked the Rhine with the Rhone, Rotterdam with Marseilles. The 
Europoort near Rotterdam, the largest in the world, was the focus of the 
ambitious Rhine Delta Plan of reclamation and flood control completed in 1981. 
Air travel progressed to the point where no West European businessman needed 
to think twice about doing a day's work in any European city of his choice, and 
returning the same evening. 

Post-industrial economies ceased to rely on the quantitative production of 
heavy industry. The service sector proliferated, as did the new retail structures of 
supermarkets and department stores. European iron and steel, after a famous 
boom in the 1950s, gave way to electronics, plastics, and sophisticated 
machinery. 

Here were the components for the mighty economic motor which began to 
accelerate as soon as Marshall Aid had primed it. With only two minor pauses, 
one in 1951-2 caused by the Korean War and another in 1957-8, every major 



index showed a relendess upwards trajectory. The Economic Survey for Europe, 
published in 1951, predicted a 40-60 per cent growth in industrial production by 
the end of the decade. The targets were surpassed in under five years. By 1964 
industrial output was more than two-and-a-half times that of 1938. Over 1948- 
63, average yearly growth of GDP was 7.6 per cent in West Germany, 6 per cent 
in Italy, 4.6 per cent in France, 2.5 per cent in the UK. West European trade was 
still growing faster than world trade, of which it accounted for some 40 per cent. 

West Germany's Wirtschaftswunder or 'Economic Miracle' lay at the heart of 
Western Europe's resurgence. Contrary to popular misconceptions, West 
Germany did not exceed the performance of all its rivals. Italy's miracolo was 
hardly less spectacular; and Germany did not generate the Continent's highest 
standard of living. But thanks to the sheer size and central location of the West 
German economy, it was vital to everyone else's success. Its psychological 
impact was enhanced because the starting-point had been so low. Its author, Dr 
Erhard, spurned government planning of the sort preferred in France and Italy, 
though certain key sectors were nationalized. The rest was left to efficient 
organization, heavy investment, sound training, and hard work. The figures 
spoke for themselves: in 1948-62 West Germany's foreign trade grew by an 
annual average of 16 per cent; West German car ownership soared from 200,000 
in 1948 to 9 million in 1965; in the same period, 8 million new housing units 
were constructed-enough to house a minor nation. Unemployment fell 
dramatically, bringing in a wave of Gastarbeiter or 'guest workers', especially 
from Turkey and Yugoslavia. Foreign investment in West Germany reached the 
point in 1961 when the government took active steps to discourage it. Industrial 
production (1958 = 100) showed how West Germany, having sustained the 
greatest damage from the war, travelled the furthest afterwards:

As matter for comparison, the GNP of West Germany was larger at $115 billion 
than that of all East European members of the Soviet bloc combined. 





Western Europe's triumphant economic recovery inevitably set minds ticking. If 
each of the national economies had prospered so well on their own, how much 
more might they prosper in unison, if all the manifold barriers between national 
states were removed? Here was the germ of an idea which would give the 
faltering movement for European union a new source of vitality. It would appeal 
not only to those who saw economic unification as a limited end in itself but also 
to those who saw it as an instrument for advancing a more fundamental political 
process. 

Not surprisingly, once the Anglo-Saxons had declined to take the lead, the 
European mantle fell primarily on the French. Unlike the Germans and Italians, 
the French had been restored to their place in the victorious coalition; at the 
same time they resented the secondary role allotted to them. In these 
circumstances, the less nationalist wing of the dominant Gaullist movement 
found itself facing a historic opportunity. On 20 July 1948 a strong statement in 
favour of European unification was made by the outgoing French Foreign 
Minister, Georges Bidault. After that, Monnet, Schuman, and Pleven would all 
rise to the challenge. 

Jean Monnet (1888-1979), an economist, had started his career as the head 
of his family's brandy business in Cognac. From 1920 to 1923 he was Deputy 
Secretary-General of the Feague of Nations; and in 1940 he gave Churchill the 
idea of a Franco-British union. In 1947-9 he headed France's National 
Economic Plan, which he pursued under a number of ministries. He believed 
fervently in full-scale European union-political and military as well as 
economic. His goal was to be achieved step by step by what was called 
'functionalism', that is, by steadily transferring an ever-increasing number of 
functions, or 'spheres of activity', from national to supranational control. He was 
the heir to Aristide Briand, and has been called 'the Father of Europe'. Robert 
Schuman (1886-1963), a Catholic Forrainer, was a leading disciple both of 
Sangnier and of Monnet. Before the war he had been a long-serving Deputy. 
During the war he had fought in the Resistance, and was imprisoned. After the 
war he became a founding member of the Catholic MRP, of which Sangnier was 
honorary President. In the musical chairs of the Fourth Republic, he was twice 
Prime Minister. At the critical moment, in 1948-50, he stood at the head of the 
French Foreign Ministry, the Quai d'Orsay. Rene Pleven (1901-), a member of 
the wartime Forces Fran^aises Fibres, was twice France's Prime Minister. He 
was the leader of the ex-Gaullist faction which deviated from de Gaulle's own 
path. 



The French group found ready partners in Paul-Henri Spaak (1899-1972) 
and in Alcide De Gasperi (1881-1954), Schuman's partners from the original 
Liaison Committee (see above). The former was a socialist, who held office in 
Belgium as Foreign Minister, Finance Minister, or Prime Minister almost 
continuously from 1938 to 1966. In 1946 he had been President of the first UN 
General Assembly. The latter, a Christian Democrat, was a bilingual South 
Tyroler, who served as Premier in successive Italian coalitions from 1945 to 
1953. Like Spaak, he was a strong supporter of NATO. Together they formed a 
formidable team, which set out to force the pace. 

In August 1949 the Council of Europe started business in Strasburg. Its 
minimalist mandate, which was to promote European unity by debate, publicity, 
and research, was determined by British reservations. It had no executive 
powers. Its 11 original members, including Great Britain, soon swelled to 18. It 
was run by a Committee of Ministers meeting in private, and by a public 
Consultative Assembly. Its commissions on crime, human rights, cultural and 
legal co-operation did useful work, as did the European Court of Human Rights 
over which it presided. But its vision was geared to a vague and distant future. 
Within a year of Strasbourg welcoming the Council, the far more ambitious 
Schuman Plan was unveiled in Paris. 

The strategy of the activists was to press for maximum proposals in the hope 
that a modicum of the programme would be accepted. They had to operate 
within a Western alliance still dominated by Washington and London, and had to 
be seen to complement existing arrangements in NATO, the OEEC (later 
OECD), and the Council of Europe. None the less, the Schuman Plan of May 
1950 proposed a far-reaching package of economic, military, and political 
institutions. It called for an economic organization co-ordinating the iron and 
steel industry and for a European army, which together would form the 
foundation for a United States of Europe. And it was prepared in secret, without 
advance consultation with London. In the event, the economic element took 
flight whilst the military and the political elements were shelved. Henceforth, the 
three strands of European unification were destined to progress along separate 
tracks and at different speeds. 

The main strength of the Schuman Plan lay in its appeal to Franco-German 
reconciliation. It appeared at a juncture when the Bundesrepublik stood on the 
brink of spectacular economic expansion, but when it was still politically 
isolated. Chancellor Adenauer, a Rhinelander, had lived all his life in the shadow 



of Franco-German wars; and he shared Schuman's liberal and democratic 
Catholicism. The prospect of harmony between France and Germany provided 
the fund of agreement which no one could reasonably oppose. Once rolling, it 
gathered momentum. 

The European Coal and Steel Community (1951-) was the first-born child of 
the Schuman Plan. It was designed to prevent the reappearance of a separate 
military-industrial base in each member country; and its first president was Jean 
Monnet. Its founding treaty, signed in May 1951, brought together The Six'- 
France, Germany, Italy, and Benelux. They agreed to operate free trade in coal 
and steel, to abide by common regulations governing manufacture and 
competition, and, in the event ofmanifest crisis', to control prices and 
production. It was a manifest success. Britain did not participate. 

The military strand encountered severe obstacles. The Pleven Plan (1950) 
floated a modified version of the military clauses of the Schuman Plan; but it 
still encountered the forthright denunciation of de Gaulle. Complicated 
negotiations dragged on for four years. The British were in no mood to weaken 
NATO; the French came out against a compromise organization, the European 
Defence Community (EDC). An eventual outcome was found in the Western 
European Union (1955), a deliberative body with few independent powers, 
which came into being just in time to experience the chaos of the Suez Crisis. 

The Messina Conference of 1955 marks the moment when the European 
movement turned to economic integration as the leading element in its strategy. 
The political strand was not making progress; members decided that a strong and 
successful economic community would open up the surest path for pursuing 
their long-term political goals. They were to hold to this course for more than 30 
years. The two treaties signed in Rome (25 March 1957) embodied the 
determination of the Six to extend the success of the ECSC into all sectors of 
their commercial and economic life. They gave rise to the European Economic 
Community (EEC), otherwise known as the Common Market, which came into 
official effect on 1 January 1958 and also to Euratom. The main aims were to 
remove all internal tariffs, to formulate a common external trade policy, to 
harmonize transportation, agriculture, and taxation, to eliminate barriers to free 
competition, and to encourage the mobility of capital, labour, and enterprises. 

In order to pursue these aims, four new bodies were created: the Council of 
Ministers, which was to control and authorize all policy decisions; a subordinate 
Executive Commission in Brussels, with a Permanent Secretariat and numerous 



directorates for proposing policy; the European Court of Justice; and a European 
Parliament sitting alternately in Strasbourg and Luxemburg. Once again, the 
venture prospered. Internal tariffs were abolished by 1968. The Common 
Agricultural Policy (1962), thanks to vast subsidies and despite the protests of 
manufacturers, brought a new lease of sturdy life to millions of farmers. The 
introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) in 1967 raised important revenues which 
could be used to spread the Community's growing wealth into deprived social 
sectors and backward regions. The first President of the European Commission, 
Professor Walter Hallstein (West Germany), guided its fortunes from 1958 to 
1967. Among his successors were Roy Jenkins (UK) and, from 1985, Jacques 
Delors (France). Whatever the criticisms of the EEC-and there were many-it 
was demonstrably true that its members were waxing more prosperous than the 
countries which stayed out. 'Anyone who does not believe in miracles in 
European affairs', remarked Professor Hallstein, 'is not a realist.' 

The European Free Trade Area (EFTA, 1958- ) was created in response to 
the EEC by the so-called 'Outer Seven', led by Britain, who had not been parties 
to the Treaty of Rome. Its interests were confined to the commercial sector; and 
its long-term future was constantly clouded by the likelihood of defection to the 
EEC. It played a valuable role until 1973, when Britain and Denmark left EFTA 
to join the EEC. 

Britain's membership of the European movement proved a bone of 
contention that rankled for more than 40 years. The UK Government did not 
participate in the ECSC in 1951, and dropped out of negotiations preceding the 
Treaty of Rome. The inhibitions were both psychological and practical. Not 
having suffered the sobering humiliation of national defeat, many Britons still 
harboured illusions of sovereignty and self-sufficiency. They also possessed very 
real commitments to the Commonwealth-including the thorny matter of 
Commonwealth commercial preference. In the political sphere, they gave 
priority to relations with the USA and to membership of NATO. In 1961 and 
1967 under Macmillan and Wilson, they twice applied to join the EEC, only to 
meet the shocking rebuff of de Gaulle's veto. Throughout the decade before the 
Treaty of Rome, de Gaulle was in retirement and France's European policy had 
rested with milder men. But de Gaulle's return to power coincided with the 
launching of the EEC. Conflict was unavoidable. The General was still nursing 
resentments about the alleged betrayal of French interests first by the British in 
wartime and then by the leaders of the Fourth Republic. He held strong views 
about 'l'Europe des Patries', a 'community of nation-states'; and he insisted on 



reinstating what he saw as France's sovereign rights. The results were seen in his 
vetoes against Britain's entry, and then in a long-running battle against the 
European Commission-'the Emperor versus the Pope'. French representatives 
boycotted proceedings in Brussels until they forced through the Luxemburg 
Compromise (1966)-an arrangement whereby members were permitted to 
disregard the rules of the Treaty of Rome on majority voting in matters of 
supreme national concern. 

The first two decades of the EEC were crowned by a number of important 
financial developments. The European Monetary System (EMS), which began in 
1979, tied the currencies of member states into the framework of an exchange 
rate mechanism (ERM) which was designed to dampen previous fluctuations. It 
was conceived by its authors as the initial stage on the long road to European 
monetary union (EMU). The appearance of the European Currency Unit (ECU) 
promised later moves towards a single currency. The European Social Fund and 
the European Development Fund were both designed to redistribute wealth into 
areas of social or regional deprivation. 

The Community's economic success ensured a steady stream of new 
applicants. In 1973, under Edward Heath, the UK was admitted at the third 
attempt, together with Denmark and Ireland. A British referendum (1975) 
confirmed the permanence of UK membership. The Six became the Nine. In 
1981, the admission of Greece turned the Nine into the Ten. In 1986, after 
lengthy negotiations, Spain and Portugal were admitted: the Ten became the 
Twelve. For the first time, the Community embraced three 'developing 
economies', and, in the case of Greece, an East European country with no 
contiguous frontier. 

Yet the military and political strands of European union remained stalled. In 
the early 1980s the Atlantic alliance was reactivated by the assertive Reagan- 
Thatcher duet; and the value of NATO was emphasized by the controversy over 
Soviet and American missiles. The political and international role of the EEC 
was peripheral. Its institutions, which were designed to fit a small Community of 
Six, were increasingly strained by the expanding business of the Twelve. In due 
course, one of the leading Europeans would call the Community 'a growing man 
still walking around in babyclothes'.- There seemed little chance that the EEC 
could soon break out of its narrowly economic concerns. 

One would like to think, however, that the creation of the Twelve had given 
birth to something qualitatively new. Europe had seen any number of alliances 


between the rich and powerful, any number of visions based on selective 
membership of the privileged 'West'. But now the point appeared to have been 
reached at which the European Community was changing itself into a voluntary 
association of equal nations-rich and poor, East and West, great and small. The 
main criteria for entry, apart from being European was that applicants should 
have shed the nationalistic, imperialist, and totalitarian traditions of the past. 
Only time would tell whether the change was permanent. 

The Neutral States 

Neutrality has been a feature of the European scene throughout the twentieth 
century. Eleven neutral states existed in 1945; four countries which had avoided 
involvement in one or both World Wars also declined to be drawn into the 
postwar military blocs; two countries achieved neutral status in the early post¬ 
war years. There was a high correlation between neutrality and affluence; and 
most neutrals did not make haste to join the European Economic Community. 

Switzerland, for whom neutrality was a way of life, thrived mightily. It had 
steeled itself to resist German invasion during the war, and saw a marked rise in 
population afterwards. It benefited greatly from the proximity of northern Italy 
and southern Germany, both regions of massive post-war economic growth, 
whilst continuing to play a special role in banking and in tourism. It welcomed 
numerous multinational companies and international agencies, from Bayer 
chemicals to UNESCO. Rhaeto-Romanic was raised to the status of a national 
language, alongside Swiss German, French, and Italian, and the French-speaking 
Jura was made a special canton. The defence budget was high, and universal 
male conscription remained in force to support the national militia. Swiss 
women had no vote until after the (all-male) referendum of 1980. Switzerland 
shunned the Council of Europe till 1963; its association with the EEC was 
limited to a free-trade agreement signed in 1972. 

Thanks to Switzerland, several adjoining territories have claimed the status 
of free customs zones. These include the German enclave of Biisingen, the 
Italian districts of Campione d'ltalia, Livigno, and Val d'Aosta, and, since 1815, 
the French departement of Haute-Savoie. 

Sweden had prospered from neutrality in wartime, and continued to do so in 
peacetime. It was the centre-piece of the regional Baltic Council, but remained 
aloof from both NATO and the EEC even when its Scandinavian partners joined. 



The long rule of Social Democracy carried on to the elections of 1989. 
Especially under its premier, Olaf Palme, who was murdered in 1986, Sweden 
took the lead in a number of initiatives involving Third World, refugee, and 
environmental issues. 

Franco's Spain remained a political pariah so long as the Caudillo lived. 
Indeed, the extraordinary longevity of both Franco and Salazar held Iberian 
politics in a time-warp until the mid-1970s. The anachronistic survival of 
fascism served to offset anti-communist opinion in Western Europe, especially in 
France. With Portugal a member of NATO, Spain agreed to receive American 
bases, but rejected any greater involvement. Mass tourism, however, militated 
against total isolation. The re-establishment of the constitutional monarchy in 
1975 opened the way for EEC membership, and for the remarkable economic 
resurgence of the 1980s. Basque terrorism in the north-west, Catalan separatism 
in Barcelona, and the intractable dispute with Great Britain over Gibraltar all 
complicated the Spanish revival. 

The Republic of Ireland had survived the threat of British occupation during 
the war, and left the Commonwealth at the end of it. But economic dependence 
on the United Kingdom remained a reality: Ireland had little alternative to 
following in Britain's contorted wake in negotiations with the EEC. Political life 
centred on the privileged position of the Catholic Church, on the endless conflict 
with Northern Ireland, and on the rivalry of the two main parties, Fianna Fail 
('Soldiers of Destiny') and Fine Gael ('Race of Gaels'). The Irish Constitution 
treated the counties of British Ulster as an integral part of the Republic. But the 
Irish Republican Army (IRA) was regarded as an illegal organization on both 
sides of the border; and relations between London and Dublin were not a major 
obstacle to a settlement. 

Finland, which had joined the German attack on the USSR (see p. 1013), 
escaped Soviet occupation, though further territory, notably Viipuri (Vyborg) and 
Petsamo, had to be ceded at the armistice of 1944. In 1947, however, a peace 
treaty confirmed the country's limited sovereignty in return for the lease of the 
Porkkala naval base. Henceforth, Finland was obliged to observe strict neutrality, 
to reduce its armed forces, and to pursue a foreign policy concordant with Soviet 
interests. After that, the economy boomed, and Helsinki became one of Europe's 
most elegant and expensive cities-a western showpiece on the doorstep of 
Leningrad. 'Finlandization' was a status which many Soviet-occupied countries 
coveted, but none, except Austria, ever obtained. 



Austria benefited from the Allied fiction that it had been the Nazis' first 
victim. Divided, like Germany, into four occupation zones, the Republic 
succeeded in regaining full sovereignty on the basis of a Staatsvertrag or 'state 
treaty' (1955) signed by all four occupying powers. The conditions included 
strict neutrality, plus the maintenance in perpetuity of Vienna's vast Soviet war 
memorial. The restoration of independence was followed by a period of 
unprecedented prosperity, similar to that in neighbouring Switzerland, and of 
relative detente. Politics was dominated by the nicely balanced rivalry of the 
Socialist Party, which held the chancellorship under Bruno Kreisky (1970-83), 
and the conservative People's Party. In 1986 an international campaign to 
discredit the Austrian President, Kurt Waldheim, formerly Secretary-General of 
UNO, did not harm him; but it served as a reminder of Austria's past. Austria's 
frontiers contained several aberrations. Thanks to a treaty of 1868, the two 
districts of Jungholz and Mittelberg form part of the Bavarian customs area. The 
provinces of Vorarlberg and Tyrol enjoyed free trade with the Alto Adige and 
Trentino in Italy. 

Seven European principalities, the last survivors of numerous historic mini¬ 
states, were too small to exercise an active role in international relations; but 
each has been well able to exploit its eccentric position. 

San Marino (founded in the fifth century ad, territory 62 km 2 , population 
23,000) claimed to be Europe's oldest state. Recognized as independent in 1631, 
it hugs the slopes of Monte Titano, near Rimini, and is entirely surrounded by 
Italian territory. It functioned after the war as a tax haven for rich Italians, ruled 
by a local government dominated alternately by communists and Christian 
Democrats. 

The Grand Duchy of Liechtenstein (founded 1719, territory 157 km 2 , 
population 27,000) had ceded its foreign policy to Switzerland. In 1980, at 
$16,440 it had the highest per capita GNP in Europe. It is the last surviving 
constituent of the Holy Roman Empire. 

The Principality of Monaco (territory 150 ha, population c.30,000) was a 
self-governing protectorate of France occupying a tiny enclave on the Riviera, 
east of Nice. Its modern status emerged in 1861; it had previously been a 
possession of Spain (from 1542), France (from 1641), and Sardinia (from 1815). 
Its constitution put government into the hands of the Grimaldi family. Its income 
depended heavily on the casino at Monte Carlo. 



Andorra (territory 495 km 2 , population c.43,000), high in the eastern 
Pyrenees, has preserved its autonomy since 1278, when it was placed under the 
joint protection of the Bishop of Urgel and the Comte de Foix. In recent times 
the powers of the latter were exercised by the Prefect of the Ariege on behalf of 
the President of the French Republic. It lived from tourism, especially skiing, 
and from duty-free trade. 

The Isle of Man (territory 518 km 2 , population 65,000 in 1986) and the 
Channel Islands (of Jersey, Alderney, Guernsey, and Sark-territory 194 km 2 , 
population c. 134,000 in 1981) were both British dependencies with English 
connections dating from the Norman Conquest. They were never formally joined 
to the United Kingdom. Both were wealthy tax havens. The Dame of Sark was 
still contesting her prerogatives with Westminster in the 1960s. In the 1990s the 
'parliament' of the Isle of Man was courting a showdown by failing to follow 
England's example in legalizing private homosexual acts between consenting 
adults. 

Gibraltar was the only British dependency outside the British Isles to join the 
EC. In this it followed the French Overseas Departments of Guadeloupe, 
Martinique, Reunion, and Guiana. All other British and French colonies, like the 
autonomous Danish regions of [faroe] and Greenland, remained outside the EC. 

The Vatican City (territory 44 ha, estimated population 1,000 in 1981) was 
Europe's last autocracy. Its ruler, the Pope, exercised the same unlimited 
governance over this latter-day papal state as over the Roman Catholic Church, 
of which it was the headquarters. Its nearest counterpart was the 'theocratic 
republic' of [athos], which has enjoyed autonomy within Greece since 1926. 

These survivals serve as a reminder that variety and tradition play a 
prominent part in European life. Europe has not been entirely submerged by 
power politics. 

Eastern Europe, 1945-1985 

'Eastern Europe' in the post-war era had two distinct meanings. It could 
reasonably be taken to refer to any part of the Continent which lay on the Soviet 
side of the Iron Curtain. In this sense, it included the European countries which 
had been incorporated into the Soviet Union and others which had not. More 
usually, however, it was used as a synonym for the satellites of the USSR in 
'East Central' and 'South-Eastern' Europe, as distinct from the USSR itself. 



In the last analysis, these distinctions carry only limited weight. None of the 
states organized on Leninist lines, whether as so-called 'people's democracies' or 
as republics of the Soviet Union, were supposed to enjoy any significant 
measure of independence. All were designed as facades for the exercise of the 
dictatorial prerogatives of the Soviet-led communist movement. By any 
definition, therefore, the post-war history of Eastern Europe can only take the 
policies of the CPSU as its starting-point, before moving to examine the ever 
more dyslectic translation of Moscow's wishes by Moscow's ever more 
wayward dependants. 

Prior to the terminal decline after 1985, the post-war history of the Soviet 
Union fell into three periods. The first (1945-53) was taken up by the last years 
of the Great Stalin. The second (1953-64) was dominated by so-called de- 
stalinization, during the rise and fall of Nikita Sergeevich Khrushchev. The third 
(1964-85), later labelled 'the Age of Stagnation', was initiated and inspired by 
Leonid Il'ich Brezhnev. Taken together, those four decades witnessed one of the 
grand illusions of modern history. The Soviet Union had emerged from the 
Second World War as the greatest military power in Europe; and it proceeded to 
turn itself into one of two global superpowers. To all outward appearances it was 
unimaginably strong, an impregnable fortress armed with the world's largest 
arsenal of nuclear weapons. At the same time, its internal processes were 
decomposing at an unprecedented rate; its body was riddled with the political 
equivalent of cancer. History is full of giants with feet of clay-the old Russian 
Empire was a prime example-but here was an armoured dinosaur which was 
dying on its feet. And no one saw its distress-neither Western sovietologists 
nor, until much too late, the Soviet leaders themselves. With a number of 
honourable exceptions, both groups spent most of those 40 years admiring the 
Soviet Union as a paragon of health and progress. 

Stalin's last years brought no relief to the long night of fear and suffering. 
Speculation that age and victory would mellow him proved unfounded. The 
same old gang of Stalin's pre-war cronies clung to power. The same mixture of 
terror, propaganda, and collective routine kept the Soviet peoples down. The 
gulag kept up the same regular motions of mass arrests and slave labour. There is 
strong evidence to suppose that Stalin, having discovered the so-called 'Doctors' 
Plot', was preparing yet another great Purge when he died. 

In those years the Soviet Empire expanded to its greatest extent. It did so 
through military conquest and through political surrogates who created political, 



economic, and social clones of the Soviet model. Shortly after the occupation of 
Eastern Europe, the major advance came with the victory of the communists in 
China. Mao Zedong had written that 'Power grows from the barrel of a gun'; and 
he triumphed in 1949 without the direct intervention of Moscow. He held 
somewhat different ideological views from the Soviets, and was well aware that 
Stalin had originally backed his arch-enemy, Chiang Kai-shek. But for the time 
being he was content to be a loyal member of the Soviet camp. For a dozen 
years, Moscow stood at the head of a movement which controlled the world's 
most populous nation as well as the world's largest state. The so-called 'Socialist 
Camp' contained half of humanity. 

Great store was placed on growing Soviet influence with the ex-colonial 
peoples. In the era of decolonization, Moscow saw itself as the natural patron 
and beneficiary of all national liberation movements. Its strongest links were 
forged with Vietnam, the Arab world, and Cuba. 

All available resources were thrown into the military aspects of nuclear 
science. At Mayak in the Urals, and elsewhere, teams of cosseted slave scientists 
laboured to produce the Soviet 'bomb'. An atomic device was successfully 
tested on arctic Novaya Zemlya in 1949, a hydrogen device in 1953. After that, 
the period of America's nuclear monopoly had passed. By the time that Stalin 
died, the Soviet Union had confirmed its status as a superpower. 

Stalin died on 5 March 1953 after suffering a stroke at his dacha in 
Kuntsevo. In his death-throes he was left lying on the floor for 24 hours. No 
Kremlin doctor who valued his own life was going to save Stalin's. The 
Politburo members kept vigil at his bedside in turns: 

As soon as Stalin showed signs of consciousness, Beria threw himself on his knees, and started kissing 
Stalin's hand. When Stalin lost consciousness again, Beria stood up and spat ... spewing hatred.- 


News of Stalin's death caused tens of millions to weep. 

De-stalinization meant exactly what the term implies. It removed those 
features of the Soviet regime which were directly connected with Stalin himself 
-the cult of personality, the edinonachalie or 'one-man rule', and the practice 
of random mass terror. It initiated an interval known, after Ehrenburg's novel, as 
'the Thaw'. When Beria was gunned down at the very first Politburo meeting, 
the collective leadership of his colleague-assassins was able to trim the power of 
the NKVD-now reorganized as the KGB. But they kept the dictatorial machine 


intact. They lightened the climate of fear, but introduced no significant measure 
of democratization or liberalization. The Soviet system retained its totalitarian 
character. Over three years, the collective leadership gave way to the personal 
supremacy of Khrushchev. 

The ebullient Khrushchev was perhaps the least obnoxious of Stalin's 
creatures. He was typical of the proletarian opportunists who had made their way 
up the Party apparatus in the worst years of the Terror. He had a black record as 
Stalin's boss in Ukraine; a late recruit to literacy, he was a cultural philistine of 
the crudest sort. Yet he had a rough peasant charm-especially when beating the 
table with his shoe at the United Nations. And he was surrounded by high hopes. 
Khrushchev's sensational 'Secret Speech' to the XXth Party Congress in March 
1956 must be seen in context. It set the precedent where every Soviet leader 
would ritually denounce his predecessor as a criminal; and its highly selective 
revelations of Stalin's crimes were carefully matched to the needs of the Party. It 
concealed much more than it revealed, and by minimizing Soviet criminality 
earned him an exaggerated reputation for honesty. It belongs to the evolving 
Soviet genre of 'openness' that ran from Stalin's own revelatory speeches to 
Gorbachev's feats 30 years later. 

Khrushchev's reign was notable for three signal developments. 
Misunderstandings over the policy of 'Different Roads to Socialism' led to great 
tensions throughout Eastern Europe, to open conflict in Hungary, and to the 
fateful split with China. Developments in military science and the launching of 
Sputnik, the first earth satellite, led to intense rivalry with the USA and to the 
Cuban missile crisis of 1963. The quantitative achievements of the Soviet 
economy led Khrushchev to boast that the Soviet Union would overtake the 
West within 20 years: 'We will bury you.' Khrushchev's adventurism thoroughly 
scared the comrades; in October 1964 he was removed in a Kremlin coup and 
sent into live retirement. 

Leonid Brezhnev, another Russian from Ukraine, dominated the Soviet bloc 
for two long decades. He has been blamed as the man who allowed the USSR to 
revert to 'neo-Stalinism', and to 'stagnate'. In time, he may come to be seen as 
the leader who understood the system best, who prolonged its life for as long as 
was possible. He was, above all, a cautious and canny apparatchik, who realized 
the consequences of tampering with a faulty machine. His brief experience of 
liberalization during the Prague Spring convinced him, quite rightly, of the 
unreliability of his closest allies and the need for the Brezhnev Doctrine (see 



below). His brief dalliance with economic reform at home, associated with his 
chief partner, Alexei Kosygin, convinced him that the risks were greater than the 
gains. His personal knowledge of Ukraine must have convinced him that the 
slightest relaxation of the nationality issue could only spell trouble. His pursuit 
of detente with the West, which combined an aggressive military stance with the 
careful delimitation of spheres, produced a stable arrangement that seemed to 
guarantee the international position of the USSR in perpetuity. 

Brezhnev could not fail to notice how the USSR had been built. But he also 
understood-as his successors did not-that eliminating the lies and the coercion 
must inevitably dissolve the fabric of the building. So Brezhnev sat tight. What 
his detractors were to denounce as 'stagnation 5 could be seen as the peace and 
stability for which he and his generation had longed. The most one could do was 
to calibrate the force and the fraud to tolerable proportions. Unlike Stalin, he did 
not kill people in millions; unlike Khrushchev, he did not go in for 'hare-brained 
schemes'; unlike Gorbachev, he did not destroy the system with which he was 
entrusted. 

One of the great ironies of the era became apparent when successive General 
Secretaries showed signs of a variety of wasting diseases that perfectly 
symbolized the Soviet condition. By the late 1970s stability was slipping into 
inertia. Brezhnev's speech slurred and his movements slowed to the point where 
jokers claimed that he was a corpse maintained on a life-support machine. His 
death turned inertia into paralysis, as ailing successors argued the contrary merits 
of reform and inaction. Yuri Andropov (1982-3), an exponent of reform, died of 
cancer before reforms could be started. Konstantin Chernyenko (1983-5), a 
victim of emphysema, had no intention of starting anything. 

The Soviet political dictatorship, which reached maturity after Stalin's death, did 
not conform to its popular image abroad. It was supported by the largest 'secret 
police' in the world, by the Gulag, by an aggressive brand of pre-emptive 
censorship, by a vast arsenal of tanks and security forces. But these were not the 
primary instruments of oppression: the dictatorship relied above all on the dual 
structures of the party-state, that is, on the civilian organs of the Communist 
Party and their control over the parallel institutions of the state (see Appendix 
III, p. 1321). There was no branch of human activity which was not subordinated 
to the relevant department of the state. There was no branch of the state which 
was not governed by orders from the relevant 'committee' of the Party. Whatever 



was going on, be it in the most august of ministries or in the lowliest of local 
farms, factories, or football clubs, it could only be legal if organized by the state; 
and it could only be organized if approved by the Party. 

The plight of the individual citizen was dire. Since state law and state judges 
were subject to the universal principle of Party control, anything which the Party 
disliked could be promptly and legally suppressed, without effective right of 
appeal. Since all human needs were supplied by state monopolies, any person 
who chose to defy the Party's wishes stood to be rendered destitute on the spot, 
or, as the jargon had it, to be given their 'wolfs ticket'. Recalcitrant individuals 
and their families could be routinely deprived of their residence permits, their 
ration cards, their identity papers, and hence their access to employment, 
housing, education, and health care. Once the Party's bureaucratic dictatorship 
was in place, the more violent instruments of oppression did not need to be 
invoked except against exceptionally courageous and resourceful dissidents. In 
theory at least, there simply was no place for private initiative, individual 
judgement, or spontaneous social action. In normal circumstances, it was 
virtually impossible to organize a strike, to form a private society, or to publish 
unauthorized information. News of popular uprisings, such as that at 
Novocherkassk in 1962, which led to huge massacres, could be concealed for 
decades. 

Party control over state institutions was exercised by an elaborate array of 
laws, levers, structures, and psychological taboos. Party control was enshrined in 
law. The only important clause of the Soviet Constitution was the one which 
proclaimed 'the leading role' of the Party. This simple device ensured that all 
other clauses of the Constitution, and all other Soviet laws, were subject to the 
interpretation of the Party and its officials. By outside standards, they were not 
laws at all. The Party rule-book was a much more efficacious document than the 
Soviet Constitution. The nomenklatura system ensured that every appointment, 
from the State Presidency to the chair of the village council, was exclusively 
filled by the Party's nominees. Each Party committee reserved the right to draw 
up lists of posts at its level in the state and Party hierarchy, and of suitable 
candidates to fill them (including lists of Party-approved 'non-Party' persons). 
As a result, Party members would generally hold one position in the Party 
apparatus and a second one in some state institution. The nomenklatura of the 
Party's Central Committee secured all appointments in the ministries, and in the 
supreme commands of the armed forces and the KGB. 



The management of all state institutions was further restricted by Party 
control exercised 'from without and from within'. The nominal heads of all state 
institutions-ministers, generals, ambassadors, leaders of delegations, all 
directors of factories, schools, or institutes-were formally obliged to accept 
instructions from a parallel Party committee. They were the servants of more 
powerful Party secretaries operating behind the scenes. At the same time, they 
had to bow to the day-to-day supervision of the primary Party organization, or 
'Party cell', made up of all Party members within the ranks of their own 
personnel. As a result, ministers qua ministers did not really run their ministries; 
army commanders did not command their units; managers did not manage their 
firms. 

Everything depended on the efficient transmission of the Party's orders. 
Party discipline ensured that the decisions of the 'higher organs' were enforced 
right down the line. Party members were sworn both to obedience and to secrecy 
(not least about the contents of the rule-book). They were trained to anticipate 
and to execute the wishes of their superiors without question. Open debate was 
discouraged; discussion was limited to the means whereby higher decisions 
could be implemented. 

These realities were so alien to the experience of democracies that it is easy 
to understand why political scientists could be so easily misled. All explanations 
to outsiders have to begin with the warning that Western concepts and Western 
terminology simply did not apply. The ruling Communist Party, for instance, was 
not a political party; it was a political army which had been transformed into the 
executive branch of government. The Soviet state was no more than the 
administrative agency of the Party. The so-called Soviet Government, i.e. the 
Council of Ministers, was not the government, since it was subordinate both to 
the Party's Politburo and to the Party's Secretariat. The chief executive of the 
system was not the President of the USSR or his Prime Minister, but the Party's 
General Secretary (who was free to appoint himself President or Prime Minister 
if he so wished). The Supreme Soviet or state legislative assembly was not 
supreme, since it could only register statutes prepared in advance by the Party's 
Central Committee. State elections, above all, were not elections, since there was 
no element of choice. Citizens were compelled by law to endorse the lists of 
Party nominees. 

In a very real sense, therefore, the Soviet Union never really existed, except 
as a facade for Party power. It was the grandest communist front organization in 



history. That is why, when the CPSU eventually collapsed, the USSR could not 
possibly exist without it. 

An important shift of political power took place in the Brezhnev era, largely 
unnoticed. In return for absolute loyalty to the policies of the centre, Brezhnev 
was ready to let the Party bosses of the 14 non-Russian republics of the USSR 
mn their affairs without interference. The Soviet republics were turning almost 
imperceptibly into national fiefdoms, where Moscow's writ ran ever more 
uncertainly. Brezhnev's regional baronies did not enjoy the same latitude as the 
East European satellites: they were prominently represented in the Politburo, and 
were an important pillar of the conservative order. But their emergence helps to 
explain why their centrifugal trajectory could accelerate so surprisingly and so 
rapidly when the signals from Moscow grew confused. 

The Soviet armed forces, though enormous and very prestigious, were 
deprived of all capacity for independent action: the Party left nothing to chance. 
It was not sufficient that all military officers were trained in Party-run 
academies, that they could only obtain promotion by joining the CPSU, or that 
they could issue no orders without the counter-signature of a politruk or 
'political director' working alongside them. The entire fabric of the military 
hierarchy was run by agents of Glavpolity the Main Political-Military 
Department, whose senior members included the most important marshals of the 
General Staff and whose juniors filled key positions throughout the lower 
echelons. As a matter of routine, rocket forces were not given control over their 
own warheads, parachute forces did not control their transports, tank forces did 
not possess their own ammunition or fuel. 

The Soviet armed forces comprised four main components-the strategic 
nuclear forces, the air forces, the army, and the navy. At their height they 
contained perhaps 10 million men. According to the wishes of their masters, they 
were designed to be the most formidable, or the most impotent, force 
imaginable. From 1955, when the Warsaw Pact was formed in belated response 
to NATO, the Soviet military became enmeshed in yet another layer of 
bureaucracy. They retained absolute control over the running of the Pact, whose 
HQ was in Moscow, not Warsaw. 

The scale and organization of the Soviet security forces bore little 
resemblance to counterparts elsewhere. To call them 'the secret police' was a 
travesty. The KGB was the equivalent of the CIA, the FBI, and the US Coast 
Guard rolled into one, with many other functions to boot. Apart from foreign 



intelligence, its various directorates ran the Gulag, the Glavpolit, the civilian 
militia, and the system of censorship. Its principal mission, however, was to keep 
itself informed of everything and everyone, and to root out 'unreliable elements' 
by all means available. Its uniformed officers, with their sky-blue epaulettes, 
could be encountered in every Soviet town. They commanded a vast horde of 
informers, thugs, and secret agents hidden within the population, and a duplicate 
army of up to a million crack internal troops trained to police the army, to watch 
the borders, to man the camps, to quell disorder, and to protect the Party elite. As 
their most public and sacred duty, they mounted guard on Lenin's mausoleum. 
Their headquarters in the Lyubianka in central Moscow looked out on a statue of 
Feliks Dzierzynski, their founder. It contained the most feared dungeons in all 
Russia. 

Soviet society, officially classless, was dominated by a growing gulf between 
the Party elite and the rest of the population. Once the Purges stopped, the 
members of the nomenklatura were able to entrench their position, to purloin 
state property for their own use, and to grow rich and powerful from patronage. 
The higher echelons were allocated luxury flats and dachas, expensive 
limousines, exclusive access to closed stores, Western currency, and foreign 
travel. They were, as Milovan Djilas declared as early as 1957, the 'New 
Class'-the proprietorial caste. The collectivized peasants, in contrast, suffered 
deprivations worse than those of the serfs. Until the 1970s they possessed neither 
social security benefits nor personal identity papers. The industrial workers were 
told that they had inherited the earth; they toiled in expectation of the improved 
housing, wages, and safety which never materialized. The intelligentsia-which 
in the official definition represented a professional stratum of 'brain workers'- 
enjoyed high prestige but low incomes. Despite the fact that several professions, 
such as medical doctors, were predominantly female, Soviet women received 
little relief from conditions that their sisters in the West would not have 
tolerated. As in Nazi Germany, the official ethos encouraged heroic child¬ 
bearing; abortion was the only form of family planning to be widely available. 
'Developed socialism' was, by European standards, very underdeveloped. 



Not surprisingly, earlier Soviet demographic trends started to falter, 
especially in European Russia. In the 1950s and 1960s the Soviet population 
recovered from the traumatic losses of the Stalin years, rising from 178.5 million 
(1950) to 262.4 million (1974); and there was a spectacular rise in the size and 
number of large cities. But the hardships of Soviet urban living were not 
conducive to carefree reproduction. By the 1980s both the birth rate and life 
expectancy were falling. Thanks to sustained growth in the central Asian 
republics, the dominant Russian nationality was declining. Even if the official 
figure of 52 per cent in 1979 was accurate, the Russians were poised to fall into 
an absolute minority. 

The Soviet economic system held to the basic methods and priorities laid 
down by Stalin-central command planning, militarization, heavy industry. Its 
fundamental failures were long concealed behind the screen of falsified 
statistics. Five-Year Plans continued to give the illusion of continuing 
quantitative success even when growth rates inevitably slowed and targets failed 
to be met. Global results still looked impressive right up to 1980:

Not till the early 1980s did the truth begin to dawn that global production figures 
were next to irrelevant, and that the Soviet Union's rivals were forging far ahead 
in almost every sector. 

Unknown to the public or the outside world, the privileged military and 
nuclear sector was consuming over 30 per cent of Soviet GNP-at least five 
times more than was officially admitted. At the same time, the overblown 
communist shibboleth of heavy industry continued to pour out unwanted iron, 
steel, and crude chemicals. The result was an economy which produced tanks, 





rockets, and aircraft in huge quantities but which could not support the basic 
needs of the population. All the most important elements of the civilian economy 
were woefully neglected. Soviet agriculture produced low-grade food in huge 
amounts; but was incapable of delivering it to the family table. The USSR 
became a net importer of grain, whilst domestic supplies relied increasingly on 
the collective farmers' back gardens (50 per cent of food derived from 3 per cent 
of arable land). Science and technology remained far behind the state of the art 
in the civilian sphere. Soviet conditions proved specially inimical to 
computerization and to the free flow of information outside the central 
bureaucracy. Motorization, which began in a big way in the 1960s with the 
purchase of a licence from Fiat to build Lada cars, was hampered by the absence 
of supporting services, especially modern roads. The service sector in general 
was no more than nascent. The consumer sector remained starved of goods. 
Subsidized prices in food and housing guaranteed a subsistence standard of 
living whilst nourishing a vigorous black market. The infrastructure remained 
woefully inadequate. After 70 years of progress, the Soviet Union had not built a 
single all-weather road link from west to east. The single-track trans-Siberian 
railway remained a solitary lifeline to the Far East. Aeroflot, the world's largest 
airline, was also the most overworked. The riches of Siberia could not be 
properly exploited. The more commands emitted by Moscow, the feebler the 
response. Notwithstanding Comecon, the East European satellites moved from 
being net contributors to being a net burden. Soviet export earnings were 
unhealthily dependent on gold and oil. By the early 1980s the combination of 
uncontrolled military spending and the diminishing returns of domestic 
performance spelled the onset of a systemic crisis requiring urgent treatment. 

Environmental protection was not a serious possibility. Primitive industrial 
methods and the pressures of quantitative planning left no room for ecological 
considerations. Even where environmental laws were passed, there was little 
chance that lowly elements of the bureaucracy could enforce them against the 
interests of the Party's main productive drive. In the totalitarian party-state, there 
was place neither for an independent environmental agency nor for grass-roots 
activism. As a result, the Soviet Union systematically created Europe's most 
scandalous examples of neglect and of persistent pollution. Blighted cityscapes, 
dead rivers, toxic air, dying forests, unmonitored radiation hazards, and declining 
health indices were all suppressed in the fog of habitual secrecy. Only the 
explosion of a nuclear reactor at Chernobyl in Ukraine in April 1986, which 
bathed half of Europe in fall-out, alerted the world to the dangers at a very late 



stage. 

Soviet culture was rendered schizophrenic by state censorship, which 
unwittingly divided all activities into official and unofficial spheres. Artists 
could only perform or publish if they belonged to one of the party-run 
associations. Their work could be categorized as the blatantly conformist, the 
trimmed, and the courageously defiant. Official culture centred on the principles 
of so-called Socialist Realism, which were laid down in 1934 and reformulated 
in 1946 by Andrei Zhdanov, [moldova] This style presented Soviet life in an 
idealized, com-pulsorily joyful, and essentially mendacious fashion. Some 
important deviations were permitted in the decade after Stalin's death. 
Khrushchev on the one hand permitted the publication of Alexander 
Solzhenitsyn's One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich (1962)-a grim picture of 
the Gulag. On the other, he excoriated Moscow's first exhibition of modern art, 
calling it 'the lashings of a donkey's tail'. Thaw soon passed into refreeze. A 
handful of talented artists preserved a margin -of independence on the fringe of 
toleration; but most of the great works of the era, from Boris Pasternak's Doktor 
Zhivago (1957) or Alexander Zinoviev's and Solzhenitsyn's major novels, had to 
be published illegally abroad. Many masterpieces did not see the light of day for 
20 or 30 years. 

Paradoxically, Soviet repressions generated a genuine thirst for independent 
high culture, a hunger for spiritual and aesthetic values which most free 
countries do not know. The immorality of official policy generated its own moral 
antibodies. With time, the most determined opposition hardened in the most 
educated circles of an increasingly educated society. (By 1979,10 Per cent of 
Soviet citizens possessed higher education.) 'Whether he wants it or not,' 
Vladimir Bukovsky once said, 'a Soviet citizen is in a state of permanent inner 
dialogue with the official propaganda.'- One of the earliest rebels was Andrei 
Sakharov, father of the Soviet H-bomb; one of the most eloquent was the 
Christian poet and prisoner Irina Ratushinskaya (b. 1954): 


And the sad tale of Russia 
(Maybe we are only dreaming?) 

Makes room for Mashka Mouse, and us and the radio set, 
On the clean page, not yet begun, 

Opening this long winter 
On tomorrow.- 


Religious life in the USSR was kept to a minimum by systematic persecution. 
The Soviet state was officially atheistic; Khrushchev in particular launched 
militantly anti-religious campaigns; the religious education of children 
constituted a criminal offence. The Muslims of Tatarstan and Central Asia were 
the least active, and the least troubled. But the Russian Orthodox Church was 
shackled hand and foot. Its clergy were state pensioners, its hierarchy supervised 
by the KGB. The Uniate Church in Ukraine, banned in 1946, survived only in 
the catacombs. The Roman Catholic Church survived only in Lithuania, its 
clergy decimated by assaults and deportations. With time, numerous Protestant 
and fundamentalist sects, especially Baptists and Adventists, came to be well 
represented. Judaism attracted harassment as soon as it showed signs of revival 
in the 1970s. In the decay of the Soviet ethos, the religious factor cannot be 
overrated.- 

There have been many attempts to characterize the essential qualities of 
Soviet communism. Many outsiders have stressed the gulf between theory and 
practice-as if the theory were genuine and the practice faulty. Yet there is a rich 
literature to show how intelligent communists came to realize that the theory 
itself was fraudulent. Leninist, Stalinist, and post-Stalinist communism always 
paid tribute to Marx and Engels. But they bore the same relation to intellectual 
Marxism that South Sea 'cargo cults', which worshipped American presidents as 
gods, bore to American democracy. From a very early stage, communism had no 
more serious goal than keeping itself in existence. Its heart was mendacity.- 

In most essential respects, the eight East European countries that were 
incorporated into the Soviet bloc (but not into the Soviet Union) followed a 
similar pattern of development to the USSR itself. Poland, Hungary, 
Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Albania all 
passed through phases characterized by stalinization (after 1948), and de- 
stalinization (at various points after 1953). Most of them were subsequently 
subjected to 'normalization', that is, the reimposition of Brezhnevian norms after 
an episode of open defiance. Most of them belonged to the Soviet Union's 
military 'alliance', the Warsaw Pact, or to the Soviet Union's parallel economic 
organization, CMEA or Comecon. All of them were mled by communist 
dictatorships which had learned their trade under Soviet tutelage, which justified 
their existence by reference to the same Leninist ideology, and which, with two 
exceptions, continued to owe allegiance to Moscow. 



Of course, there were important variations and important synchronie 
dissonances. In the mid-1960s, for example, there were some countries like 
Czechoslovakia which had not yet reached de-stalinization, whilst others, like 
Hungary, had already passed through both de-stalinization and normalization. 
Generally speaking, since their exposure to Soviet methods was shorter-40 
years in Eastern Europe as opposed to 70 years within the Soviet Union-the 
degree of 'sovietization' was much lower. Historians disagree over whether to 
emphasize the differences or the similarities. The fact remains, however, that the 
historical experience of those eight countries in the four post-war decades was 
tied to that of the Soviet Union and was fundamentally different from that of 
Western Europe. They were all subsumed in the category of'People's 
Democracies', which by no stretch of the imagination could be described either 
as popular or as democratic. 

In the first, Stalinist phase (1945-53), all the countries of Eastern Europe 
were forced to accept the type of system then prevalent in the USSR. In the 
immediate post-war years Stalin had insisted on close control only in the Soviet 
zone of Germany, in Poland, and in Romania. Elsewhere, whilst building 
communist influence, he had not insisted on rigid conformity. But from 1948 
discipline was tightened: all chinks in the Iron Curtain were to be sealed in 
response to the Truman Doctrine. All the main features of late Stalinism were to 
be ruthlessly enforced wherever they did not already exist. Cohorts of Soviet 
'advisers' and specialists were integrated into the local apparatus to ensure 
standardization and obedience. 

In this new galaxy, Stalin remained 'the sun of unsurpassed radiance'. But in 
each of the countries a string of lesser suns, of little local Stalins, was put into 
orbit. Bierut, Gottwald, Rakosi, Ulbricht, Georghiu Dej, Zhivkov, Tito, and 
Enver Hoxha were all Moscow-trained Stalinist clones. To call them 'puppets' 
was to flatter. 

Yugoslavia was the only country where obedience to Moscow was rejected at 
an early stage. Josip Broz, or Tito (1892-1980), a Croat, was in the unique 
position of having spent the war in his own country, of possessing ties with the 
Western Powers, and of setting up his regime without Soviet assistance. He was 
a Stalinist, with a nasty record of repressions. His multinational federation, 
dominated by Serbia, was closely modelled on the Soviet Union dominated by 
Russia, with all nationality problems effectively suppressed. The Federated 
People's Republic of Yugoslavia had come into being in 1945. Its Constitution, 



defining the powers of the ruling League of Yugoslav Communists and of the six 
constituent republics, had been functioning since January 1946. But Tito had 
built an independent base, and was not inclined to take orders. He did not favour 
collectivized agriculture, and he was interested in workers' self-management. So, 
when criticized by Cominform, he made no effort to mend his ways. In June 
1948 he and his party were expelled; for several years they lived under the threat 
of Soviet punishment. They remained what many believed impossible, both 
communist and independent-proof that there was life after defying Stalin. 
Belgrade made its peace with Moscow during Khrushchev's visit in 1955. But it 
never joined either the CMEA or the Warsaw Pact. Having left the Soviet bloc, it 
was free to take a prominent lead in the movement of non-aligned states. 

East Germany joined the Soviet bloc as Yugoslavia was leaving it. Political 
affairs in the Soviet zone had been conducted on the hopeful assumption that 
foundations were being laid for a united communist Germany. The failure of the 
Berlin blockade and the declaration of the Federal Republic showed that such 
hopes were false. The German Democratic Republic (DDR) was formally 
constituted on 7 October 1949, five months after the FRG. As in Poland, the 
DDR's constitution arranged for the ruling communist party (SED) to work in 
conjunction with a number of satellite parties operating within the communists' 
Front of National Unity. The first elections gave the Front a vote of 99 per cent. 
The Soviet occupation forces reserved important powers for themselves. The 
collectivization of agriculture was delayed until 1953, since the SED had only 
just implemented a massive land reform in favour of peasant ownership. The 
principal problem lay in the constant haemorrhage of escapees: for a dozen 
years, anyone could reach West Berlin by taking the U-bahn train from 
Friedrichstrasse to the Tiergarten. Over those dozen years, 1949-61, thousands 
of people availed themselves of the opportunity. The DDR was the only state in 
Europe with a declining population. 

The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), better known as 
Comecon, was founded on 8 January 1949 in Moscow, where its Secretariat 
remained. The founding members were joined by Albania (1949), the DDR 
(1950), Mongolia (1962), and Cuba (1972). At this stage, its main function was 
to assist in the theory and practice of 'building socialism' by Soviet methods. 

It is an open question how far the People's Democracies were formally 
integrated into Soviet structures. But it would have been uncharacteristic if their 
dependence had been left to chance. The main clues must be found in the 



inimitable mechanisms of inter-party controls. If 'socialist internationalism' 
meant anything, it meant that the CPSU could control the affairs of the fraternal 
parties, who in turn controlled the republics for which they were responsible. 
The International Department of the CPSU's central Secretariat was specially 
entrusted with this vital task; and each of its 'bureaux' were charged with 
overseeing the internal affairs of a particular country. Through its channels, all 
the leading posts in the fraternal parties could be subordinated to the 
nomenklatura system of the 'higher organs' in Moscow; and Soviet agents could 
be placed at will into key positions throughout the bloc. In effect, the Soviet 
Politburo could appoint all the other politburos. The KGB could run all the other 
communist security services, and Glavpolit all the General Staffs of the 
emerging People's Armies. For several years after 1945 Stalin did not wish his 
clients to have large military forces of their own; and expansion did not begin 
until after 1948. Soviet military advisers exercised such direct control that the 
need for a formal military alliance to match NATO did not yet arise. 

The most obvious sign of Stalinism taking hold was seen in the series of 
purges and show trials that smote the leadership of the fraternal parties after June 
1948. Stalin put the East European comrades through the same 'meat-grinder' 
that he had once used on the CPSU. In Warsaw, the founding congress of the 
PZPR in December 1948 saw the grovelling self-criticism of Wladyslaw 
Gomulka, before charges of 'national deviation'. In Sofia, Traichov Rostov, the 
Deputy Prime Minister, was tried and executed on charges of Titoism. In Tirana, 
Koci Dzodze was sentenced to death for allegedly plotting to give Albania to 
Yugoslavia. In Budapest, the Foreign Minister, Laszlo Rajk, was tried and 
executed. In Prague, after years of slurs and test trials, the finger was pointed 
directly at General Secretary Rudolf Slansky. At Slansky's trial in November 
1952, in which 11 of 14 defendants were Jewish, charges of Zionism were added 
to the more usual ones of Titoism, Trotskyism, anti-Sovietism and foreign 
espionage. 

In the second, post-Stalinist phase (1953-68), the Soviet satellites worked their 
way towards a stage that has been variously labelled as 'national communism' or 
'polycentrism'. Each of the fraternal parties was to claim the right to fix its own 
separate 'road to socialism'. The CPSU reserved the right to intervene by force if 
the gains of socialism were in danger. 'Gains of socialism' was a codeword for 
communist monopoly power and for loyalty to the Kremlin. 



In the climate of uncertainty fostered by the in-fighting of Moscow's 
collective leadership, the more courageous elements took matters into their own 
hands. On 17 June 1953 workers in East Berlin staged demonstrations that 
threatened open rebellion. They were mercilessly cmshed by Soviet tanks. A 
similar outburst occurred in Plsen in Czechoslovakia. Popular protest still lay 
beyond the pale of the tolerable. In Poland, the Party quietly dropped several 
keystone policies. Forcible collectivization was halted; the hated Soviet-mn 
Ministry of Security was replaced; jailed Party leaders, and the jailed Primate, 
were released. A communist poet was allowed to publish a Poem for Adults 
which daringly stated that life was less than perfect: 


They ran to us shouting 
'Under Socialism 
A cut finger doesn't hurt.' 

But they felt pain. 

They lost faith. 

There are overworked people ... 

There are Polish apples unavailable for children ... 

There are girls forced to tell lies... 

There are people slandered and spat on, 
assaulted on the streets 

by common hoodlums undefined by the law .. .- 

The Warsaw Pact came into being on 14 May 1955. The armies of the 
People's Democracies had been growing for seven years; and the point had been 
reached where the native officer corps had to assume greater responsibility. 
Thanks to the integrated political structures, the Warsaw Pact was not a genuine 
alliance of free and equal partners; none of the members' armies had the capacity 
for independent action. But there were obvious military advantages in 
standardized weaponry and joint training; and a strong gesture was made to 
national pride. A strong signal was sent to NATO against the admission of West 
Germany. 

The critical year proved to be 1956. Khrushchev's Speech at the XXth 
Congress inevitably propelled a shock-wave right across Eastern Europe. The 
fraternal parties had to come to terms with Stalin's crimes against them. The 


Polish delegation, for example, which leaked the proceedings to the Western 
press, learned that the entire leadership of the pre-war Polish communist 
movement had been murdered on imaginary charges. Bierut died of a heart 
attack on the spot. By the summer, developments were reaching boiling point. 
Popular unrest welled up, as the old guard of the ruling parties was rocked by 
demands of would-be reformers. In Poznan, in June, 53 workers were killed 
when the Polish army fired on demonstrators carrying banners demanding 
'Bread and Freedom 5 and 'Russians Go Home 5 . In October, first in Warsaw and 
then in Budapest, two fraternal parties took the momentous step of changing the 
composition of their politburos without first clearing their choice in Moscow. 

Khrushchev's management of the East European crisis was facilitated by its 
coincidence with the presidential election in the USA and with the Suez Crisis. 
The Western Powers were distracted by their differences over the Middle East; 
the USSR was left with a free hand in Warsaw and Budapest. 

On Sunday 21 October an apoplectic Khrushchev flew into Warsaw 
unannounced. He found the city ringed with Polish commandos in full battle 
gear and ., the Polish leadership steadfast in its support for Wladyslaw Gomulka. 
(Later rumour held that the Polish army had planned to break through East 
Germany into NATO lines.) Two days of talks showed thatGomulka's 'Polish 
Road to socialism' was not inimical to basic Soviet interests, and that open 
warfare with his largest, and reputedly most courageous, ally was not exactly 
desirable. So Khrushchev backed down-agreeing thatGomulka's election as 
General Secretary should stand, and that Marshal Rokossowski and his advisers 
should be withdrawn. For a spell,Gomulka basked in the glow of being Poland's 
one and only popular communist leader. 

In Budapest, events took the fatal turn which might so easily have afflicted 
Warsaw. Khrushchev was anxious that his generosity to the Yugoslavs, and now 
to the Poles, should not be construed as a sign of general weakness. The 
suppression of Hungary posed fewer military problems than action in Poland. 
And the Hungarian comrades, unlike the Poles, were deeply divided. On the 
night of 23-4 October, at the exact moment that the Polish crisis was defused, 
the Hungarian Party's Stalinist Secretary and security chief, Erno Gero, Rakosi's 
successor, called for Soviet military intervention to save him from dismissal. 
Hungary was battered into submission in less than a month. At first it seemed 
that an accommodation would be reached. The Soviet Army retreated from the 
capital; the Soviet Ambassador, Yuri Andropov, abandoned Gero and approved 



his replacement by Janos Kadar-a loyal communist who, like Gomulka, had 
suffered Stalinist persecution. This seemed to check the progress of Imre Nagy, 
the leader of the Party's reformist faction, who had emerged as Prime Minister. 
The Soviet Army's final departure was said to be under negotiation. Khrushchev 
was making a second visit to Tito at Brioni. But then Nagy admitted several non¬ 
communists into his government, breaking the communist monopoly. The 
release of the Primate, Cardinal Mindszenty, sparked enthusiastic 
demonstrations, followed by ugly attacks on the hated security police. On 2 
November popular pressure pushed the Government into appealing for 
assistance from the United Nations, and announcing Hungary's withdrawal from 
the Warsaw Pact. At dawn on the 4th, Soviet armoured divisions poured back 
into Budapest without warning. For ten days, heroic youths fought the tanks with 
their bare hands. Blood flowed copiously. Nagy took refuge in the Yugoslav 
embassy, which he left on a Soviet safe-conduct, only to be promptly arrested. In 
due course, after incarceration in Romania, he and 2,000 followers were shot. 
Hundreds of thousands of refugees flooded into Austria. The final toll of 
casualties reached similar proportions. Hungary was left in the hands of 
Andropov's client, Kadar, and a 'revolutionary government of workers and 
peasants'. 

Hungary's national rising left an indelible stain on the Soviet record. It 
showed the world that communism was impervious to popular demands. It 
destroyed the lingering sympathies of many leftists, ruined the future for 
communist parties in the West, and greatly increased the tensions of the Cold 
War. In the Soviet bloc itself, it offended Mao Zedong, who favoured national 
variants of communism, and who had tried to intercede on behalf ofGomulka 
and Nagy. It also provided the impetus for a new general economic strategy, of 
which the victors of Budapest, Andropov and Kadar, were among the chief 
proponents. But its lessons were not learned by everyone. Czechoslovakia had to 
go through a similar ordeal before the rules of the post-Stalinist game were fully 
understood. 

The Sino-Soviet split, when it came in 1960, had direct repercussions in only 
one European country, Albania. Like the Chinese, the Albanian comrades had 
important reservations about de-stalinization. What is more, since they had been 
cut off by Tito's break with Stalin and did not possess a frontier with the rest of 
the bloc, they were shielded from Soviet intervention. So they took the 'Chinese 
Road': Tirana shifted its loyalties from Moscow to Peking. It remained fully 
Stalinist, totally collectivized and atheized, utterly isolated, and at odds with all 



its neighbours. Nothing was to change until 1990. The only religion in Albania', 
declared Enver Hoxha, 'is being an Albanian.' [shqiperia] 

The new Soviet economic strategy of the 1960s was adopted partly in 
imitation of the EEC and partly in recognition of the shortcomings of existing 
Stalinist methods. One development was to raise the profile of the CMEA as the 
coordinator of joint planning. The CMEA allocated specialized tasks to each 
member country, and put great store on the dissemination of modern science and 
technology. This satisfied everyone, except Romania. But the main pilot scheme 
was launched in Hungary. Andropov, now head of the CPSU's International 
Department, and Kadar both realized that the reign of terror which followed the 
Hungarian rising had created an opening for intelligent economic 
experimentation. Economic reform could proceed without the threat of political 
turbulence. 'Goulash communism' would cure well-fed citizens of their dreams 
of liberty. The main idea was to introduce limited market mechanisms into a 
system still controlled by the state, and to encourage enterprise, especially in 
agriculture, by relaxing controls on compulsory deliveries and land ownership. 
Results came swiftly: by the mid-1960s Hungary's prosperity was leading people 
to forget its political misery. Budapest was a city of thriving restaurants, 
groaning shelves, and no politics. 'Kadarization' seemed to offer an attractive 
compromise between communism and capitalism, especially to Western 
economists with no political sense. 

Three countries failed to react to the developing trends-each for different 
reasons. 

The German Democratic Republic was the most unnatural of all the People's 
Democracies. Its rigid ideological conformism and excessive pro-Sovietism 
were fostered by the Stasi, a security apparatus of fearful reputation. It was 
blighted by the continuing division of Berlin, by the presence of nearly 40 
divisions of Soviet occupation troops, above all by the steady exodus of its 
citizens. On 13 August 1961 all the crossings between East and West Berlin 
were sealed. For the next 28 years the Berlin Wall turned the DDR into a cage, 
the most visible symbol of communist oppression in Europe. All thoughts of a 
united Germany were dropped in favour of a theory that East Germany was 
inhabited by a separate nation with separate traditions. Great efforts were made 
to force the pace of heavy industrialization, and to win international recognition 
through massive state sponsorship of Olympic sport. By the time that Ulbricht 
gave way as General Secretary to Erich Honecker in 1971, a modus vivendi was 



about to be reached with West Germany. Yet the spirit of the 1950s lingered on 
in the DDR for 30 years. 'We so love Germany/ said one French minister with 
no little irony, 'we prefer there to be two of them/ 

Romania jibbed against all the changes, but never forced an open breach. 
Nicolae Ceausescu (1918-89), who became General Secretary of the Romanian 
League of Communists in 1965, pursued a line that was as eccentric as it was 
disreputable. As Conducator he created a neo-Stalinist cult of personality and a 
brand of nepotistic despotism that was well described as 'socialism in one 
family'. He invented a constitution announcing Romania's arrival in the highest 
'socialist' stage of development, whilst keeping his people in fear and beggary. 
His dreaded Securitate made the KGB of the epoch look like real gentlemen. He 
gained a minimum of diplomatic leverage by balancing between Moscow and 
Peking; and he gained a measure of (undeserved) Western admiration by 
recognizing Israel and by staying on the margins of the CMEA and the Warsaw 
Pact. He stayed at Buckingham Palace, with his own taster, and, on the advice of 
the Foreign Office, was knighted by the Queen of England. Romania has been 
aptly called the North Korea of Eastern Europe-a closed country acutely aware 
of its inferiority, excessively proud of its dubious record, and instinctively given 
to acting as mediator between other Mafia gangs. 

Bulgaria competed with East Germany for the laurels of grim immobility. 
Industrialization started late, as did the state's exploitation of tourism and the 
wine trade. The Party leader, Todor Zhivkov, held the country on its slavishly 
pro-Soviet course from 1954 to 1990. 

Czechoslovakia resisted de-stalinization until January 1968. The rule of 
Antonin Novotny, General Secretary since Gottwald's death in 1953, paid no 
attention to political relaxation in Poland on one side or to the economic reforms 
in Hungary on the other. He was finally overturned by a coalition in the 
Politburo of Slovaks disgruntled with Czech dominance and Czechs eager for 
systemic reform. The new leader, Alexander Dubcek (1927-93), was a mild- 
mannered Slovak communist, the only General Secretary in the history of the 
bloc to be endowed with smiling eyes. True to character, he declared for 
'socialism with a human face'. 

The Prague Spring burst into bud with intoxicating vigour. Dubcek and his 
team were planning the imposition of reforms from above. But they suspended 
censorship at an early stage, and the populace was brought into the frenzy of 
joyful debate. They were the first communist planners to realize that 



psychological incentives had to be mobilized if reforms were to really prosper. 
In their April programme they foresaw a stronger role for the State National 
Assembly. Nineteen years later, when Mikhail Gorbachev's spokesman was 
asked what was the difference between the Prague Spring and Gorbachev's 
programme of pere-stroika, he answered 'nineteen years'. The Czechoslovak 
experiment struggled against the odds for barely seven months. At first, it 
seemed that an accommodation could be reached. The Soviet comrades 
expressed concern over alleged excesses, such as the freedom of the media. The 
Czechoslovak Government affirmed its commitment to socialism, its friendship 
for the USSR, and its determination to stay in the Warsaw Pact. Yet in July 
threatening Warsaw Pact manoeuvres were held throughout the country, and a 
personal meeting between Brezhnev and Dubcek and their politburo members 
was held at the frontier village of Cerna-nad-Tisou. After that, the manoeuvres 
were halted and the troops withdrawn. 

At dawn on 21 August 1968, half a million soldiers drawn from all the 
Warsaw Pact countries except Romania poured back into Czechoslovakia 
without warning-Poles alongside grey-uniformed East Germans from the north, 
Hungarians and Bulgarians from the south, Soviet divisions via Poland and 
Ukraine in the east. The surprise and the saturation were overwhelming; 
resistance was minimal. Dubcek was flown to Russia in chains; the reforms were 
halted. Czechoslovakia's frontiers were to be permanently guarded by the 
Warsaw Pact. In due course Dubeek was replaced by Gustav Husak, an old-timer 
who, likeGomulka and Kadar, had kept the faith despite bitter personal 
memories of Stalinism. When it was all over, Brezhnev spelled out the Soviet 
position at a summit meeting of bloc leaders in Warsaw in November 1968. The 
Brezhnev Doctrine stated in the clearest terms that Moscow was obliged by its 
socialist duty to intervene by force to defend the 'socialist gains' of its allies. 
East Berlin (1953), Budapest (1956), and Prague (1968) were all of a piece. 
There had been no fundamental progress. The members of the Soviet bloc were 
not sovereign states. 

The invasion of Czechoslovakia was far less brutal than the suppression of 
the Hungarian Rising. But it unfolded on the world's television screens; and its 
impact on world opinion was enormous. It was condemned by several 
communist Parties. China called it 'barefaced fascist power politics', Yugoslavia 
called it 'illegal occupation', Romania 'a flagrant violation of national 
sovereignty'. It promised an unending ice age in Europe. Few people who heard 
it would forget the crackling voice from the last free broadcast from Radio 



Prague: 'Please remember Czechoslovakia when we are no longer in the news.' 


In the third, Brezhnevian phase (1968-85), the Soviet bloc saw the norms laid 
down by the Brezhnev Doctrine progressively challenged by a growing tide of 
intellectual, social, and eventually political protest. All the levers of power were 
in the hands of the communist authorities; so opposition had to find new, 
nonviolent channels. The principal exemplar of 'normalization' was 
Czechoslovakia. The principal challenger was Poland. 

Czechoslovak normalization was a sorry spectacle indeed. Husak used all the 
petty tyranny of the Party's social controls to destroy the soul of the Prague 
Spring. There were no shootings or show trials, but the despair of the young 
student Jan Palach, who burned himself to death in public, caught the national 
mood. 

Ex-ministers and academics were sent to work in the most menial jobs- 
Dubcek worked as a forestry inspector. Police harassment was universal. Prague, 
Europe's most beautiful city, was also the most depressed. A decade passed 
before a lonely band of dissidents around the playwright Vaclav Havel put their 
names to 'Charter 77'-a declaration of human rights. 

Compartmentalization was a central feature of the Soviet bloc in its later 
stages. Despite continuing lip-service to 'socialist internationalism', the bloc was 
divided up into a series of watertight compartments. National communism 
encouraged conditions where each country, whilst closely connected to Moscow, 
was effectively insulated from the others. The cordon separating Poland from 
Lithuania or Ukraine or, after 1968, from Czechoslovakia was every bit as severe 
as the Iron Curtain itself. The arrest of the Taternicy -a group of athletic 
dissidents backpacking with banned literature over the snowy ridges of the Tatra 
mountains- well illustrated the state of affairs. East Europeans were often more 
familiar with life in Western Europe or the USA than with their immediate 
neighbours. 

The Polish People's Republic (PRL) displayed an unusual number of 
idiosyncrasies. It was the largest of the Soviet satellites, with an army larger than 
that of Great Britain. Both structurally and psychologically it was the least 
sovietized. The Polish peasantry had successfully resisted collectivization; the 
Polish Bar had resisted the communist monopoly; the Polish intelligentsia had 
largely avoided Marxism. The pseudo-pluralism of the Front of National Unity 
permitted a margin of non-Party politics. Most importantly, the Roman Catholic 



Church under its formidable Primate, Stefan Cardinal Wyszyriski (1901-81), 
never submitted, as elsewhere, to political control. By an agreement of 
December 1956 the Church hierarchy was granted full autonomy, so long as 
Party rule was not openly subverted. The calculation of the Party's sociologists 
had presumably been that the rapid modernization which was turning Poland 
into an industrial power would rapidly undermine religion. In fact it was the 
Church which kept the loyalty of the new proletariat, which in turn undermined 
the Party. 

Poland's cycle of opposition and normalization occupied a quarter of a 
century.Gomulka passed rapidly from national hero to crabbed old boss. In the 
mid-1960s he repressed the Marxist intellectuals, in March 1968 the students, in 
1970 bloody workers' protests in the Baltic ports. In 1968 the challenge of an 
ultra-nationalist faction within the Party, whose bid for power had targeted the 
Jewish element in the Party apparatus, grew into a generalized and shameful 
'anti-Zionist campaign', provoking the exodus of almost all of Poland's 
remaining Jews. In the 1970s the ten-year reign of Edward Gierek adopted a 
strategy of bigos communism' funded by excessive Western loans. A brief 
interval of prosperity preceded renewed austerity, mass protests, and, in the 
Workers Defence Committee (KOR), the formation of a consolidated intellectual 
and workers' opposition, the precursor of 'Solidarity'. In June 1979 the visit of a 
Polish Pope created a moral climate pregnant for change. 

The Solidarity trade union grew from a group of determined strikers in the 
Gdansk shipyards in August 1980. It was led by an unknown, unemployed 
electrician on his 'wolf 's ticket', Lech Walesa. It swelled into a nation-wide 
social protest, millions strong. Dedicated to non-violence, it did not fight the 
communists; it simply organized itself without them. The only independent 
organization in the Soviet bloc, it won the formal right to strike and to recruit 
members. Party members defected in droves. Within a year, Solidarity threatened 
to topple the existing order without even trying. From Moscow's viewpoint, it 
had to be suppressed. A non-communist workers' movement was anathema. The 
ailing Brezhnev put the Soviet Army on alert, then left the job to the Polish 
army. On the night of 13 December 1981, aided by deep snow, General Wojciech 
Jaruzelski executed the most perfect military coup in modern European history. 
In a few hours, 40-50,000 Solidarity activists were arrested; all communications 
were cut and military commissars took over all major institutions. Martial law 
paralysed the country. In 1982, having imposed stability, Jaruzelski introduced 
the first stage of economic reform. The victory of communist 'normalization' 



appeared complete. In reality, it was the hollowest of victories. Within seven 
years, Jaruzelski would be at the end of his tether. History must give the Poles 
the principal credit for bringing the Soviet bloc to its knees. 

Despite appearances, Jaruzelski's emergence in Poland could later be seen as the 
first emanation of a reforming trend that was about to break surface in Moscow 
itself. This trend, which in due course would acquire the Russian name of 
perestroika or 'restructuring', was founded on the realization that the system was 
profoundly sick. Significantly, it came out of the KGB, the only body which had 
the means to know what was really happening. Jaruzelski had served for 25 
years as head of the Polish army's military-political department. He was 
necessarily a client of the man who ran the KGB throughout the 1970s. He was 
'playing John the Baptist' to Andropov's other protege, Mikhail Gorbachev. 
With Gorbachev's collusion, he was destined to turn Poland into 'the laboratory 
of perestroika. 

By the early 1980s the internal operations of the Soviet bloc were no longer 
achieving their goals. Forty years of corrosion had sapped their strength. On the 
surface, everything was in place; underneath, little was working well. In the age 
of the inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM), the territory of the Warsaw Pact 
could no longer serve as an effective security buffer. In the age of high oil prices, 
the CMEA was draining more from the USSR than it was putting in. In the age 
of television, the gulf in living conditions between East and West was evident in 
every home. As Solidarity showed, the workers had no respect for the 'workers' 
state'. Important sectors of the Communist elite were losing the will to rule. One 
of Jaruzelski's closest aides had chosen the patriotic course of feeding the CIA 
over a decade with the biggest flood of operational documents from the Warsaw 
Pact in the history of espionage.- 

It is the career of Yuri Andropov, however, which provides the key to the 
extraordinary change of direction which preceded and then precipitated the 
collapse of the Soviet system. As ambassador in Budapest, Andropov had been 
co-author of the strategy of substituting economic for political reform. As head 
of the international department of the CPSU he must have known that the costly 
revolts which had beset Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and now Poland could spread 
to the Soviet Union. As head of the KGB during the era of detente (see p. 1115), 
he was the person best placed to see the glaring contrast between external 
strength and internal decay. In the 1970s Andropov had waged a cunning and 


flexible campaign of persecution against Soviet dissenters. He had no need to 
use mass terror; instead, he curtailed their access to the population at large, 
whilst consigning the obdurate to psychiatric hospitals or to foreign exile. He 
countered the growing disaffection of Soviet Jewry by giving them preferential 
access to emigration. As the files passed over his desk, he could only have 
wondered why the finest talents in the land had no love for communism. The list 
was a long one: Solzhenitsyn the political novelist, Nureyev the dancer, 
Rostropovich the cellist, Sakharov the physicist, the indomitable Bukovsky, a 
biologist, Andrei Amalrik, the mathematician who had written, after Orwell, Will 
the Soviet Union Survive until 1984? These people must necessarily have figured 
prominently in Andropov's long talks with the bright young Party Secretary 
from Stavropol who attended him at the nearby spa where he stayed to treat his 
kidneys. 

Andropov's penchant for reform, however, was repeatedly baulked. The 
Soviet Politburo was packed with guardians of the status quo. Gorbachev was 
brought in from Stavropol in 1979 only to be given the thankless task of running 
Soviet agriculture. Andropov did not reach the top until his own terminal illness 
was upon him. His death gave the Brezhnevites a final lease of inaction. Despite 
Amalrik's prediction, 1984 came and went; the Soviet Empire survived 
unreformed. 

East-West Relations: The Cold War in Europe, 1948- 
1989 

From start to finish, the Cold War was focused on Europe. Its dynamic 
developed from the collapse of the 'Great Triangle' of European Powers, which 
had left the victorious Western Allies face to face with a victorious Soviet Union 
(see p. 1312). It grew from the inability of the wartime allies to reach agreement 
on the independence of Poland, on the future of Germany, and on the division of 
Europe as a whole. There can be some debate as to when exactly it began; but it 
came to a head through the American commitment to Europe, as expressed in the 
Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan of 1947, and through subsequent 
expressions of Soviet disapproval. It was clearly in progress during the Soviet 
blockade of Berlin in 1948-9 which led to the formation of NATO; and it did not 
end until the Iron Curtain in Europe was breached 40 years later. None the less, 
it is important to stress that the Cold War soon overreached its European focus. 



There was always an Asian component; and there was a strong inner logic 
resulting from Soviet-American rivalry which turned it into a truly global 
confrontation. 

The Asian component developed over disagreements parallel to those that 
occurred in Europe. In this case the Soviet Union entered the scene in August 
1945, when the Soviet army was thrown into the final campaign of the Pacific 
War against Japan. The Yalta Agreement had made provision for the Soviets to 
occupy the Kurile Islands as the price for Stalin's participation. But no one at 
Yalta had foreseen the sudden and total collapse of Japan, brought about by the 
US atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In the event, the Soviets 
were given an altogether unexpected bonus. They rapidly occupied Manchuria, 
whence they carried off 600,000 men of the Kwantung army into the Siberian 
camps. In addition to the main Kurile chain, they seized four northern Japanese 
islands, hitherto regarded as part of Hokkaido, renamed them the 'Lesser 
Kuriles', and turned the Sea of Okhotsk into a strategic Soviet lake. What is 
more, they openly championed the cause of communist revolutionaries in China 
and Korea, to which they now had direct access. In China, they were taking sides 
against America's longstanding client, Chiang Kai-shek, who had been part of 
the Grand Alliance throughout the war with Japan. By the time that Mao Zedong 
entered Beijing in 1949, a 'Bamboo Curtain' was rising in the Far East to match 
the Iron Curtain in Europe. 

The globalization of the Cold War took place in the course of the 1950s. In 
its geopolitical aspect, this was the natural outcome of a confrontation that pitted 
one power which dominated the land mass of Eurasia against another which 
could project land, sea, and air forces to all parts of the world. In its political, 
economic, and ideological aspects it reflected the rivalry of one bloc with 
pretensions to the worldwide patronage of communist-led revolution and another 
wedded to democracy, capitalism, and free trade. It was fuelled by the 
contemporary process of decolonization, which left a string of unstable, ex¬ 
colonial countries open to wars by proxy, and where, as in the oil-rich Middle 
East, valuable resources presented irresistible temptations. It was finalized in the 
late 1950s by the invention of ICBMs, which put the whole earth within the 
range of constant surveillance and instant nuclear attack. Henceforth, the cities 
of the Russian and American heartlands found themselves in the front line no 
less than Taiwan or Berlin. 

In the military field, the Cold War passed through several distinct phases. In 



the 1950s, when the USA held a decisive lead both in its nuclear arsenal and in 
the means of airborne delivery, the Soviets could not risk a major clash. At the 
Moscow meeting in January 1951, whilst the Americans were tied down in 
Korea, the leaders of the Soviet bloc were apparently given orders by Stalin to 
prepare for the Third World War. But the plans were never put into effect.- First 
Britain (1952) then France (1960) developed independent nuclear capacity; and 
NATO professed a doctrine of 'overwhelming retaliation'. Two communist 
proxy wars were fought-one against an American-led UN force in Korea in 
1950-1, the other in Indo-China, where defeated French troops gave way to the 
Americans in 1954. Europe, though bristling with weapons in two armed camps, 
did not erupt. 

In the late 1950s the game changed. Thanks to the Sputnik (1958) and the U2 
incident (1960),the Kremlin was able to demonstrate that its rocketry had more 
than closed the technological gap. The superpowers poured vast resources into 
the 'Space Race' and into the deployment of earth satellites and ICBMs. 
Although the USA won the competition to put a man on the moon, there was no 
certainty where the true military advantage lay. The USSR seemed to be building 
a remorseless superiority in nuclear, conventional, and naval forces. But the 
advent of 'tactical' and later of 'battlefield' nuclear weapons, coupled with 
NATO's new doctrine of 'flexible response', rendered any purely quantitative 
calculations redundant. Pressure on the European theatre was somewhat relieved 
by the knowledge that the main exchange of ICBMs, if it happened, would be 
directed over the North Pole. Stalemate was reached at maximal levels of 
military spending. The offensive doctrines adopted by the Warsaw Pact were not 
put into practice; the vastly expanded Soviet Fleet was not put to the test; 
massive rearmament proceeded alongside repeated and much feebler attempts at 
disarmament. But once again the European conflict stayed cold. 

In the 1980s another turn of the screw was reached with the deployment of a 
more deadly generation of weapons, notably Soviet SS-20S, and American 
Pershing 2 and Cruise missiles. In 1983 President Reagan's announcement of the 
multi-billion-dollar Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI), commonly known as 
'Star Wars'-a space-based anti-ICBM defence system-openly challenged 
Moscow to a race that simply could not be run. Each side possessed the 
kilotonnes to destroy the planet many times over; neither side could possibly use 
them. Advocates of the nuclear deterrent believed strongly that their point was 
being made. Their opponents-who could only speak fieely in the West- 
believed with equal passion that the military planners, like Dr Strangelove, had 


gone mad. But the Pax atomica held. 

With some slight delay, the political rhythms of the Cold War usually 
followed military developments. Tensions were highest in the late 1950s, since 
both sides could pursue their cause with convictions unsullied by failure. They 
reached their peak in the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962. In the 1960s, 
despite numerous alarms, both sides lost their expectations of a simple victory. 
International communism was all but paralysed by the Sino-Soviet split which in 
1969 came close to a pre-emptive nuclear strike against Beijing; the mighty USA 
was immensely disheartened by its inability to coerce the diminutive state of 
Vietnam; and NATO was profoundly disrupted by de Gaulle. In the 1970s, 
therefore, both Soviets and Americans felt sufficiently contrite to give greater 
emphasis to the process that was cleverly labelled detente. The initial Strategic 
Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) at Vienna were soon joined by political 
discussions leading to the Helsinki Final Act of 1975. In the 1980s tensions rose 
again after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (1979)-the Kremlin's Vietnam- 
and the declaration of martial law in Poland (1981). At all stages, in fact, one 
could observe a subtle mixture of threats and relaxations. There were early 
moments of detente in the coldest years of confrontation, and frigid intervals in 
the so-called era of detente. Certainly in Europe, where no open warfare 
occurred in four decades, it is probably less accurate to talk of the Cold War 
than, in a French commentator's phrase, of the 'Hot Peace'. It was a fever which 
rose and fell many times. 

Economic relations could never reach their potential levels. The West was 
reluctant to sell advanced technology of military value. The American COCOM 
list grew to contain many thousands of forbidden commercial items. The East, 
for its part, believed strongly in economic self-sufficiency, preferring 
backwardness to dependence on capitalist imports. By the late 1970s Soviet 
harvest failures regularly caused panic purchases of vast quantities of US grain, 
whilst 50 per cent of Soviet oil production was earmarked for loss-making trade 
within the CMEA. 

Cultural relations remained conservative in scale and content. Tours by the 
Bolshoi Ballet and the Red Army Choir, or the Mazowsze folk dance ensemble, 
were exchanged for visits by various western orchestras or the Royal 
Shakespeare Company. The Soviet bloc countries set great store by the Olympic 
Games, where their state-sponsored athletes performed very well. Sport was 
used as a political instrument, most openly by the US boycott of the Moscow 



Games in 1980, and Soviet retaliation at Los Angeles in 1984. 

Diplomatic relations were beset by obstacles of all sorts. The Security 
Council of the UN was paralysed for 40 years, most frequently by the Soviet 
veto. The war of spies reached grotesque proportions: Western intelligence was 
penetrated at the highest levels by Soviet recruits in Britain, and by East German 
agents in Bonn. In the 1950s, in the era of Senator Joseph McCarthy, reasonable 
fears about the activities of communist agents in the USA caused a totally 
unreasonable witch-hunt. Successive American embassies in Moscow were so 
riddled with bugging devices that they had to be abandoned. There was no trust. 

The origins of detente go right back to the start of the Cold War. Stalin once 
offered to permit the reunification of Germany in return for American 
disengagement. At the Geneva meeting in 1955 when President Eisenhower met 
Stalin's successors, the West was surprised again by far-reaching Soviet 
proposals for disarmament. 1959 saw Khrushchev at Camp David, and 
Macmillan, in Cossack hat, in Moscow. But the developing dialogue was 
withered by the U2 incident, by the second Berlin crisis, and, most severely, by 
the discovery of Soviet missiles in Cuba. 

The U2 was a high-altitude American spy-plane, supposedly immune to 
attack. In 1960 a flight from Turkey was shot down over the Volga. Eisenhower 
was foolish enough to deny the existence of ah such operations until Khrushchev 
produced the pilot and the damning evidence of his duties. 

The Berlin crisis of 1961 had been brewing for years. The stream of refugees 
from East to West was gathering pace. Ten thousand crossed in the last week of 
July 1961 alone. The Kremlin had repeatedly threatened to sign a unilateral 
treaty with the DDR, and to terminate the rights of four-power occupation. The 
Soviets held overwhelming local military superiority. But the West made no 
move. Then, on 13 August 1961, the Wall was built. The young President 
Kennedy was being tested as never before. Privately relieved that the Wall had 
lessened the chances of a second Berlin blockade, he did not react militarily; 
instead, he staged a propaganda coup. Standing beside the Wall, he shouted 
defiantly in his inimitable Boston drawl, Tch bin ein Berliner'. 

The Cuban crisis of the following October brought the Cold War to the brink. 
Kennedy had come out of the Berlin crisis, and his earlier meeting with 
Khrushchev in Vienna, convinced of his failure to impress Moscow with 
America's determination. Next time, he had to give proof of firmness. He 


increased US commitments to South Vietnam. When aerial photography 
revealed the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuban silos only 90 miles off the 
coast of Florida, he decided that the Kremlin must be forced to back down. The 
only question was how. Washington rejected a surgical air strike in favour of 
putting Cuba into quarantine. For a week the world held its breath; then the 
Soviet missiles were withdrawn. The USA undertook to withdraw its own 
missiles from Turkey, and refrain from invading Cuba.- 

Disarmament talks dragged on for decades. The Geneva offer foundered over 
Soviet refusals to allow inspection. In 1963 the Moscow Agreement banned 
nuclear testing in the atmosphere, but only after enormous damage had been 
caused to the global environment. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968 
was designed to maintain the monopoly of the five existing nuclear powers and, 
in particular, to exclude China. It failed on all counts, except as a temporary 
brake. The first round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT I) reached an 
interim conclusion in 1972 after four years. SALT II ground along until blocked 
by the US Congress in 1980. The further stage of trying to negotiate an absolute 
reduction in the size of military arsenals, as opposed to limiting their rate of 
increase, proceeded from the mid-1970s onwards. Talks on Mutual Balanced 
Force Reduction (MBFR), concerning conventional armaments, were located in 
Vienna for fifteen years. The Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START), 
concerning nuclear weapons, were located in Madrid from 1982. Thirty years of 
intergovernmental talking proved as impotent as the series of popular campaigns 
against nuclear weapons which attracted considerable support in the West in the 
early 1960s, and again in the early 1980s. 

Direct European involvement in Cold War diplomacy inevitably took second 
place to the main US-Soviet confrontation. But it gradually asserted itself from 
the mid-1950s onwards. In 1957, with Soviet agreement, Poland presented the 
UN with the Rapacki Plan for a nuclear-free zone in central Europe, and in 1960 
the Gomulka Plan for a nuclear freeze in the same area. Nothing much ensued. 
In 1965 the Polish Catholic bishops published an open letter to their counterparts 
in Germany, stating their readiness £ to forgive and to be forgiven'. This 
courageous initiative, denounced as traitorous by the communist governments, 
pointed a clear way forward through the moral fog of fear and hatred. 

Soviet policy in Eastern Europe played heavily on the German bogey, and 
communist propaganda made huge efforts to keep wartime germanophobia alive. 


In West Germany the strident voice of the expellees carried considerable weight 
with Christian Democrat governments; and the unregulated fate of their Eastern 
homelands only served to keep passions simmering. The prevailing political 
climate only began to thaw in the late 1960s, largely through the good offices of 
the German Churches, who thereby prepared the way for the Ostpolitik of 
Chancellor Willy Brandt. 

The Ostpolitik or 'Eastern Policy', launched in 1969, was based on 
consistent short-term, mid-term, and long-term objectives. In the immediate 
situation, Brandt sought to break the deadlock in East-West relations which had 
set in after the invasion of Czechoslovakia. Ever since the full recognition of the 
Federal Republic, West Germany had pursued the so-called Hallstein Doctrine, 
refusing to deal with any government (except the USSR) which dealt with the 
DDR. The result had been almost total isolation from all of Germany's Eastern 
neighbours. After breaking the ice, Brandt then sought to establish a modus 
vivendi with the DDR, and with other members of the Soviet bloc. Over 10,20, 
or perhaps 30 years, he hoped that growing intercourse between Western and 
Eastern Germany would soften the regime in East Berlin, and lead to eventual 
reconciliation. On the first two scores the Ostpolitik undoubtedly gained its 
objectives. On the third it had the opposite effect from that intended. Indeed, it is 
not certain that Brandt ever really expected Germany to be reunited. During his 
retirement, he admitted: 'Reunification is the lie of German political life.' 

None the less, Willy Brandt's appearance on the international scene had a 
very considerable impact. Eastern Europe had not been conditioned to the idea 
of a German Chancellor who was a socialist with manifestly peaceful intentions. 
Born the illegitimate son of a Liibeck salesgirl, Brandt (Herbert Frahm, 1913- 
92) overcame every possible social disadvantage. Having lived in Norway 
during the war, and fought the Nazis, he had impeccable democratic credentials. 
What is more, as the Mayor of West Berlin from 1957 to 1963, he had gained a 
reputation for staunch resistance to communism. When he appeared in Moscow 
in August 1970, therefore, 25 years after the defeat of the Wehrmacht, he made a 
great impression. That December in Poland, where he fell to his knees before the 
memorial to the fighters of the Warsaw Ghetto, he made an emotional gesture 
that was long remembered. In East Berlin, his overtures could not be resisted. 
Within three years, he had forged a German-Soviet Treaty of Co-operation 
(1970), a German-Polish Treaty (1970) which drew the sting of Germany's lost 
territories, and in 1973 a treaty of mutual recognition with the DDR. The Iron 
Curtain and the Berlin Wall were not breached; indeed, they were given a new 



lease of life. The German problem had not been solved; but it had been fixed in a 
stable framework of minimal intercourse. Brandt's conservative opponents 
accused him of giving away Germany's birthright. 'One cannot give away 
something which has already been gambled away,' was his reply. 

Historians will always debate whether West Germany's Ostpolitik served to 
prolong the division of Europe or whether, through humiliating compromise, it 
set the course which eventually led to reunification. The two interpretations are 
not, in fact, exclusive. It certainly set the tone for the next decade. By ending the 
boycott of the DDR, it involved the Federal Government in a great deal of 
expense with no visible return, and a large number of shady operations-such as 
the scandalous trade in political prisoners, which East Berlin sold off for royal 
ransoms. By defusing the threat-laden atmosphere of the late 1960s, it opened 
the way for 'the era of detente'. 

Detente is a diplomatic term of the choicest ambiguity. For those who so wish, it 
can mean 'relaxation' or 'a mild spell of weather'. It is also the French word for 
the trigger of a gun. In the context of the 1970s it obviously signified the release 
of pressure; but whether that release was to have a benign or a deadly effect was 
entirely open to conjecture. 

Apart from Bonn's Ostpolitik and the progress of SAFT I, an important spur 
to detente must be found in distant China. In 1972 the American President, 
Richard Nixon, visited the ageing Chairman Mao, thereby 'playing the China 
card'. The bipolar structure of the Cold War was transformed into a new, 
triangular configuration made up of the Soviet bloc, China, and the West. The 
Soviet leaders, resigned to an uneasy stalemate with Beijing, felt constrained to 
stabilize their position in Europe. After all, 30 years after the triumph of 
Stalingrad the Soviet Union was still having to live without a formal settlement 
on its Western flank. Discussions started in 1970 and culminated in the Helsinki 
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), which ran on from 
1973 to 1975. 

From the Soviet viewpoint, the Helsinki Final Act took the place of the 
German Peace Treaty that never was. From the Western viewpoint, it marked a 
recognition that Soviet dominance of Eastern Europe could not be ended by 
force, and a decision to make the Soviets buy stability at a high political price. 
Basket One of the negotiations, on security issues, ended with an agreement to 
guarantee Europe's existing frontiers, except for peaceful changes by mutual 



consent. Basket Two contained measures for extending economic co-operation. 
Basket Three contained an agreement to promote a wide range of cultural and 
communication projects, and to guarantee human contacts. This was the political 
price-tag. From the day that the Final Act was signed in 1975, the regimes of the 
East had to choose between respecting their citizens' rights or being exposed for 
breaking their solemn undertakings. 

The Helsinki Final Act was criticized by many as a capitulation to the Soviet 
conquest of Eastern Europe. At the same time, it gave formal encouragement to 
political dissent throughout the Soviet bloc. In Poland, it gave an early boost to 
KOR, the predecessor of Solidarity; in Czechoslovakia, to the Charter 77 group 
led by Vaclav Havel; and in the Soviet Union, to numerous 'Helsinki Watch 
Committees'. It was totally ignored by Andropov's KGB; but it was taken very 
seriously by the American administration of President Carter, who, in view of 
constant Soviet violations, saw no reason to disengage from Europe. 

At the end of the 1970s three new faces appeared in the West. In 1978 a Slavonic 
Pope ascended the throne of St Peter, endowed with a vision of reuniting 
Christian Europe. In 1979 a woman of great fortitude moved into 10 Downing 
Street. She was soon to be dubbed, by the Kremlin, The Iron Lady'. In 1980 a 
retired film actor entered the Oval Office of the White House. The 'Great 
Communicator' was soon to call the Soviet Union The evil empire'. These three 
personalities breathed a new spirit into East-West relations. All three opposed 
communism on moral principle; all three were hugely popular in Eastern Europe 
-more so than in the West; all three looked unhappy with the accommodations 
of the previous decades. Reagan and Thatcher honed the twin-track policy of 
NATO, which held out the palm of peace whilst strengthening its military shield. 

By the 1980s, hard experience had shown that the West had been suffering 
from three persistent illusions. It had been the vogue among political scientists to 
talk of 'convergence'-the idea that time would draw the political and economic 
systems of East and West closer together. This was pure make-believe. The gap 
was widening with every day that passed. It had also been judged appropriate to 
'differentiate' between communist regimes according to their degree of 
subservience to Moscow. This policy had given the greatest favours to the most 
repressive of regimes, like that of Ceausescu. Detente had fostered a hypothesis 
that has been called 'ornithological'. The conduct of the communists, it was 
argued, was dependent on the good conduct of the West. Beastly comments in 



Western capitals would only encourage the 'hawks'; kindness would encourage 
the 'doves'. In practice, no such pattern emerged. No one had been subjected to 
such harsh words as Jaruzelski, yet he turned to reform. No one was offered so 
many sweeteners as Honecker-and Honecker remained as hawkish as ever. The 
fact is, the communists did not respond to kindness. As one of the earliest critics 
of detente had argued in his Theses on Hope and Hopelessness, raising the 
tension of East-West relations was a dangerous ploy; but it was the only strategy 
which held out a promise of ultimate success.- 

In the midst of these divided counsels there appeared a new star in the East. In 
March 1985 Mikhail Sergeevich Gorbachev (b. 1931) emerged as the fourth 
General Secretary of the CPSU in three years. He was chosen by the Party 
apparatus, and had no democratic credentials. Yet, as a person, he was 
completely different; and he was the first Soviet leader to be untainted by a 
Stalinist record. He was affable, quick-witted, and spoke without notes. Here at 
last was a man, as Mrs Thatcher was quick to announce, 'with whom we can do 
business'. 

Gorbachev's early months in office were taken up by reshufflings of the 
Politburo, by the ritual denunciation of previous leaders, and by an ominous 
campaign against cormption. But the style had obviously changed. The world 
waited to see if the content would change with it. Foreign policy offered a Soviet 
leader the most room for manoeuvre. It was reasonable to assume, if Gorbachev 
moved, that he would first make a move on East-West relations. 

The initial meetings between Gorbachev and Reagan were not specially 
productive. The newcomer was taking the old 'Star Warrior's' measure. But the 
burden of military spending was no secret; long preparations for a treaty on the 
reduction of Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) preceded the summit 
scheduled at Reykjavik, Iceland, for December 1987. Suddenly, in the middle of 
the talks at Reykjavik, Gorbachev struck without warning. He proposed a 
sensational 50 per cent cut in all nuclear weapons. Reagan reeled, recoiled, and 
regretted. The INF was signed; but the ultra-cautious, ultra-suspicious 
encounters of the past were over. This General Secretary seemed intent on 
stopping the Cold War in its tracks. 

Shortly afterwards, an extraordinary incident served to puncture the balloon 
of East-West tensions. Air defence had been the burning military issue of the 
decade: it was the issue behind Cruise, and behind Star Wars itself, and it was 


costing multi-billions. Each side was terrified that the missiles and bombers of 
the other would find their target without response. The Soviet Union had 
attracted enormous opprobrium for building an unauthorized anti-IBM radar 
station at Krasnoyarsk, and for shooting down a South Korean passenger flight, 
KAL 007, which had strayed into Soviet air space. Yet all the expert anxieties of 
the world's military planners were cut down to size by the prank of a German 
schoolboy. On 28 May 1987,19-year-old Matthias Rust piloted a tiny private 
monoplane up the Baltic from Hamburg, crossed the Soviet frontier in Latvia, 
flew at treetop level under the most concentrated air defences in the world, and 
landed on the cobblestones near Moscow's Red Square. Single-handed, he made 
the whole Cold War look ridiculous. 

By the time of the Malta Summit in December 1989, Presidents Bush and 
Gorbachev felt free to announce that the Cold War had ended. 

Integration and Disintegration, 1985-1991 

For two or three years after Gorbachev's appearance, the main contours of 
Europe's political landscape remained untouched. In Western Europe the 
American presence was still a determining factor; and the horizons of the EEC 
were still confined to the economic sphere. In Eastern Europe people were still 
being shot for trying to cross the Iron Curtain. All the old immovables still held 
office-Honecker, Husak, Kadar, Ceausescu, Zhivkov, Hoxha. The 'Other 
Europe' was still 'the last colonial empire in existence'.- Even Gorbachev 
maintained a granite exterior. In November 1987 he presided over the 70th 
anniversary celebrations of the Bolshevik Revolution in traditional style. As late 
as May 1988 he was promoting the Orthodox millennium in Kiev in a spirit of 
Russian nationalism of which Stalin himself would have approved. 

Yet Europe, both East and West, was fast approaching the brink of 
unforeseen transformations. As the clouds of the Cold War lifted, new, exciting 
vistas could be glimpsed on many fronts. Within two years of Gorbachev's 
disarmament offensive at Reykjavik, the Soviet Union had relinquished its grip 
on its satellites. Within three years, political union was moving up the agenda in 
Western Europe. Within four years, the Soviet Union itself evaporated. As 
Western Europe integrated, Eastern Europe disintegrated. 

No single individual, or individuals, can claim the credit for upheavals on 
such a scale. But two men found themselves promoted to positions at the centre 


of the swirling tides. One was Gorbachev; the other was the new President of the 
European Commission, Jacques Delors. Their enemies would say that both 
lacked a sense of realism-the reformer in pursuit of the unreformable, the 
integrator in charge of the unintegratable. 

Jacques Delors (b. 1925), formerly French Finance Minister, presented the 
outward appearance of an archetypal technocrat. Born in Paris, he was at once a 
practising Catholic and a socialist, but had never visited the USA. But he was 
also a man with a mission, a true disciple of Monnet and Schuman, whose wider 
vision had lain dormant for 30 years. His opponents called him a Euro¬ 
fundamentalist. 'Europe will not be built at a stroke or according to a single 
plan,' Schuman had once remarked; 'it will be built through concrete 
achievements.' This summed up the Delors approach exactly. The principal 
instrument for his ambitions was the Single European Act (SEA). Two terms of 
office, 1985-9 and 1989-92, would be sufficient to see it through from 
conception to realization. 

In the formal sense, the Single European Act could be regarded as nothing 
more than the contents of its text-an elaborate programme for the total 
abolition of barriers to trade and mobility within the EEC. As presented in 1985 
and adopted by member states in 1986, its 282 chapters set out a long list of 
humdrum measures which would lead to a single unified market of 320 million 
customers by the end of 1992. It envisaged the removal of internal frontiers, free 
business competition, the standardization of consumer protection, the 
equalization of living standards, the mutual recognition of professional 
qualifications, the harmonization of VAT and other indirect taxes, and unified 
guidelines for television, broadcasting, and telecommunications. Article 148 
introduced the principle of qualified majority voting in the executive Council of 
Ministers. Members' votes were to be weighted in the ratio of West Germany, 
France, Italy, and Britain (10 each), Spain (8), Belgium, Netherlands, Greece, 
Portugal (5 each), Denmark and Ireland (3 each), and Luxemburg (2). An 
effective majority was to require 54 of the 72 votes, or 75 per cent. 

However, it was not hard to foresee that the SEA could be used as the Trojan 
Horse for more comprehensive plans. Once launched, there was every 
opportunity to argue that the single market could not be made viable without the 
abolition of still more barriers. This is indeed what happened: a chain reaction of 
demands set in for further financial, political, legal, and social integration. After 
two decades of very modest advance, the tempo of the EEC was quickening: the 



catch-word in Brussels was 'ga bouge' (it's moving). In 1987, as a sign of the 
times, the Community officially adopted the flag of the Council of Europe. 
Twelve golden stars on a deep blue ground no longer symbolized the starry 
ideals of Strasbourg. They now stood for the twelve member states in an 
expandable circle of perfect union. 

The European Commission issued a growing flood of directives. Taken 
separately, these directives often looked petty. One concerning the obligatory 
dimensions of the European condom (whose size the Italian Government 
apparently sought to reduce) was not the sole butt of ribaldry. Taken together, 
they formed an avalanche moving in a consistent direction. After the Council's 
acceptance of the free movement of capital, in June 1988 the Commission issued 
a directive for reviving the process of Economic and Monetary Union. 

When the Commission's intentions became apparent, its critics pressed the 
alarm button. Margaret Thatcher had accepted 'Project 1992' with reluctance. In 
a speech to the College of Europe in Bruges on 20 September 1988, she now 
attacked the prospect of a 'European superstate', and of 'an identikit European 
personality' with passion. On another occasion her strident protests of 'No! No! 
No!' recalled de Gaulle's performances 20 years before. She won the sympathy 
both of the 'Little Englanders' and of conservative Americans who feared the 
growth of an anti-American 'Fortress Europe'. But she misjudged the mood of 
her own Party, which removed her in a 'Cabinet Coup' in November 1990. 

At this point the tide seemed to be turning fast in the Commission's favour. 
The disintegration of the Soviet bloc was transforming the political and 
economic landscape. German reunification led to unease (not least in Germany 
itself) about Germany's disproportionate influence. With no common policy, 
there was a danger that Europe as a whole would begin to drift. 

In this climate, yet another wave of initiatives swept the Community. A 
Belgian memorandum of March 1990 set out the fourfold objectives of 
Subsidiarity, Democracy, Efficiency, and Coherence. A month later, a Franco- 
German letter raised the issues of common foreign, security, justice, and police 
policies. At that year's Madrid summit, Delors spoke of 'an embryo European 
Government' within five years. The further enlargement of the Community, and 
the strengthening both of the European Parliament and of European security, all 
reached the agenda. Enlargement plans were directed at several categories of 
entrant. By 1991 the Community was proposing to admit the remaining EFTA 
countries to the Common Market (though not yet to full membership), to grant 



associate status to three post-communist states, and to finalize the admission of 
Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway within three years. Applications for full 
or associate status were pending from a number of extra-European states such as 
Turkey and Israel. The Twelve stood fair to become the Twenty or even the 
Thirty. 

One reason why the member states welcomed the Commission's initiative 
lay in their understanding of the principle of subsidiarity. This principle, 
borrowed from the practices of Catholic Canon Law, stated that the central 
organs of the Community should only be concerned with the most essential areas 
of policy, leaving everything else to 'subsidiary levels of government'. National 
governments were eager to insist that everything else was going to be left to 
them. But subsidiarity, if extended, could also be used to link Brussels directly 
with regional or local authorities, and to bypass the national level of government. 
Definitions were urgently required. 

The more rigorous advocates of political union made no secret of their 
dislike of the nation-state. In addition to all its historic sins, the nation-state was 
now seen to be 'too small to cope with the big issues, and too big to cope with 
the small ones'. There was some reason to fear that the Community might be 
turned, like the UN, into a club of governments. It was certainly consistent to 
argue that European democracy could not progress until the Community's own 
Parliament was upgraded against the separate assemblies of member states. 

It was in this context that debates about the 'regions' of Europe came to the 
fore. Any strengthening of the central organs of the Community automatically 
encouraged centrifugal tendencies within the member states. The rise of Brussels 
was bound to be followed by the rise of Edinburgh, of Milan, of Barcelona, and 
of Antwerp. Regional interests could be identified both within and between 
member states. Within the decentralized Federal Republic of Germany, for 
instance, the governments of the Lander enjoyed far-reaching autonomy. France, 
too, once the bastion of centralism, had recently strengthened the competence of 
its 22 regions. (In Britain, by contrast, where regional 'devolution' had been 
rebuffed and local government diminished, the opposite trend prevailed.) The 
concept of 'Euroregions' came into being to bridge the gap between the 
Community and its Eastern neighbours. Italy mooted the creation of a 
'Pentagonale' of five countries in the Adriatic hinterland; Germany, Poland, and 
the Scandinavian countries discussed the possibility of future regions of co¬ 
operation on either side of the Baltic. 



Political uncertainties strengthened centrifugal pressures within member 
states. In Spain, the long-standing discontents of Catalans and Basques were 
controlled but not fully satisfied. In Italy, a Lombard League was reborn with the 
aim of 'liberating' the north from the burdens of the Mezzogiorno. In Britain, the 
Scottish Nationalists were drawing their second wind: an independent Scotland 
looked a better risk inside the European Community than outside it. 

In practice, though, everything remained to be played for. The Community 
was still debating whether it should be geographically enlarged before it was 
constitutionally 'deepened'. Delors preferred 'Deepen first, enlarge later'. His 
critics thought this a ruse for keeping the community small, Western, and 
controlled by the Commission. Even so, by the time that the leaders of the 
Twelve were due to meet at Maastricht in Limburg in December 1991, the 
momentum was still accelerating. To this end, the Commission was preparing to 
present a massive Treaty on European Union designed to amend and expand the 
Treaty of Rome. The 61,351 words of its text were to mark 'a new stage in the 
process of European integration'. It mapped out pathways towards 'economic 
and monetary union', 'a single and stable currency', a 'common citizenship', and 
'a common foreign and security policy'.- But it said nothing about enlargement, 
nothing about the transformation of Europe as a whole. Conceived by a 
Commission still preoccupied with purely Western concerns, Maastricht in no 
way prepared Europe for the avalanche that was about to break in the other half 
of the Continent. 

Meanwhile, as Delors flourished, Gorbachev flashed, floundered, and flopped. 
His analysis of the Soviet crisis can be deduced from his subsequent actions. 
Much of it was explicitly stated in his book, Perestroika (1989). It was a sorry 
catalogue. Further expansion of the Soviet arsenal did not promise greater 
security. Military spending had reached levels which precluded any 
improvement in civilian living standards. Indeed, the Soviet economy could no 
longer sustain established patterns of expenditure. Communist planning methods 
had failed, the technology gap with the West was widening every day. The Party 
was corrupt and dispirited; the young were turning their backs on communist 
ideology; the citizenry had lost patience with empty promises. Soviet society 
was beset by apathy. Soviet foreign policy was in disarray. The war in 
Afghanistan, like all the other revolutionary struggles, was a bottomless drain; 
Soviet hegemony in Eastern Europe paid no dividends. Gorbachev's strategy lay 


first in defusing the Cold War climate of fear and hatred on which the old system 
had thrived, and then, having cleared the air, to move on to the trickier problems 
of internal reform. On the external front he was brilliantly successful. On visits 
to the USA and to West Germany, he was hailed as a conquering hero. 
Gorbymania raged. Notwithstanding his continuing support for traditional 
communist subversion in Western countries, he was eager to welcome President 
Reagan to Moscow. 

Gorbachev's internal policies were encapsulated in two programmatic 
buzzwords that went round the world. Perestroika, 'restructuring', envisaged the 
injection of market principles into economic management and of non-Party 
interests into political life. Glasnost' was wrongly translated as 'openness'. It 
was, in fact, a standard Russian word for 'publicity', the opposite of 'silence' or 
'taboo'. It was initially intended as a goad for the Party comrades to propose 
solutions to problems whose very existence had hitherto been denied. Gorbachev 
set out to stimulate debate; and for this, it was essential that outspoken views 
should not be punished. So the Party began to talk, and then the media, and 
eventually the public. For the first time in their lives, Soviet people found that 
censorship and the police were not going to be used against them. With some 
delay, therefore, Glasnost' did turn into openness, in an unprecedented, 
unrestrained, unstoppable torrent of argument. The strongest stream within that 
torrent was the near-universal denunciation of communism. 

Very soon, therefore, General Secretary Gorbachev found himself in an 
anomalous position. In spite of his liberal reputation in the West, he was a 
convinced communist who wanted to humanize and revitalize the system, not to 
dump it. He stood for 'democratization', not democracy. Like Brezhnev before 
him, he arranged to be given the office of state 'President'-as if he were the 
equivalent of the American President. Yet he never faced the electorate, and 
never sought to relinquish his main, unelected office of Party leader. His six 
years of reform, therefore, could never proceed beyond half- or quarter- 
measures. He supplemented the central Party organs with a new Congress of 
hand-picked People's Deputies; but he never granted free elections. In the 
economic sphere he toyed repeatedly with marketization, but rejected all the 
more radical plans. He refused to decollectivize agriculture or to desubsidize 
prices; he delayed the legalization of private property. As a result, the planned 
economy started to collapse in conditions where the market economy could not 
start to function. On the nationality issue, he encouraged the republics to state 
their demands, then refused to grant them. 



Gorbachev was a political tactician of consummate skill, coaxing the 
conservatives and restraining the radicals; but he did not win any substantial 
degree of public confidence. In the eyes of the ordinary Russian, he was 
tipicheskiy komu-nisticheskiy aktivist -a typical Communist activist. Gorbachev, 
and his Western admirers, seemed to grasp neither the elementary features of the 
Soviet system which he was running nor the unavoidable consequences of Soviet 
history. They ignored the implications of removing coercion from a machine that 
had known no other driving force. They abandoned the Party's dictatorial 
powers, the spine of the body politic, and were surprised when the limbs stopped 
responding to the brain. They underestimated the effects of decades of Party 
indoctrination which rendered the majority of administrators incapable of 
independent thought. They persisted in thinking of the Soviet Union as a natural, 
national entity -moya strana ('my country'), as Gorbachev was still calling it in 
1991. Above all, they misjudged the effect of Glasnost on the suppressed 
nationalities, for most of whom freedom of expression was equivalent to 
demands for independence. Tinkering was the worst possible course of action. 

Much ink has still to be spilled on the causes of communism's collapse. Political 
scientists inevitably put their emphasis on systemic political causes, economists 
on the failings of the economy. It may be that equal attention should be paid to 
the everyday lives of ordinary people. There are some excellent anthropological 
studies of East Europeans struggling with the absurdities of life under 
communism. It now seems that a generation which had lost the pervasive fear of 
the Stalinist era suddenly decided that enough was enough. As the Party bosses 
lost the will to enforce their authority, millions of men and women simply lost 
the inclination to obey. Communist society was as rotten at its grass roots as it 
was at the top.- Independent culture, especially religion, played a greater role 
than is often supposed. Artists and believers were often the only people who 
could imagine a world without communism. The rest were like the inhabitants of 
a submerged planet in a science fiction story which the censors had failed to 
spot. They had been trained with great difficulty to live under water; when the 
water began to subside, they had forgotten how to breathe in the open air.- 

Once again, in this final round, the earliest cracks in the edifice appeared in 
Poland. Material conditions were deteriorating; renewed strikes loomed. 
Desperate ministers turned to the leader of the banned Solidarity union, Walesa. 
It was an admission of political bankruptcy. Early in 1989 they called round- 


table talks to discuss power-sharing with the illegal opposition. The result was an 
agreement whereby Solidarity would compete for a limited number of 
parliamentary seats. The elections produced a sensation: Walesa's people swept 
the board in every constituency where they competed. Many prominent 
communists were unable to get themselves re-elected, even where they were the 
sole candidates: voters simply crossed them off the ballot. In this most recently 
'normalized' of 'communist countries', communist authority was fast 
approaching zero. 

In June 1989 China showed the world what demons lurked beneath the skin 
of communists facing popular wrath. Gorbachev, on an official visit to Beijing, 
witnessed the protests though not the massacre. He could not fail to draw 
conclusions. Later, when visiting East Berlin for the 40th anniversary of the 
state, he let it be known that the DDR could not count on the use of Soviet 
troops. There was to be no Tiananmen Square in Europe. The Brezhnev Doctrine 
had died before anyone noticed. 

In August Poland's bewildered communists invited Solidarity to form a 
government under their own continuing communist constitutional and state 
presidency. Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a devout Catholic, was accepted as Premier. 
He took his seat in the Council of the Warsaw Pact. The Soviet bloc was no 
longer a bloc. Hungary was engaged in its own roundtable talks. Regular 
demonstrations were being organized by the Protestant Churches of East 
Germany. 

The decay was well advanced, therefore, when the avalanche began to slip in 
the autumn of that annus mirabilis. In Budapest, on 23 October, on the 33rd 
anniversary of the Hungarian national rising, the Hungarian People's Republic 
was abolished. The Hungarian communists admitted the Opposition into the 
parliament, whilst turning themselves into a social democratic party. Still more 
astonishingly, in Berlin on 9 November 1989, East German border guards stood 
idly by as crowds on both sides of the Berlin Wall demolished it with gusto. The 
DDR government had lost the will to fight. In Prague, on the 17th, a student 
demo went wrong: a demonstrator was reported killed by the police. But then, a 
week later, Havel and Dubcek appeared together on a balcony in Wenceslas 
Square before the adoring crowds; and a general strike soon finished off the 
unresisting authorities. The 'velvet revolution' was complete. The sharpest of 
foreign observers on the spot was moved to utter the much-repeated quip: 'In 
Poland it took ten years, in Hungary ten months, in East Germany ten weeks, 



and in Czechoslovakia ... ten days.'- Finally, over Christmas, a bloody uprising 
in Bucharest, where the hated Securitate defended itself to the death, culminated 
in the grisly execution of the Ceausescus. 

Gorbachev's role, though honourable, has been exaggerated. He was not the 
architect of East Europe's freedom; he was the lock-keeper who, seeing the dam 
about to burst, decided to open the floodgates and to let the water flow. The dam 
burst in any case; but it did so without the threat of a violent catastrophe. 

In 1990, the practical consequences of the previous year's crash began to 
work themselves out. First the CMEA, then the Warsaw Pact, ceased to function. 
One after another, the ruling communist parties bowed out. Every new 
government declared itself for democratic politics and a free market economy. 
With varying degrees of haste, treaties and timetables were drawn up for the 
phased withdrawal of Soviet troops. In Germany, the drive for reunification 
accelerated. The organs of the DDR simply evaporated. The. West German 
parties began to campaign in the East, and a general election was won by 
Chancellor Kohl. In October the Federal Republic formally absorbed the 
citizens, territory, and assets of East Germany. The fires of freedom spread far 
and wide on the westerly wind. Bulgaria and Albania ignited, as did the 
constituent republics of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. Slovenia and Croatia, 
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Chechenia all declared their independence, as yet 
unrecognized. Bosnia and Macedonia, Armenia, Georgia, Moldavia, and Ukraine 
were poised to follow suit. 

The pulverization of the Yugoslav Federation was specially vicious. 
Democratic elections had brought militant nationalists to the fore both in Serbia 
and in Croatia. In Belgrade, the Federal State Council was overtaken by the 
designs of a Serbian leadership stoking the passions of a 'Greater Serbia'. When 
in August 1990 the Serbs of Knin in Croatia rebelled against Zagreb, the stage 
was set for the open wars, which erupted the following Spring. After a miserable 
rout in Slovenia, the Serbian-led Yugoslav army launched its assault on Croatia. 
Panic and intercom-munal violence rapidly gripped several parts of a 
disintegrating state, where ethnic minorities were as common as compact 
majorities. Just before his death, Tito had sighed: T am the only Yugoslav.'- It 
was not true. But, with the genie of ethnic violence on the wing, it was all but 
impossible for supranational 'Yugoslav' policies to be asserted, [cravate 

[ILLYRIA] [MAKEDON] [SARAJEVO] 

Only in Poland did the pace slacken. The country which had been the first to 


loosen the communist yoke was the last to cast it off. The Mazowiecki 
Government gave priority to economics. In December 1990 Walesa pushed his 
way to the presidency after losing a quarter of the votes to a stooge of the ex¬ 
security service. Liberation from a parliament still dominated by communists 
took ten months more. According to the old stereotypes, the Polish Revolution 
was rather un-Polish. 

The reunification of Germany was undertaken impetuously, not to say 
thoughtlessly. No one questioned the propriety of reunification. 'What belongs 
together', said Willy Brandt, 'is now growing together.' But when the ex-DDR 
became part of the Federal Republic, it was automatically joined to the European 
Community with no questions asked; and, contrary to the advice of the 
Bundesbank, the O-Mark was exchanged for the D-Mark at the rate of one for 
one. Little thought was given to the political and financial costs for Germany or 
for Germany's neighbours. The Government in Bonn took it for granted that East 
Germans, being Germans, would welcome the imposition of the institutions of 
the Federal Republic, and that the West Germans, being Germans, would pay for 
it cheerfully. The prospect dawned that a united Germany might not be so 
interested in Europe as a disunited Germany had been. As public opinion grew 
more anxious and self-centred, the Federal Government felt obliged to reassert 
its commitment to European integration. 'In a symbolic act of profound 
significance, the same Article 23 of the Basic Law under which German 
unification had been achieved was amended... so that the Federal Republic, 
instead of being open "for other parts of Germany", was now committed to "the 
realisation of a united Europe".'- 

Decommunization proved a thorny problem in all post-communist countries. 
The prevailing laws, though lacking legitimacy, could not be abandoned 
wholesale. The communist nomenklatura, now declaring undying devotion to 
democracy, could not be dismissed en masse. The ex-secret policemen could not 
be easily unmasked. Germany was rocked by the exposure of thousands and 
thousands of Stasi informers; Poland reopened investigations into political 
murders; in Romania, the new regime was actually opposed to 
decommunization. Czechoslovakia was alone in passing its Lustracni zakon, or 
'Verification Law', which sought to exclude corrupt or criminal officials. 

The legacy of Soviet-type economies was dire. Despite initial successes, 
such as the currency reform and the conquest of hyperinflation under Poland's 
Balcerowicz Plan (1990-1), it became painfully clear that no overnight remedy 


was to hand. All the former members of the bloc faced decades of agonizing 
reorganization on the way to a viable market economy. 2 In the mean time, their 
problems could be used to exclude them from the European Community. 

Everywhere, the social attitudes engendered by communism persisted. 
Embryo civil societies could not rush to fill the void. Political apathy was high; 
petty quarrels ubiquitous; residual sympathy for communism as a buffer against 
unemployment and surprises was greater than many supposed. The decades 
'under water' had conditioned the masses to disbelieve all promises and to 
expect the worst. The cynical idea that someone loses if someone else is gaining 
was all but ineradicable. No one could have guessed the dimensions of the 
devastation. 

The fact that communism died without a fight did not ease the pain which it 
left behind; there was no catharsis. One participant complained of 'the 
impossibility of epiphany in peacetime'. Another remarked: 'I'm happy to have 
lived to see the end of this disaster; but I want to die before the beginning of the 
next one.'- 

The second stage of the avalanche, in the Soviet Union, began to slide in 1991. 
Economic reform had made no appreciable progress; material conditions were 
deteriorating. Over the winter, Gorbachev had drawn closer to the Communist 
Party apparatus. Several of his colleagues resigned in protest against the 
impending reassertion of dictatorship. Most ominously, the national republics 
were lining up to follow the example of the Baltic States, where national and 
Soviet authorities governed in parallel. In Moscow itself the city council elected 
a democratic mayor, whilst the Government of the RSFSR elected a democratic 
president, Boris Yeltsin. Yeltsin began to distance Russia from Gorbachev's 
Soviet Kremlin. Armenia and Azerbaijan were at war over Nagorno-Karabakh. 
In Georgia, where Gorbachev had earlier sanctioned the use of deadly force, the 
revolt against Moscow was finalized. In Vilnius, where Soviet troops had also 
killed civilians, the Lithuanian parliament despaired at the lack of outside 
support. The Kremlin was moving to replace the USSR with a much looser 
union of sovereign republics. The new union treaty was set to be signed on 20 
August. 

The abortive Moscow coup of 19-22 August 1991 was launched to stop the 
Union Treaty, and thereby to preserve the residual power of the CPSU. It 
precipitated the disaster which it was supposed to prevent. The plotters were in 


no sense 'hardliners': they were committed to the limited form of perestroika 
which they had good reason to believe was Gorbachev's own preference. Indeed, 
they clearly believed that Gorbachev himself would acquiesce. As a result, they 
made none of the provisions which competent putschists make. In fact, it was 
not really a coup at all; it was the last twitch of the dying dinosaur's tail. On 
Sunday 19 August, seven nervous apparatchiks appeared in a row on Soviet 
television and announced the formation of their emergency committee. They 
were obeyed by the Party's organs and media. They had timed their action to 
coincide with Gorbachev's last day on vacation in Crimea. When he refused to 
deal with their emissary, they had nothing else to propose. Yeltsin, unarrested, 
clambered onto a tank in front of the Russian Parliament and breathed defiance. 
No move was taken to disperse his supporters; the tanks on the streets had no 
ammunition and no orders. After three days, the plotters simply climbed into 
their limousines and drove off. The attempted coup proved beyond doubt that the 
system was brain-dead. The Soviet communists were still in control of the 
world's most formidable security apparatus; but they could not bring it to 
perform the simplest of operations. 

For a time, Gorbachev did not grasp what had happened. He flew back from 
Crimea still talking about the future of the Party and of perestroika. He was 
brutally brought back to reality by Yeltsin, who made him read out the names of 
the plotters to the Russian parliament. They were Gorbachev's men every one. 
Gorbachev's credit was exhausted. He resigned as General Secretary just before 
Lenin's Party dissolved itself. On 5 September 1991 the Soviet Congress of 
Deputies passed its last law, surrendering its powers to the sovereign republics of 
the former Union. On 24 October 1991 Gorbachev issued a last decree, splitting 
the Soviet KGB into its component parts. He was left stranded as the figurehead 
president of a ghost state. 

Nothing better illustrated the realities of the Soviet collapse than the fate of 
Sergei Krikalyev, a Soviet cosmonaut who was fired into space in May 1991. He 
was still circling the earth at the end of the year for want of a decision to bring 
him back. He had left a Soviet Union that was still a superpower; he would 
return to a world from which the Soviet Union had disappeared. His controllers 
at the Baikonur Space Centre found themselves in the independent republic of 
Kazakhstan. 


December 1991 was a month of decision at both ends of Europe. It started on 1 



December with a referendum in Ukraine, where 91 per cent of the people, 
including the great majority of the Russian minority, voted for independence. 
The Republic of Ukraine was second in Europe in territory, fifth in population. 

On the 9th and 10th at Maastricht, the twelve leaders of the European 
Community met to consider their scheme for comprehensive European union. 
Having banished the dreaded 'f-word',- the British Prime Minister inserted a 
monetary opt-out clause, refused to sign the social chapter, persuaded his 
partners to reconfirm the role of NATO, and claimed a famous victory. Fears 
were expressed that Variable geometry' and a Two-speed Europe' were in the 
making. Yet the great bulk of the Treaty's provisions were accepted. The leaders 
initialled agreements which provided that citizenship of the Union would be 
given to all citizens of member states (Title II, 8-8e), that members should 
follow a common economic policy (II, 102-109111), that EMU and a European 
Central Bank (ECB) were to be achieved by 1999 within a joint banking system 
(II, 105-108a), that the European Parliament should be given powers of co¬ 
decision with the Council of Ministers (II, 137-138a,158,189-90), that an 
advisory Committee of the Regions was to be established (II, 198a-c), that 
common foreign and security policies were to be pursued (VI), and that 
subsidiarity should leave most Community action To Member States' (II, 3b). 
They accepted detailed chapters on education, culture, health, energy, justice, 
immigration, and crime. Outside the Treaty, they also confirmed recognition of 
the three Baltic States, but not Croatia or Slovenia. It was ah suspiciously easy. 
All that remained was ratification. It would not be long before merchants of 
doom would be predicting the Treaty's demise.- 

That same weekend, President Gorbachev was making a last vain attempt to 
summon the heads of the Soviet Republics to Moscow. Unbeknown to him, 
however, the leaders of Russia, Byelorussia and Ukraine were already 
negotiating in a forest hunting-lodge near the Polish border. At 2.17 pm on 8 
December they signed a declaration stating that The USSR had ceased to exist'. 
Next day they announced the creation of a Commonwealth of Independent 
States. The CIS was a convenient cover behind which the core of the strategic 
arsenal could be kept under a single command whilst most other Soviet 
institutions were quietly buried. By the end of the year, the peaceful passing of 
Europe's last empire was complete. 

Some small steps were taken to bridge the East-West divide. NATO 
established a Joint Co-operation Council to which former Warsaw Pact members 


were invited. The European Community signed treaties of association with 
Poland, Hungary and Czecho-Slovakia. A joint European Bank of Development 
and Reconstruction was opened in London. Food and financial aid was sent to 
the ex-Soviet Union, and peace-keeping missions to ex-Yugoslavia. Yet the steps 
were exceedingly small. The EC was still blocking agricultural imports from the 
East, throttling trade. Except for German investment in East Germany, Western 
investment in the former East was minimal. No co-ordinated foreign policy was 
forthcoming; no effective action was taken to contain the looming wars in 
Croatia and Bosnia; no dynamic leadership emerged. The gulf between 'White 
Europe' and 'Black Europe' still gaped. 

Events moved so fast after 1989 that few observers had the leisure to reflect on 
the interdependence of Western and Eastern Europe. The habits of a lifetime led 
people to assume that East was East and West was West. Western statesmen were 
preoccupied with the cultivation of their own gardens; they did not readily notice 
that the explosion which had demolished their neighbours' house had blown 
away their own fence and gable. 'They leaned against the Wall in comfort,' a 
Hungarian had written, 'not knowing that the Wall was made of dynamite.'- 

For 40 years the Iron Curtain had provided the framework for political and 
economic life in the West as well as the East. It had defined the playing-field for 
Marshall Aid, for NATO, for the EEC, for Germany's Federal Republic, for 
Western Europe's economic success. It had been extremely convenient, not just 
for the Communists but also for Western bankers, planners, and industrialists, 
whose efforts could be directed to the easy part of Europe. It was specially 
advantageous for the protectionist element within the EEC, and hence for the 
distortions of the CAR In short, it was one of the factors which threatened to 
turn Western Europe into a short-sighted and self-satisfied rich man's club, 
careless of other people's welfare. It was responsible for attitudes mirroring the 
Brezhnev Doctrine, where 'the gains of capitalism' had to be defended at all 
cost, where Western statesmen dreamt of perpetuating their isolation indefinitely. 
In the long run, Europeans would have to face the choice either to rebuild their 
village in unison or to reinvent the Iron Curtain in a new guise. 

In reality, the events of East and West in Europe were closely connected. The 
success of the European Community, as seen from the East, had been a potent 
factor in the failure of the Soviet bloc. The success or failure of the post¬ 
communist democracies would condition the fate of European Union. Moscow's 


retreat from Eastern Europe and from critical regions such as that of oil-rich 
Baku would create new arenas where the new Russia might feel compelled to 
resist expanding Western firms and institutions. 

To some, the common denominator seemed to lie in the universal attachment 
to liberal democracy and free market economics. The Western victory appeared 
to be so complete that one academic gained instant fame by asking whether the 
world had reached 'the End of History'.- Nothing could have been further from 
the truth: Europe was locked in an intense period of historical change with no 
end in view. 

In the eyes of one ex-statesman, the revolution of 1989-91 had given rise to 
three Europes. 'Europe One' consisted of the established democracies of Western 
Europe. 'Europe Two' coincided with the Visegrad Triangle of Poland, Hungary, 
and Czecho-Slovakia plus Slovenia. These four post-communist countries had 
reason to hope that they could join the European Community with no greater 
obstacles than those overcome in the previous decade by the post-fascist 
countries of Spain, Portugal, and Greece. 'Europe Three' comprised the 
remaining countries of the former Soviet bloc, whose European aspirations 
would have to await the twenty-first century.- 

Yet declarations of goodwill could not of themselves bring results. The 
priority given to economic considerations was suffocating the wider vision. Any 
rigid insistence on economic convergence was bound to delay the Community's 
enlargement, perhaps indefinitely. On the other hand, any major enlargement 
was bound both to involve extensive costs and to strengthen the case for 
institutional reform. If Germans could resent the costs of integrating seventeen 
million fellow Germans, other member states of the Union were unlikely to 
welcome the sacrifices required for integrating ever more new entrants. If 
governments were to face difficulties over ratifying the Maastricht Treaty, they 
would encounter much greater problems implementing it. 

As the march towards further enlargement and integration proceeded, 
therefore, resistance was bound to intensify. In a forum of potential confrontation 
between the Community and its sovereign members, the status of the European 
Court would become a critical issue. A 'Europe of Sixteen' or a 'Europe of 
Twenty' could not be managed by the structures that had sufficed for 'The Six' 
and The Twelve'. The European Union would steadily grind to a halt if it did not 
reform its governing institutions as part of the drive towards widening and 
deepening. 


According to one pessimistic observer, Europe would only be persuaded to 
integrate further if faced by extreme catastrophe-that is, by scenes of genocide, 
by mass migration, or by war.- By the same line of reasoning, monetary union 
would only be achieved through the collapse of the existing monetary regime: 
and political union through the manifest failure of political policies. 'Europe 
One' might only be driven to accept 'Europe Two', if'Europe Three' reverted to 
form. 

In December 1991 neither integration in the West nor disintegration in the East 
had run their course; yet very few Europeans could remember a time when so 
many barriers were down. The frontiers were open, and minds were opening 
with them. There were adults too young to remember Franco or Tito. One had to 
be nearing 30 to recall de Gaulle or the Prague Spring, 50 the Hungarian Rising 
or the Treaty of Rome, 60 the end of the Second World War. No one much under 
retirement age could have any clear recollections of pre-war Europe. No one 
much under 90 could have active memories of the First World War. Centenarians 
were the only persons alive to have known those golden days at the turn of the 
century before the great European Crisis began. 

Count Edward Raczyriski (1891-1993) belonged to this last rare company. 
He was born in Zakopane, on the border of Austria and Hungary, to a Polish 
family which possessed large estates in Prussia. Their palace in Berlin had been 
demolished to make way for the Reichstag. He had studied in Austrian Cracow, 
at Leipzig, and then at the London School of Economics. He had served as 
Polish Ambassador to the League of Nations and from 1933 to 1945 at the Court 
of St James. He later became President of Poland's Government-in-Exile. He 
could never go home. But on 19 December 1991 he was honoured on his 100th 
birthday in the Embassy which Britain's alliance with Stalin had forced him to 
surrender forty-six years before. Newly married, he was one of the very few 
indefatigable Europeans to have seen off the European Crisis from start to finish 
-if finished it was. 




Europe, 1992 

14 February 1992, Summertown. In the beginning, there was no book. Now 
the last words are rolling onto the last pages. The desk beside the window of the 
top studio is dimly lit by the dawn. The night frost has left patches of damp on 
the roof that glistens through the glass. Clouds amble over the dark skyline 
towards the brightening band of pale yellow. The leafless apple trees of the old 
Thorncliffe Orchard straggle through the gloom towards the next row of red¬ 
brick Victorian houses. A solitary crow stands sentinel on the tip of the highest 
beech, as on a thousand such dawns since The Legend of Europa' was written. 
For once, the foul fumes of the Oxford Automobile Components factory are 
blowing elsewhere. The family slumbers on towards school-time. 

The family connections of this house span half of Europe. One side of the 










family is firmly attached to this offshore island, to Lancashire and, further back, 
to Wales. The other side was rooted in the eastern parts of old Poland, which 
spent most of the last hundred years either in Austrian Galicia or in the Soviet 
Union. After education in Oxford and in Cracow, the two principals of the house 
met on the Boulevard Gergovia in Clermont-Ferrand, in the city of Blaise Pascal, 
who might well have been amused by such an infinitesimal probability. These 
happy accidents inevitably colour one's sense of history. Time and place in the 
writing of history are sovereign. Historians are a necessary part of their histories. 

Today is the feast-day of SS Cyril and Methodius, the co-patrons of Europe. 
Prayers at the Jesuit church of St Aloysius 'celebrate the origins of the Slavonic 
peoples ... May their light be our light.' The rosary is recited 'in the intention of 
the peoples of eastern Europe'. The priest explains, eccentrically, that Cyril and 
Methodius were apostles of the Poles, Czechs, and Hungarians (see Chapter V). 

School-time. This week at Squirrel School, the headmistress has been talking 
at assembly about the needy children of Albania. 

The morning's newspapers have nothing to say about SS Cyril and 
Methodius. The Independent leads with 'UN Troops for Croatia'. The Guardians 
'Europe' supplement leads with an extended report on shopping in Murmansk. 
Yesterday's El Pais from Madrid leads with the formation of joint Franco- 
Spanish brigades to fight the Basque organization ETA; it has just recruited 
'Mikailo Gorbachov' as a monthly columnist. In Le Monde, three pages of North 
African news predominate. De Telegraaf from The Hague gives its top spot to a 
problem with NATO's low flying F-16 fighters. The front page of Siiddeutsche 
Zeitung from Munich is taken up with the affairs of the federal finance ministry. 
Gazeta Wyborcza, two days in the post from Warsaw, is preoccupied with the 
Constitutional Tribunal and its rejection of a statute on pensions passed by the 
communist-run parliament. The Oxford Times writes a leader about its own letter 
column, which is headed by a communication from the Anglican Bishop of 
Oxford on the priestly ordination of women.- 

The only major story of historical interest appears on the front page of the 
Corriere della Sera, under the headline 'Massacrateli' ordine di Lenin'. Moscow 
is the growth-point of knowledge about modern European history. A 
correspondent in Moscow, quoting Komsomolskaya Pravda, lists hitherto secret 
documents from the archive of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism. They reveal 
the Bolshevik leader's personal insistence on revolutionary atrocities. On 11 


August 1918, for example, Lenin wrote to the Comrades at Penza: 

The rising of the five Kulak regions must be met with merciless repression ... There's need to make an 
example. 1) Hang not less than 100 Kulaks, rich ones, blood-suckers, ... 2) Publish their names. 3) Take all 
their food away. 4) Pick hostages according to yesterday's telegram. Do everything so that the people will 
see, tremble, and groan for miles and miles around ... PS. Search out hard people. Lenin.- 

These flourishes do not come from the correspondence of Hitler, comments the 
Corriere. So it's true. Bolshevik barbarity did not start with Stalin. 

The week's home news has been dominated by mean pre-election wrangles, 
mainly about money. Abroad, one could choose between the travails of the 
French President, the future of the ex-Soviet nuclear arsenal, the conviction of a 
world boxing champion, or a decision of Ireland's Constitutional Court to deny 
abortion to a 14-year-old rape victim. The President of the European 
Commission has submitted proposals for a larger budget-'to match the Age of 
Maastricht'. The British tabloids have greeted this last item with derision. Under 
the headline 'No, Jacques, It's Not All Right', the editorial of the Daily Mail 
comments: 'Such Euro-largesse could so easily find its way into the pockets of 
shady contractors, or under the mattresses of colourful, but lazy, characters, 
basking in the Mediterranean sun.'- Le Monde analyses the phenomenon: 'La 
Grande-Bretagne se mobilise contre les "eurocrates'".- 

Above all, there is the 16th Winter Olympics at Albertville and Courchevel 
in Savoy. The 'blue ribbon' event, the men's combined downhill and slalom 
skiing, has been won by an Italian, Josef Pollg. 

The European, which claims to be the only all-European newspaper, has 
recently lost both its crooked publisher and its hero in the Kremlin. This week's 
lead story, 'Italy Faces the Wrath of Europe', reports on Rome's poor record in 
implementing EC directives. The business section slams opposition from 
'American isolationists' to a $10 billion IMF scheme for stabilizing the Russian 
rouble.- 

In late morning, as predicted, it has started to rain. The papers' weather maps 
illustrate the range of their readers' interest. The Times publishes three weather 
maps-two larger ones for the British Isles (less the west of Ireland), for a.m. 
and p.m., and one centred on the mid-Atlantic. Le Monde has two weather maps 
for Europe, and one for France. The Corriere has one for Europe from the 
Atlantic to the Crimea, another for Italy. The SZ has three spacious maps, all for 


the whole of Europe, providing detailed information from a score of weather 
stations bounded by Reykjavik, Lulea (Sweden), Lisbon, and Athens. Gazeta 
Wyborcza has no weather map, but lists the previous day's temperatures from 
selected European capitals-Rome and Lisbon (13 °C), London (10 °C), Athens 
(9 °C), Vilnius, Riga, Tallinn, and Minsk (+1 °C), Kiev and Prague (+1 °C), and 
Bucharest (+3 °C). Varsovians do not know what the temperature is in Moscow. 

The European splashes out with the largest of all weather maps, in colour. It 
marks the new republics, including Slovenia, Croatia, Belarus, and Moldavia, 
but not Russia, which is wrongly equated with the CIS. The accompanying list 
of 'European road works' mentions nothing further east than the A9-Bad 
Diirrenberg crossroads near Leipzig. So it's true: they don't mend roads in 
Eastern Europe. 

Such is the tangle of daily information from which future historians will have 
to make sense. 

Today is St Valentine's Day. By tradition, it is the day when birds begin their 
mating; so it also became the day when human lovebirds exchange suitable 
signals. The Times publishes page after page of cryptic, and frequently 
ungrammatical, messages: 

AGATHA AARDVAARK, All my love Hector Tree.... ARTEMIS, Not only Hesperus entreats Thy Love, 
Algy... . CHRISTIANE, Un vraie couscous royale. Je t'aim infini-ment, King... . MENTEN, Blue Seas in 
Basalt Rocks... . MOONFACE loves Baby Dumpling and Smelly... . POOPS, Ich bin deiner, bist du 
meine? Wirst du sein mein Valentine?- 


Several papers give contradictory explanations of the origins of St 
Valentine's Day. One version says that the medievals adopted the Roman festival 
of Lupercalia; Lupereal or 'the wolfs lair' was the cave where Romulus and 
Remus had been reared by the she-wolf and where Romans would later smear 
themselves in goats' blood in the hope of parenthood. Neither of the two Roman 
martyrs called Valentine can be held responsible for the pagan frolics. 

Today is also the tricentenary of the Massacre of Glencoe. It turns out that only 
38 persons were killed. 'In the context of clan history,' says Lord Macdonald of 
Skye, 'the numbers involved were minimal.' So there are still Macdonalds 
enough to march with the pipes to the Glen of Weeping. In any case, as The 
Times reports, the Campbells were acting 'as agents of the Westminster 


government'. Now that's a topical note. Last week's Die Zeit devoted a major 
feature article to the roots of Scotland's separate identity; it was accompanied by 
a photo of a huge graffito from Glasgow, 'Brits Out Now'.- 

Writing to music is a practical habit. BBC Radio 3 helps the ink to flow. At 
07.35 the first paragraphs were started to Bach's Concerto for oboe d'amore, 
BWV1055. The morning papers were accompanied by Rachmaninov's Piano 
Concerto No. 3. St Valentine's Day was suitably preceded by Tchaikovsky's 
symphonic fantasia, Francesca da Rimini. At 2 p.m. the Katowice Brass was 
missed, but Beethoven's Eighth is giving strength to the afternoon. Today, there 
is a good balance between West and East. For once, BBC 3 is not playing 
Janacek. 

It is an irony that historians, who study the past, are invariably pressed to predict 
the future. It helps to have followed the drift of events, but not much. 

To the west, across the ocean, the USA has surely reached the peak of its 
power. It looks to be heading for trouble with its debt, for trouble with its allies, 
and for trouble from the 'diversity' of its own citizens. It has specially 
intransigent problems with Japan, whose economic prowess has wounded 
America's pride. It is drifting away from Europe, to which it is no longer bound 
by the chains of the late Cold War. Vice-President Quayle in London this week, 
protesting to the contrary, did protest too much. 

To the north, in Scotland, the independence movement has started to roll 
again. This week, an absolute majority of Scots expressed a preference for 
changing the country's status. They possess the power to destroy the United 
Kingdom, and thereby to deflate the English, as no one in Brussels could ever 
do. They may make Europeans of us yet. 

To the south, in the heartland of the present European Community, both the 
French and the Germans are feeling the strain. France is beset by the weight of 
Muslim immigrants from North Africa, by the nationalist backlash of M. Le Pen, 
and by a socialist presidency that has outstayed its welcome. Germany is reeling 
under the costs of reunification. In their distress, both governments have turned 
to closer European union for comfort and support. This week, a television 
programme on 'The Germans' showed the German Chancellor quoting Thomas 
Mann, who longed 'not for a German Europe, but for a European Germany'. The 
Germans may lose their enthusiasm if they have to lose their Deutschmark. 


To the east, the map of Europe is still in flux: a new state seems to be 
established every month. There is much talk of the dangers of nationalism. 
Where does it come from? It would be more convincing if it targeted the larger 
and more dangerous nationalisms, not the petty ones. Not that the dangers do not 
exist. The three Baltic States are afloat in a sea of troubles. Poland, Hungary, and 
Czechoslovakia are aiming at full membership of the EC by the end of the 
decade. Czechs and Slovaks may be heading for a divorce. Romania, Bulgaria, 
and Albania have nowhere to go. The Yugoslav Federation must surely split up 
soon. Slovenia and Croatia, like Belarus', Ukraine, and Moldavia, should prove 
viable, if left in peace. The Commonwealth of Independent States, however, is 
unlikely to survive; and in its present form the Russian Republic looks no more 
healthy than the CIS. It is still a vast artificial amalgam, twice the size of the 
USA, with a very uneven economic infrastructure and no political cement. Its 
leaders can hardly hold it together by democracy and a prayer. They may have a 
chance if Moscow allows the Far Eastern Region to drift in the direction of 
autonomy and Japanese investment, and if Siberia is encouraged to develop its 
own resources with foreign help. European Russia, as always, has too many 
people and too many soldiers, and not enough to feed them. The Russians have 
drawn on their exceptional powers of stoic endurance through two years of 
Soviet collapse; but they may not do so indefinitely. If democratic Russia does 
not prosper, it will start to fragment still further. In that case, autocratic Russia 
will try to reassert itself with a vengeance. 

The collapse of the Soviet Empire is certainly 'the greatest, and perhaps the 
most awful event' of recent times. The speed of its collapse has exceeded all the 
other great landslides of European history-the dismemberment of the Spanish 
dominions, the partitions of Poland, the retreat of the Ottomans, the 
disintegration of Austria-Hungary. Yet it is hardly an event which calls for the 
historian to sit on the ruins of the Kremlin, like Gibbon in the Colosseum, or to 
write a requiem. For the Soviet Union was not a civilization that once was great. 
It was uniquely mean and mendacious even in its brief hour of triumph. It 
brought death and misery to more human beings than any other state on record. 
It brought no good life either to its dominant Russian nationality or even to its 
ruling elite. It was massively destructive, not least of Russian culture. As many 
thoughtful Russians now admit, it was a folly that should never have been built 
in the first place. The sovereign nations of the ex-Soviet Union are picking up 
the pieces where they left off in 1918-22, when their initial flicker of 
independence was snuffed out by Lenin's Red Army. Almost everyone agrees: 



'Russia, yes. But what sort of Russia?'- 

The most obvious fact of the Soviet collapse is that it happened through 
natural causes. The Soviet Union was not, like ancient Rome, invaded by 
barbarians or, like the Polish Commonwealth, partitioned by rapacious 
neighbours, or, like the Habsburg Empire, overwhelmed by the strains of a great 
war. It was not, like the Nazi Reich, defeated in a fight to the death. It died 
because it had to, because the grotesque organs of its internal structure were 
incapable of providing the essentials of life. In a nuclear age, it could not, like its 
tsarist predecessor, solve its internal problems by expansion. Nor could it suck 
more benefit from the nations whom it had captured. It could not tolerate the 
partnership with China which once promised a global future for communism; it 
could not stand the oxygen of reform; so it imploded. It was struck down by the 
political equivalent of a coronary, more massive than anything that history 
affords. 

The consequences of so massive a shock were bound to affect the whole of 
Europe. It was an open question whether the peoples of the ex-Soviet Empire 
could continue to reorder their affairs with a minimum of blood and hate. That 
the collapse occurred so peacefully was proof that it was ripe to happen; but the 
national warriors who took the field in the Caucasus and in Yugoslavia had many 
potential imitators. Not surprisingly, the countries of Western Europe had reacted 
to the Soviet collapse with excessive caution. Governments were slow to assist 
the struggling republics. Some, in the name of misplaced stability, were eager to 
keep the Soviet Union and the Yugoslav Federation alive. They were in a phase 
of confusion, and of half-measures bungled by competing agencies. 

Paradoxically, the threat of anarchy in the East may well act as a spur to 
closer union in the West. Last year, Albanian refugees sailed across the Adriatic 
in their tens of thousands, and tried to force their way into Italy. Hordes of 
Russian, Ukrainian, and Romanian tramps and traders are pouring into Poland, 
just as Poles recently poured into Germany and Austria. Germany's wonderful 
capacity of absorption is under the severest strain, not only from millions of 
unemployed East Germans but also from thousands of legal asylum-seekers, 
whose presence cannot be popular. If scenes of disorder were to be repeated on a 
larger scale, and in Central Europe, the sense of urgency in Western capitals 
would be wonderfully enhanced. So far, the consolidation of the European 
Community has been proceeding at the pace of the slowest. A strong blast of 
cold air from the East might quicken the pace. 


Much depends on developments in America. So long as the USA remains 
strong and relatively prosperous, the status quo in Western Europe is unlikely to 
change suddenly. NATO will be preserved, and the European Community will 
evolve by measured steps. If and when the USA moves into crisis, however, the 
countries of Europe would draw together for common protection. An Atlantic 
gale from the west could have the same effect as a cold east wind. 

Europe, like nature itself, cannot abide a vacuum. Sooner or later, the European 
Community in the West and the successor states in the East must redefine their 
identities, their bounds, and their allegiances. Somehow, at least for a time, a 
new equilibrium may be found, perhaps in a multilateral framework. Regional 
groupings such as the Baltic Council, the hexagonale, and some form of ex- 
Soviet club or clubs, could all play their part. But somewhere between the depths 
of Russia and the heart of Europe a new dividing line will have to be established 
-hopefully along a border of peace. 

'Europe, yes. But what sort of Europe?' The old Europe, which existed before 
the Eclipse, has passed away. With the poet, one can regret its passing and its 
ancient, clear-cut walls: 

Fileur eternel des immobilites bleues, 

Je regrette l'Europe aux anciens parapets!- 

But one cannot bring it back. The present 'Europe', a creature of the Cold War, 
is inadequate to its task. The moral and political vision of the Community's 
founding fathers has almost been forgotten. 

Europe is not going to be fully united in the near future. But it has a chance 
to be less divided than for generations past. If fortune smiles, the physical and 
psychological barriers will be less brutal than at any time in living memory. 
Europa rides on. Tremulae sinuantur flamine vestes. 

* Meaning 'I am a doughnut'. He should have said, 'Ich bin Berliner'. 

* To British ears, federalism was coloured by American, as opposed to 
German or Continental, usage, and was taken to be a codeword for a centralized 
United States of Europe.
