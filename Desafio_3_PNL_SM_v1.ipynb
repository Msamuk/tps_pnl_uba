In March 1991, after a three-month stay at Dr Bharat Vatwani\\u2019s Shraddha Nursing Home in Mumbai, Gangadhar Vinode, then 17, returned to his village near Wakad, in Pune. Earlier that year, the schizophrenic was found lying by a drain in Mumbai and had been picked up by staffers of Missionaries of Charity.\\nWhen Dr Vatwani, who used to help the Missionaries of Charity with their work, saw him at the centre, he decided to take him under his wing. \\u201cHe was not in good shape; I told them I wanted to try and cure him,\\u201d Dr Vatwani says. Towards the end of his stay at the nursing home, Vinode provided Dr Vatwani his address in Wakad, and the doctor rode down to Pune to inform his parents about their son. The next day, Vinode\\u2019s parents and grandfather arrived at the nursing home with tons of sweets, performed an aarti for Dr Vatwani, and left with their son.\\nVinode, who has a shy smile and a childlike excitement, has just completed his third housing project in Pune. After being successfully treated by Dr Vatwani, he resolutely got back to work on his family\\u2019s farm, set up a brick kiln and a service centre for cars before eventually moving into construction about six years ago. He says he has no recollection of what happened to him that winter 27 years ago. All the 46-year-old wrestling buff remembers is going to Kolhapur to spend some time at an akhara, and preparing to return after a month there.\\n\\u201cI had boarded a bus bound for Pune, but somehow I found myself in doctor sir\\u2019s nursing home,\\u201d says Vinode. \\u201cSince then, it\\u2019s been God, my parents and Dr Vatwani.\\u201d His colleague, Lawrence Fernandes, and nephew Vishal Wakadkar, say they still find it tough to believe that \\u201cGanga bhau\\u201d, who co-runs Vinode Constructions, once roamed the streets oblivious to everything.\\nBut Dr Vatwani has been battling the odds since he was a child. After his father, a high ranking government official, died an untimely death, he and his brothers, who were then still in school, sold photos of movie stars to their classmates, and books and gramophone records to the residents of Bandra, where they lived, to make ends meet. He would ring the doorbell, say he was hard up, and offer his wares.\\nHe has been on the other side as well. About a decade after he started his nursing home along with wife Smita, he slipped into severe depression when his desire for a bigger set-up met with resistance from locals and was mired in a court case. The courts eventually ruled in his favour, but it was a meeting with the late social activist Baba Amte in the 1990s that changed his life.\\nDr Vatwani was driving down to Hemalkasa, in Gadchiroli, where the Amtes worked among the Madia Gond tribe, when he spotted a mentally ill man, his hands and feet bound in chains, walking by the road. He coaxed him to come with him in the car.\\n\\u201cThat was how I first met Baba Amte and Prakash (Amte\\u2019s son). I landed up there with an unwashed, bedraggled man in chains, and told them we needed to get those chains off.\\u201d Prakash Amte, says Dr Vatwani, took a hammer and started striking the links in the chains. The next morning, Dr Vatwani found Baba Amte crying.\\n\\u201cHe said he empathised with the plight of wandering mentally ill people, but had never been able to do anything for them. He said while I was doing good work, it was not enough. He said I was \\u2018chosen\\u2019, and that fired me up,\\u201d says Dr Vatwani, who set up the 120-bed Shraddha Rehabilitation Foundation, in Karjat, in 2006, and has since then helped people from across the country reunite with themselves and their families.\\nHe is also aware of his advancing age, and hopes that the Magsaysay award will help him find people whom he can hand the baton over to. \\u201cI\\u2019m pushing 60, how long can I keep up with this? If it can get more NGOs, bureaucrats and society to talk about the mentally ill destitute, that would be good, especially in a country where religion and black magic are still supposed to cure mental illness. If it were not for his family\\u2019s support, Vinode would have taken much longer to be the man he is today.\\u201d Baba Amte, says Dr Vatwani, ignited the spark in him, and now he is looking for others with the \\u201csame spark\\u201d.\\nToday, many of his former patients, including Vinode, regularly donate funds to NGOs and organisations involved in mental health care, and each time he spots a mentally-ill destitute, Vinode makes it a point to bring him home and bathe him, or if he is violent, call up local organisations to take care of the person.

(1991) Biochimie (Paris) 73, 219-226] and the effect appears to be independent of DNA sequence, suggesting a general change of protein conformation upon DNA binding. The CD of DNA is changed, indicating an alteration of the DNA structure, possibly related to stretching and unwinding. A small, reversible, decrease in the CD amplitude of RecA was observed when raising the temperature from 4 degrees C to 30 degrees C. The CD of RecA increases slightly with pH (up to 7.8) but is constant between pH 6.0 and 6.8. At pH below 6.0 or higher temperature (40 degrees C) slow irreversible denaturation of RecA occurs. The CD signal is effectively independent of salt, even in 2.2 M NaCl or 1 M sodium acetate, which is relevant regarding reported ATPase and coprotease activities promoted by salt. For high concentrations of magnesium (10 mM) at 30 degrees C the CD of RecA changes markedly and the appearance of light scattering indicates aggregation.\\nCan you provide a summary of the conformational changes in RecA protein observed during the formation of helical RecA ATP fibers and its interaction with double-stranded DNA and ATP[S] cofactor?\",\n",

              " 'Given the text: Are You Struggling With High Attrition Rates? We are operating in a tight IT talent market, and few organizations can afford to lose high-level employees. If you struggle with high attrition, you probably find yourself lagging behind your competitors in other areas, as well. Now is the time to stop struggling with turnover and start building and retaining a tech team that will help your company succeed. The most obvious impact of a high turnover rate is an increase in costs. Hard recruiting costs will soar if you are in a constant state of sourcing, interviewing, selecting and onboarding replacements. The costs go much deeper when you factor in the lowered morale and productivity that are associated with attrition. Those problems can amplify quickly, resulting in decreased customer satisfaction, reduced innovation and a lack of creativity and new ideas. The longer a company experiences high turnover, the worse the situation becomes. People are more connected than ever thanks to social media and internet platforms, and if your company has been branded as an organization with a revolving door, it becomes a real struggle to attract strong talent that might have staying power. And thus, the cycle continues. Digging out of high-attrition quicksand can take some time, but it can be done with a commitment to drilling down to the root cause of the problem and taking the necessary steps to correct it. For some organizations, this means a major cultural shift. For others, it may mean changes in management. Still others may need to develop a more competitive compensation plan, stronger onboarding processes, more effective development programs, a path for advancement, etc. Solving your company’s unique attrition puzzle often begins with talking to your most successful IT employees. Find out why they stay and what makes them so successful. Studying exit interviews can provide some insight if distinctions can be identified. If no clear pattern can be found, take those exit interviews with a grain of salt. When you know what makes some people successful within the organization and what leads to failure in others, you can determine the types of attributes to look for as you hire new employees. Hiring for fit is almost more important than hiring based on skill sets. Certain skills can be learned on the job, but cultural alignment cannot be taught. People either mesh well with the culture and existing team, or they do not. They must possess the attributes and the qualities needed to add value to the existing team. Any hiring process that does not include evaluation for fit is sure to fail over time. Rectifying high attrition requires a commitment of time and resources that many internal teams don’t have. A strategic recruiting partner can often be the best course of action to help untangle the knot and build a strategy for future success. The right partner can help you get your hiring process back on track and can connect you to the talent you need to achieve your business goals. If you are looking for top IT talent to help you achieve your goals, contact the experts at PEAK Technical Consulting today or call 1-888-888-PEAK.

Missing the target: DNAk is a dominant epitope in the humoral immune response of channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) to Flavobacterium columnare [abstract]. Fish and Shellfish Immunology. p. 1.\\nTechnical Abstract: Vaccination remains a viable alternative for bacterial disease protection in fish; however additional work is required to understand the mechanisms of adaptive immunity in the channel catfish. To assess the humoral immune response to Flavobacterium columnare; a group of channel catfish were first immunized with F. columnare LV-359-01 cultured in iron-depleted media, before being challenged with wild type F. columnare LV-359-01.The immunization protocol did not confer increased protection against F. columnare; however both control and immunized responders generated serum and skin IgM antibodies against F. columnare proteins. Western blot analyses of individuals from both groups showed that IgM antibodies were generated to the same 70 kDa extracellular protein, which was identified to be the bacterial chaperonin protein DNAk. Antibodies generated were cross reactive to DNAk proteins found in other gram negative bacteria. Our data suggests that DNAk is the dominant epitope in the channel catfish B-cell response to F. columnare.',\n",

As I was rushing to get ready to go to work, I stopped to look at Mount Banhaw from my windows.\\nI am quite lucky, as I can see the top of the mountain right from my window, and every morning I spend a few seconds looking at it. Whether it is sunny, cloudy, or rainy, the view is always incredibly uplifting; and every morning it reminds me of the beauty surrounding me if only I take the time to look.\\nThis morning was a particularly sunny morning, typical of a Filipino summer, and the sky was clear of any clouds, and I could see the tip of the mountain in all its bright splendour. I took a deep breath, taking in this reminder of the astounding creation of God in which we live; and which I am particularly lucky to enjoy in the Laguna\\'s countryside.\\nThis view is a little constrained by the many rooftops surrounding my house in the heavily built up centre of the little town in which I reside.\\nOn the roof of my neighbour\\'s house, with the corner of my eye, I saw a little bird that attracted my attention. It was in the middle of the roof, and I sensed he was about to do something of which he was quite scared, so I looked more attentively.\\nThe little bird started running towards the edge of the roof, as if to take speed before taking off. It was clearly the little creature\\'s attempt to his first flight, so I stood there holding my breath and cheering on the little guy.\\nThe little feathered friend got to a reasonable speed, and while I was expecting him to jump off, instead, he dug his little claws on the edge of the roof and like in a cartoon, he held himself back while most of his body was hanging down the edge of the roof, he looked down and took a step back.\\nAt this point, I noticed two more little birds on the thin top branches of a tree a few meters away from the roof edge. They were observing the little bird on the roof very attentively. As he was half dangling from the edge taking his step back, they started flapping their own wings very energetically, and jumping from branch to branch. They were obviously the siblings whose first flight I had just missed, and who were already experienced, compared to their little brother. They were trying to show him how to do it.\\nThe little brother on the roof watched them for a few seconds, then he tentatively took a step off the roof flapping his wings very fast, a little like when a baby tries to learn to swim and energetically moves his arms following the example of his fellow swimmers. He was in the air for just one second, and jumped back on the roof straight away, but his confidence was obviously growing.\\nThe siblings kept flapping their own wings, and jumping from branch to branch, this time however rising higher than earlier, as if to say \"here you go, keep flapping and you can really fly\"\\nSo, the little creature on the roof tried a couple of times again to jump off the roof, but again jumped back on the roof, obviously not confident enough yet.\\nThe siblings then joined him on the roof, and simply waited for him. They looked at him, he looked at them, and they looked at each other. They were patiently waiting for their little brother to take the big step, silently encouraging him.\\nA few seconds later our protagonist took a step over the roof, and flew to the nearby tree, quickly followed by his siblings. They then jumped from branch to branch a few times, and then disappeared in the distance all three flying like pros.\\nWhat a wonderful beginning of the day.

They toast up nicely, are fantastic for sandwiches, lunchboxes anything where you would usually use bread. Unlike other almond flour-based breads, you can’t detect the taste of almonds in this bread at all and they are incredibly light and fluffy. The magical ingredient here is something called psyllium husk, it’s a fibrous powder that soaks up a lot of water and provides a gelling and binding agent, similar in a way that wheat gluten does. The psyllium husk gets darker as it cooks, giving these rolls their wholegrain taste and appearance. The rolls are 2 grams net carbs each, and the dough could be shaped in any way, so you could make bagels, burger buns, whatever you like, however I have found cooking this recipe in a loaf results in a dense bread because of the weight of the almond flour. Whatever shape you make them, I’d recommend smaller rolls, biscuits, buns or bagels which remain light, fluffy and well risen.\\nI won’t take all the credit for this recipe, this has been modified from a diet doctor recipe, which was originally inspired by a Maria Emmerich recipe. I developed this recipe to use yeast as well as baking powder because I love the taste that yeast gives to bread, the addition of the yeast also adds extra fluffiness and texture to the bread.\\nSift the almond flour, psyllium husk powder, vital wheat gluten (if using), baking powder and salt into a mixing bowl.\\nIn a separate bowl mix half a cup (120 ml) warm water with the dried yeast, whisk well and leave in a warm place for the yeast to activate.\\nadd the egg whites to the flour mixture and beat until well combined, pour in the 1 ½ cups of boiling water and mix well, the psyllium husk will soak up the water and you’ll have a nice soft dough, there is no need to knead this dough like regular bread, and it is better if you don’t over mix. Leave the dough to cool for about 5 to 10 minutes until just warm.\\nOnce the dough has cooled from the addition of the boiling water add the yeast mixture, it’s important that the dough is warm and not hot, because if it’s hot it will kill and deactivate the yeast. Yeast likes the human body temperature range to work best, so aim for 37C/98F. Beat in the yeast mixture until all ingredients are combined and you have a nice soft dough.\\nTransfer the dough to a work surface dusted with almond flour, roll out into a rectangle shape and cut into three rows across and four rows down, cut each square in half diagonally so that you have 24 triangle shaped pieces of dough. At this point you can cut and shape the dough however you like, so have some fun!\\nTransfer the dough pieces to a baking tray lined with baking parchment and cover with plastic wrap, leave in a warm place (I like to put above the pre-heating oven) for 1 hour to rise.\\nAfter the rolls have risen, they should have doubled in size, remove the plastic wrap and gently brush each one with the beaten egg, then sprinkle over the topping ingredients which have been mixed together.\\nPlace into the oven and bake for 50 minutes until well risen, golden brown and sound hallow when tapped. Cool on a wire rack. Based on the passage above, Can the dough for these rolls be shaped in any way, and what is the recommended size for the rolls to remain light and fluffy?',\n",

These businesses use every shipment as a vehicle to promote their products or thank their customers. You should do the same. When you make a sale and are shipping a product, insert a short thank you note that offers your gratitude and willingness to hear from the customer or perhaps your latest catalog or flyer. This goes a long way in showing your appreciation for you customer and interest in building a long term relationship with them. 5. Online Coupons or Offers. When you have a particular product to sell, you should offer information about it on your website. Additionally, offer an incentive for prospective customers (new customers). When individuals are on your website and take interest in your product or service, providing an incentive to buy can drive considerable response rates. You might be concerned about discounting your product or service to existing customers so be clear that your offer is only for new customers. Your existing customers understand that you�re trying to grow your business and won�t be disappointed to learn that you�re giving an incentive to new customers only. 6. Free Samples. Giving away free samples is one of the most effective marketing tactics available today. Even if you have a service business, offering up a method for prospective buyers to try a derivative of your service without paying for it can lead to increased trials and conversions. Large consumer product companies like Proctor and Gamble know that once a consumer decides that he or she likes the product, they will become a customer for an extended period of time which more than pays for the cost of their promotion. 7. Encourage Referrals. Small businesses that leverage the power of referrals experience strong growth. When you have others suggesting your product or service it�s like having your very own sales team. These referrals are even more powerful because, like word-of-mouth, the prospect is being encouraged to buy from an existing customer, associate, expert, or influencer. Think about how you can encourage referrals from your customers or other service providers. One way is to ask other vendors to distribute information about your business to their customer base in exchange for you doing the same. Marketing doesn�t have to cost a lot. Use your own business to communicate your marketing messages and increase lead generation. These simple methods are effective for any small business owner regardless of industry, product, or service offering. Implement some or all of them to see the power of effective small business marketing. About the Author: Michael Fleischner is the founder and President of MarketingScoop.com.

Answer according to: Only DHC Toplofikaciya Sliven (district heating company, the company taking care of the centralized heating system in Sliven) increased progressively its subscribers in the last 2 years. The new heating season began with about 1,000 subscribers more. Previously stopped substations are being switched on and until the end of the current year their total number will exceed 280. At the end of 2011 more than 10,000 households in Sliven will be local heated. The company, that two years ago was at the edge of a bankrupt, succeeded in becoming profitable, regained people&apos;s trust and is now approaching its maximum capacity as it was 25 years ago, when there were 15,000 subscribers.\\nThe reason for the increasing number of users of this type of service in Sliven is that the TPP (thermo power plant) fundamentally changed its marketing policy. The prices of the heating permanently established themselves as the lowest in the country. The company signed individual contracts with all its clients under which the unwanted \"building fee\" is eliminated and the predictable consumption is measured on the basis of the volume of the heated living space. The customers pay after a pre-set price caps for heating as all actually spend over this amount is on DHC’s expense. Such a radical change in the approach to the citizens caused a real \"revolution\" and repeatedly increased the heating consumption in Sliven, because of the availability of the service, even to the weakest social strata.\\nDHC Sliven announced October 17 as a start date of the heating season and this is when the local heating was switched on in kindergartens, schools and hospitals as well as in domestic households, by request. By the end of the week, because of the cooling expected, heat supply will be provided to all other subscribers. 90% of the customers of TPP Sliven pay their bills regularly and are considered loyal clients. This enables them to enjoy even cheaper promotions.\\nDHC Sliven began a mass introduction of remote controlled measuring gauges. This is a big convenience for the people, because now the collectors do not have to enter the homes in order to measure the consumption. This is done by a radio method using electronic modules. Following its policy of easing the financial burden on customers, DHC Sliven will take part of the cost of the installation of the new gauges. If customers have doubts about the radio report accounting, there is an opportunity for visual reading of the display. The subscribers are aware at any time what amount of energy is being consumed and this allows them to decide how much to save. The reporting is done simultaneously in the entire substation and will no longer require additional redistribution of the incoming heat.\\nDue to the expiration time of the battery life of the old heat measuring devices, nearly 1,300 of them will be replaced. TPP Sliven will offer to its customers to install the new modern remote gauges under special conditions. The customers will pay only the price of the plain measuring devices as the radio service and its activation are at DHC’s expenses. About 10% of the customers will now experience the conveniences of a completely different quality of service on a world level, but at prices attractive for every citizen in the current circumstances of severe crisis.',\n",

Known for his plain speaking style, Jarrell went on to become the Library of Congress consultant in poetry, a role which later became the poet laureate.\\nHis writing career began when he used to post articles for the high school magazine in Nashville. From there he went on to Vanderbilt University where he edited their magazine, wrote some of his first poetry, and graduated with a BA in 1935. He taught English at Kenyon College in the heart of Ohio for a couple of years, and even at the age of 23 he was becoming a much admired critic and writer.\\nIn 1939 he was teaching in Texas and met Mackie Langham who would become his first wife. In 1942, with America’s entry into World War II, Jarrell joined the army and much of his well-known poetry stemmed from his experiences during this period. The same year he published his first collection, Blood for a Stranger, which was followed by Little Friend, Little Friend and Losses.\\nAfter leaving the army, he went back to work as a teacher, finding a position in New York at the Sarah Lawrence College. He also worked reviewing books for the The Nation, but he didn’t much care for the hustle and bustle of the city and soon left for North Carolina.\\nMost of his own work, though well received, did not make his name as a poet. Perhaps one of his most famous pieces at that time was the poem The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner, which has frequently appeared in anthologies over the years.\\nBy 1956 he was acting as the poetry consultant to the Library of Congress and had a solid reputation as an erudite and informed poetry critic. In his own early poetry writing career, Jarrell had been influenced by the works of W.H. Auden but it wasn’t until the early 1960s that he finally broke free and found his own voice in the collection The Woman at the Washington Zoo. It won the National Book Award. At the time, he also wrote a number of children’s books including The Bat Poet and The Animal Family, which included artwork by Maurice Sendak.\\nBy 1964, however, he was beginning to change, worrying about the onset of old age and deeply affected by the assassination of Kennedy in Dallas. It was something that brought his writing to a halt for a while and he was forced to seek help from a psychiatrist. In 1965, though, he published Lost Worlds which received bad reviews from the New York Times. Jarrell cut his wrists and was hospitalized. Cared for by his second wife, he returned to North Carolina and began teaching again.\\nWalking down the road one evening in 1965, Randall Jarrell died when he was hit by a car. Although there was the prospect that this had been suicide on his part, his death was judged accidental. He was just 51 at the time.\",\n",

Answer according to: NotTaR of Television Sets : Brief description of international color..\\nPAL: Very similar to NTSC, with the exception that the phase of the color subcarrier is reversed on alternate lines; this tends to cancel some of the more common color errors seen in the NTSC system. (The color signals of PAL are also simple color-difference signals, rather than using the more involved RGB -> YIQ matrix of NTSC). In the most common European PAL broadcast systems, a line rate of 15,625 Hz and a field rate of 50.00 Hs are used*.\\nSECAM: This system is very different from both NTSC and PAL. Luminance and color-difference signals are still used, but the color difference signals are sent separately, on successive lines. This requires at least a one-line memory or delay line be provided in the receiver for proper color decoding. The broadcast SECAM systems usually use similar line/field rates as for the PAL broadcast standards noted above*.\\nNote: In all three cases, the terms \"NTSC\", \"PAL\", and \"SECAM\" technically refer only to the COLOR-ENCODING systems described above; they do not specifically imply a set of timing standards or frequencies. The one possible exception to this is the use of the term \"NTSC\", since the U.S. National Television Standards Committee ALSO came up with various timing standards for U.S. television. But in all cases, the color encoding method is not STRONGLY tied to a specific line/field timing. For example, there is at least one broadcast system (Brazil\\'s) which uses NTSC encoding, but at the line/field rates more commonly seen in the European systems.',\n",

              " \"Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: How does the Audi S8 Plus handle in different driving modes, such as cylinder on demand and Dynamic mode?\\n\\nPassage: Sitting at the top of Audi's saloon family is the A8. Give it a sporty makeover and it becomes the S8. Give that a bit of a tweak and a boost and you arrive at the Audi S8 Plus, the most powerful saloon that Audi has ever put on the road.\\nAnd by the most powerful, we mean 605 pferdestärke.\\nWe've previously said that the A6 is rather stately, but for the A8 family, that's exactly what it is. The regular A8 is a large executive saloon, with the A8L offering more space for VIP transport. It's perhaps with that target market that the S8 avoids the full RS treatment, instead walking a more delicate path, preserving the prestige of this VIP cruiser.\\nThere's a formula in current Audi design that's resulted in a strong family identity. It flows from the A4 through the A6 and into the A8 and into this S8 Plus. At this top level, however, things are more understated. This isn't a model that screams horsepower in your face like some of Audi's RS models, and we can't help feeling there's a point to that: it's a subtler touch, for an owner who doesn't want to be as showy.\\nThere's the addition of carbonfibre body details in places, with the option to change the added (but small) boot lip spoiler from body coloured to carbon. The same can be applied to the wing mirror covers, and the rear lights are darkened, sitting above the S8 badges.\\nAround the front the nose gets a slight tweak with a lowered front apron with carbon trim, and a move to black for the grille, away from the standard chrome. There's also an exclusive paint colour for the Audi S8 Plus, a silver with matt effect.\\nWhat the Audi S8 Plus hangs onto is its stately elegance. The S8 Plus isn't too big for its frame, it doesn't look bloated or ungainly, but there's no escaping that this is a serious looking car.\\nIt's more meaty around the front than the BMW 7 Series, although there's a sharper drop in the rear roof line, meaning less rear window space than BMW's big saloon. Both the Audi and the BMW are more serious in posture than the Mercedes S Class, with the AMG models offering a healthy rivalry to Audi's S8 Plus in the performance executive saloon class, although this Audi undercuts the AMG in price quite nicely.\\nIf we've one criticism of Audi interiors, it can be that things can get a little samey. Sit in the interior of the A1 and you could be in the A6 Avant, depending on where you're looking.\\nThe TT broke this mould some, the R8 followed suit, but at the executive end of the spectrum in this S8 Plus (as with the A/S/RS7) you get a lift. The interior of the S8 Plus changes the switch gear, the layout and the finish, making it stand out from many of Audi's cars. This is a competitive space too, having enjoyed the interior of BMW's high-tech 7 Series, there's plenty to fight for.\\nThe heavy application of leather meets glossy piano black trim. Normally we baulk at glossy interiors because they're a fingerprint magnet, but if you're going to do it, do it like Audi. The glossy centre console shouldn't work, but as we sat in the driver's seat, we couldn't help but gaze across it.\\nThere are a lot of controls and buttons, especially to control the media system and the climate control, but the arrangement makes you feel like you're piloting a jet. You may as well be, with that much power on tap, but the use of a handled drive select lever helps reinforce this feeling.\\nThe brushed steel finish to the buttons, and stainless steel pedals brings a lift to a dark interior, with grey dials presenting your essential speed and revs. The centre of the driver's display is all digital, so can carry mapping or entertainment information from the MMI system, all of which can be controlled via the steering wheel, but you don't get the full digital treatment as you do on the Audi TT.\\nFor the rear passengers, powered blinds sit inside the double-glazed privacy glass, giving more protection from the sun, making it a peaceful place to ride. There's also active noise cancellation in the interior, as well as a boosted 14-speaker Bose sound system as standard. The back seats are ridiculously comfortable and you'd expect nothing less.\\nSlip into the driver's sport seat of the S8 and you'll notice that visibility is excellent and it's very comfortable. That will be welcome news for those who'll be driving his nibs in the back and we love that there's a central arm rest that's adaptable for both the driver and the passenger separately.\\nFinger the start button and the awakening roar of the 4-litre V8 will send a tingle down your spine. This is a boosted version of the standard S8 which offers 520PS, which, frankly speaking, is nowhere near enough power. In reality, that lift to 605PS means that the S8 Plus will hit 62mpg in 3.8 seconds, over the measly 4.1 seconds of the standard model.\\nJust pause and think about that for a few seconds. Yes, that's about how long it takes to hit the legal speed limit. The Audi S8 Plus is speed limited to 155mph, but you can have that limit lifted to 189mph if you opt for the Dynamic Package. That, importantly, adds the fade-free carbon ceramic brakes, hence the £9250 price.\\nWhile his lordship fingers his copy of Horse and Hound in the backseat, this vast saloon will eat the road as it launches itself into the horizon. From the driver's seat it's almost inexpressibly satisfying. There's little or no delay as you put your foot down and the speed hits you like a hammer.\\nThe S8 Plus squirms when you hit the pedal hard, all four wheels delivering power and dynamically fighting to keep grip and keep you heading in the right direction. You'll feel this brutal ballet through the steering wheel, driven by that snarling orchestral V8, but you don't feel out of control.\\nIt differs from the tight precision of the Audi R8. The clean delivery of power is breathtakingly fast in Audi's supercar, but feels potently aggressive in this twin turbo saloon, it's muscly and brutal.\\nBut the Audi S8 Plus manages that side of the car with panache. If you're just popping to Waitrose to buy more saffron, then cylinder on demand and the comfort mode will get you there as smoothly as any limo. It's quiet, it's peaceful, it's almost sedate, as well as being wonderfully plush.\\nTurn the corner, return to Dynamic mode and floor it, and you're back in a sports car, with tightened suspension and heavier steering making you lord of the road. While the R8 might be ridiculously assured in corners with effortless control and grip, the S8 Plus perhaps surprises: it doesn't wallow like a hearse, despite the size.\\nThen you have all the technology to keep you safe. Lots has been said about collision avoidance and autonomous systems on other cars, but Audi has been doing this for a long time. Adaptive cruise control will vary your speed in traffic to keep you a safe distance from the car in front - handy in motorway cruising - and pre-sense front will detect potential accidents and alert you, before taking measures, like pre-loading the brakes and tightening the seatbelts.\\nThis latter system we got to test, when a tractor emerged into the road on a corner with no warning. The S8 Plus audibly alerted us so we could dab the brakes and take action.\\nThe Audi S8 Plus is in some ways a marvel. It's expensive, sure. It costs £97,715 for starters, boosted to £108,115 as seen here, but as we said, most of that extra comes from the added Dynamic package with carbon brakes. The performance numbers are impressive, especially in context of the AMG rivals, with the S63 some £20k more expensive.\\nYou might think that all that power would just mean that the S8 Plus is expensive to run. Well, at 28mpg (Audi's figures), it is. Even with cylinder on demand reducing the load, this saloon is a long way from the more efficient diesel options of the regular A8.\\nThe Audi S8 Plus is going to be for the few. It's a blend of sports car performance with luxury limo comfort and priced as such. However, the S8 Plus is a marvellous car to drive. If this is on your list, just make sure you're sat up front where the fun is, rather than languishing in the rear.\",\n",

Understanding why the procedure is necessary to protect your tooth may help you feel more confident about having the procedure.\\nThe phrase “root canal” is used to describe a dental procedure, but for dental professionals, it describes a passage inside each tooth that contains the nerve and tissue known as “pulp.” A root canal removes the pulp that has been damaged by infection, a cavity, trauma to the tooth and other circumstances. Removing the damaged pulp and sealing the canal protects the entire tooth and jaw bone.\\nIf you are experiencing any of the following symptoms, you may need a root canal.\\nLocal anesthesia is used to numb the tooth and surrounding area. A small drill is used to make a hole in the crown of the tooth. The hole allows the dentist to access the pulp and nerve. The damaged pulp is removed, and the canal is sealed to prevent food particles and bacteria from getting inside your tooth.\\nWe will prescribe pain medications to help you stay comfortable after your root canal. Although not necessary, you may want to spend the remainder of the day resting at home. We may recommend a soft food diet for a few days to give your tooth time to heal. Keep an eye on the area, and if you notice any problems or have worsening symptoms, schedule a follow-up exam at our office.\\nDo You Need a Root Canal?

              " 'How does the analysis presented in the paper account for the accumulation of permanent tilt in a caisson over successive wave cycles?: Abstract: Tilting and overturning of caisson breakwaters due to wave loading is well documented. Although simplified methods of caisson analysis have been proposed, they are either fully elastic analyses that do not account for permanent displacement, or stability analyses that determine whether overturning will occur. In reality, a caisson can incur significant tilt without overturning: such a phenomenon cannot be replicated by either of the above analyses. This paper presents a simplified analysis that takes into account the elastic caisson response as well as the accumulation of permanent tilt with successive wave cycles. Elastic response was simulated using a lumpmass-spring model. Permanent caisson tilt was analysed based on the assumption of the caisson tilting over a circular slip surface beneath its base. A search algorithm was used to determine the radius and depth to the centre of rotation of the critical slip circle. Permanent tilt is generated by the difference between the overturning and stabilising moments during wave peaks. This allows permanent tilt to be accumulated over successive wave peaks. Comparison with centrifuge test data shows that the analysis is able to capture the progressive build-up of tilt reasonably well. Furthermore, comparison with a field case of caisson failure during a storm shows good correlation, although uncertainty over the number of wave cycles precludes a more direct comparison.',\n",

By the age of forty, the author had become a successful manufacturer with a town house in Kensington. But all this suddenly changed when he was wrongly charged with arms dealing in Iraq and ended up on trial in the Old Bailey in 1985. He lost his successful business, the Sterling Armament Company, his marriage and was made bankrupt. Years later, shivers erupted around Whitehall with revelations that senior officials had blocked witnesses and covered it up.\\nThe Sterling Redemption is the thought-provoking true story of James Edmiston’s epic twenty-five year battle to clear his name and the struggle for compensation against seemingly impossible odds. Edmiston suffered a double injustice: wrongful charge and waiting 25 years for justice to be done but he has never received an apology. Lord Justice Scott described the misconduct as “disgraceful and reprehensible”. However, no officials were prosecuted and some were actually promoted. This truly remarkable story is a fascinating insight into government and abuse of power and is based on many original sources including the Scott Report and Judgment of the Court of Appeal (Criminal).\\nThe co-author, Lawrence Kormornick, is a Solicitor-Advocate (civil) who has represented Edmiston and several other victims of the Arms-to-Iraq prosecution scandal against the government and has a unique insight into these cases. Packed with ironies, twists of fate and many unanswered questions it is a compelling read for anyone interested in political intrigue and abuse of power, miscarriage of justice and learning about how Edmiston took on the state and won record compensation.

His offbeat approach leaves behind archaic diplomacy of 20th century and adopts ‘disruptive diplomacy’ for minorities, migration and middle class. His government’s budget of 2019, presented by Finance Minister Bill Morneau on March 19, 2019 is called ‘Investment in the Middle Class’.\\nThough there are usual as well as unique issues like Housing affordability, Health care, reconciliation with indigenous community and even high speed internet access as well as skill-training, I would like to critically focus on the issues related to science, climate change.\\nAs a Coordinating Lead Author of 2007 report of IPCC’s (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), I am convinced that 2019 federal budget of Canada has shown serious commitment to address its pledges under Paris Climate Agreement. Sadly, the pledges under the Paris agreement have found to be inadequate as per ‘Gao Report of United Nations Environment. IPCC’s Special Report on 1.5 deg C stated that net global CO2 emissions need to fall by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and reach “net zero” by around 2050 if the temperature rise has to be limited to 1.5 deg C’. That would need sky-rocketing ambition, bold policies and daring implementation. What we see in the budget is docile middle path chosen by Trudeau’s government en-route to reach the targets stated by IPCC.\\nCanada’s ardent, unequivocal and lasting support for the single most successful global agreement, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that deplete the ozone layer has been hailed as critical element in the global success in protecting the stratospheric Ozone Layer. Canada staunchly stood behind the treaty and even hosted the Secretariat of the Multilateral Fund to assist the developing countries to move away from the ozone depleting substances. Multilateral Fund under the Montreal Protocol that has contributed by all the developed countries, to this date continues to be uniquely successful example of financial and technology cooperation between developing and developed countries.\\nThat environmental legacy of Canada went through continental breach in 2011, when Canada became the first country to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol of United Nation Framework on Climate Change, after 14 years of its engagement.\\nPrime Minister Justine Trudeau, son of a Liberal Prime Minster has been, since 2015, making gallant efforts to wash that tarnished image of Canada and to seal the trust gap created by the earlier PM Stephen Harper, son of oil-Executive.\\nWhat I found as the most honest attempt by the Federal Budget is to end the era of coal. Coal power plants produce 9 percent of Canada’s electricity. Closing down all the coal plants by 2030, has been bold decision. There are smart provision for workers currently in coal plants to enable them to go through a smooth transition away from coal industry. There is also allocation for protecting their wages. pensions and skill development in non-coal area through a special fund. Indeed, there is lesson for President Trump on such transition strategy away from coal, rather than winning the election by protecting the coal-power plants and the workers.\\nAnother high point is that the budget proposed to address the issue of the reduction in fossil fuel subsidies, though in very passive way. First it proposed to add transparency in reporting the subsidies and also appoint the international panel to review the report of self-review. This is the lesson in transparency for all other G7 countries.\\nCanada, on the basis of size of the economy, however, remains the largest provider of fiscal support to oil and gas production among the G7 countries. The government is clearly supporting the fossil fuel industry through huge subsidies, amounting to USD 2.5 billion. Just to understand how big is this amount, that amount would provide free education to 260,000 Canadian students. Step towards transparency is good but accelerated reduction in subsidies as promised would have been better for the carbon-neutral world that IPCC recommends.\\nOne year from now is the ‘2020 deadline’ for developed countries like Canada to fulfill their promise to mobilize $100 billion USD per year of international climate finance in support of the Paris Agreement of 2015.\\nUnfortunately, 2019 federal budget does not indicate how Canada is contributing its just share to this Green Climate Fund (GCF) to enable the transition of the developing countries away from fossil fuel.\\n100 per cent zero-emission vehicles by 2040, investing $1.01 billion in 2018–19 to increase energy efficiency in residential, commercial and multi-unit buildings and financial assistance to community led climate initiatives are some of the helpful but not bold steps as demanded by Special Report of IPCC.\\nIn Mumbai, I asked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau why his climate change actions are not as bold as what Canada took at the time of the Montreal Protocol? He said Canada is now bolder. That may be true but budget shows that IPCC’s Special Report requires not just bold steps but aggressive and accelerated steps to deal with brutal climate change. Federal Budget 2019, fails to take that opportunity.\",\n",

              " 'The PlayStation 4 will be available in the United States for $399 on November 15. Sony\\'s latest system packs more power and features than ever before. The console is equipped with an 8-core AMD Jaguar processor, 8GB of GDDR5 memory, and AMD\\'s next-generation Radeon GPU. It also includes a user-replaceable 500GB hard drive, a Blu-ray Disc drive, and a laundry list of new social features.\\nThe PlayStation 4 box includes the system, an assortment of connection cables, a DualShock 4 controller, a basic mono headset, and a quick start guide. For a limited time, Sony will also be throwing in a network voucher, which includes a 30-day free trial to PlayStation Plus and Music Unlimited, along with a $10 credit to the PlayStation Store.\\nThe console connects to your television through the HDMI port, while an AC power cord will bring the system to life.\\nThe first time you power on the system you will be asked connect the controller and configure things like language settings, Internet connection, and the date and time.\\nThe new PlayStation Camera (an optional accessory priced at $59.99) connects to the back of the system and can be mounted on top of the TV or in front of it. After the setup process is complete, you must create a new user account.\\nOnce the console is up and running, you will be prompted to install a system software update. This will enable Remote Play, voice chat, online multiplayer, support for Blu-ray movies, and various sharing features, among other things. The patch is approximately 300MB in size and can be installed over the air or with a USB drive.\\nSony completely revamped the PlayStation 4\\'s user interface, abandoning the PlayStation 3\\'s slow and dated interface for a more responsive and simpler approach. The design is similar to Microsoft\\'s strategy with the Xbox -- large high-resolution images pinned to a horizontally scrolling home screen.\\nThe interface includes five tabs: What\\'s New, The Playroom, Live from PlayStation, Internet Browser, and Library.\\nThe What\\'s New tab displays information relating to your friends, such as status updates, recorded videos, screenshots, and more. The Playroom is a preloaded augmented reality game that utilizes the PlayStation Camera and DualShock 4 controller. Gamers can kick, swat, and shake small robotic creatures using their feet, hands, or the controller. It\\'s a gimmicky feature that will surely entertain young kids.\\nA \"share\" button on the DualShock 4 allows gamers to share previously recorded and live gameplay with others from around the world. These broadcasts can be found in the Live from PlayStation tab on the console\\'s home screen.\\nHitting the up arrow reveals a secondary menu. From here you can access the PlayStation Store, along with Notifications, Friends, Messages, Parties (a voice and video chat feature), Profile options, Trophies, Settings, and Power.\\nA handful of useful (and some what unknown) features can offer an even better user experience. For example, you can double tap the PlayStation button on the controller to return to your last open app or program. This makes it easy to quickly switch between reading an online guide and trying to get to the next checkpoint in Killzone (or any other game).\\nThe PlayStation 4 also supports a variety of voice commands for launching games and powering down the system. These commands can be launched by pressing the L2 button on the controller.\\nThe PlayStation Camera brings even more functionality to the system, giving gamers the ability to automatically login to the console using only their face. This can be done by selecting the \"Login Settings\" options from the system settings menu and enabling the \"Face Recognition\" option. Next, click on Face Recognition Management and select the \"Add Face Data\" option.\\nThe camera will capture four images of your face from a variety of angles. The feature worked like a charm, although you are still required to hold the controller to prevent accidental logins.

State police said Matthew Edwards sustained a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to autopsies completed Tuesday.\\nThe News Journal has independently identified the victims as Matthew, 42; his wife Julie, 41; Jacob, 6; Brinley, 4; and Paxton, 3. State Police confirmed the parents\\' names.\\n\"Her world was her kids,\" Horney said Tuesday, recalling the woman she first met at Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children when their children shared a hospital room.\\nBoth Edwards\\' son and Horney\\'s daughter have rare genetic disorders that united the women over the last seven years. The oldest Edwards child, Jacob, had Williams syndrome, a developmental disorder that affects many parts of the body, including appearance and intellectual ability, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine.\\nJulie became heavily involved with the Williams Syndrome Association in support of her oldest son, and served as a regional director for the associations, Horney said. The family also participated in weekend walks and conferences regularly.\\nNow, the community is reeling in the wake of Monday night\\'s homicide. Police were called to the home at 2709 Ferris Road at 8 p.m. after the family was found dead inside. A 911 call reported an \"unknown medical emergency\" to numerous first responders who were dispatched to the scene.\\nNo motive for the killings was released by state investigators.\\nFrom the onset of the investigation, police told neighbors they had no reason to fear for their safety.\\nInstead, the surrounding community was left reeling from the tragedy that struck on the otherwise quiet block.\\nThose neighbors lined the sidewalks around the home Monday night looking for answers. Some speculated, while others hung their heads in sadness as the details filtered out to them.\\nAlready, a GoFundMe – \"Help fund Edwards family funeral\" – created to support the funerals of the Edwards\\' children has raised more than $2,000 with a goal of $20,000.\\nA few neighbors, such as Wilfredo Rivera, said they\\'d learned recently of marital problems inside the Edwards home. Rivera said he heard about them as recently as Sunday.\\n\"He was telling me about his problems while his kids were running up and down the street,\" Rivera said Tuesday.\\nRivera said he was more acquaintance than friend of Matthew Edwards, though the killing of three children just across the street saddened him.\\nOther friends who didn\\'t live in the neighborhood learned of the news when it hit TV and Internet screens.\\nWhen Nina Boyer saw footage of the house where state police were investigating Monday night, her heart sank. She used to live in the neighborhood and still lives nearby.\\nA closer shot of the home made the tragedy even more real.\\n\"Oh my God,\" she remembered thinking. \"I know that house. I know those people.\"\\nA call to Stephanie Peterson, a fellow teacher at a church day care in Marshallton, confirmed Boyer’s fears: It was the Edwards\\' house.\\nA post on Facebook shortly after from Julie Edwards’ brother affirmed what they already knew.\\nBoth Peterson and Boyer got to know the Edwards at the day care where the two youngest children attended preschool.\\nBrinley, the middle child and only girl, began going to the day care when she was about 1 1/2 years old back in 2015, Boyer said, adding that she worked with Brinley in the toddler room.\\nAs the years passed, Paxton, the youngest boy who was only a year younger than Brinley, also came to the day care.\\n\"Paxton just followed his big sister around,\" Boyer said. \"And (Brinley) was my narrator. She was wise beyond her years, 3 going on 23.\"\\nPeterson agreed, adding Brinley often came off as years older in the way she talked and spoke with people.\\n“She was always asking questions and she always wanted to learn,” Peterson said.\\nThe relationship between the teachers and the Edwards family furthered as the children spent more time at the school. Peterson also began babysitting for the family at their home, where she came to know their oldest son, Jacob.\\nBut the boy was full of hugs and smiles, Peterson said. Occasionally, he would come to the day care after school, Boyer said.\\n\"He was just a happy, happy boy,\" Boyer said. \"He loved music. He loved to dance.\"\\nMolly Merrill met Julie Edwards when they were dropping their kids off at the same day care. They never became close friends, but Merrill said she leaned on the experience Julie Edwards accumulated raising Jacob.\\nMerrill’s daughter, Michaela, has Sanfilippo Syndrome, a rare metabolic disorder that manifests in young children first through symptoms like speech problems and developmental delays.\\nMerrill described Julie Edwards as a role model, someone who’d already passed through the learning phase of raising a child with special needs, eager and willing to share her knowledge.\\nOver the past months, Merrill said Julie Edwards seemed to glow with positivity. She’d lost a lot of weight, Merrill said, and changed her hair. Her friend, Brianna Horney, said she had lost 90 pounds since the start of the year and was trying to help other friends do the same.\\nHer Facebook posts were also uplifting and self-assured, Merrill said.\\n“She was really taking such good care of herself. It seemed like she was doing so well,” Merrill said.\\nIn many ways, it did not surprise the women who knew her, saying she was impossible to forget — a woman who both Boyer and Peterson said made friends everywhere she went.\\n\"She would drop the kids off and an hour later I would still find her in the building talking to somebody,\" Boyer said. \"She was always talking to somebody. She never met a stranger. And her kids were the same way.\"\\nPeterson grew to know Julie Edwards more closely, buying her first pair of LuLaRoe leggings from the mother of three. Julie Edwards sold Perfectly Posh, Tastefully Simple and some other product lines online to help support the family, Peterson said.\\nThe kids stopped coming to the day care in December, Boyer said, and though she didn\\'t know why specifically, she kept in touch with the family on social media and saw that the children stayed at home with their mother.\\n\"I just want people to know how full of life they were,\" she said. \"They were friends with everybody. When you talked to Julie, you felt like she knew you for years.\"\\nNeither Peterson nor Boyer knew much about Edwards’ husband, whom both women met through the day care.\\nSome of Matthew Edwards\\' neighbors said they knew, though none said they had a close relationship with him. Those neighbors said he’d lost a local job and had taken up work out of state more recently.\\nRivera said he was talking with his neighbor Sunday afternoon, but on Tuesday morning couldn’t remember his name. Their relationship was cordial, but not deep.\\nRivera said he knew Matthew Edwards enjoyed hunting and owned firearms. He said on Sunday Matthew Edwards told him he and his wife weren’t getting along anymore.\\n\"I just patted him on his shoulder and told him to keep his head up and don\\'t let something like that discourage him and to take care of his kids,” Rivera said.\\nWhen Kim Ternenyi last saw Julie, the mother gave her lettuce and green beans from her garden.\\nTernenyi, who lives right behind the Edwards, said she didn’t know how Julie kept up with all the energy she had to keep up with three children, especially while Matt was working down south. She said Julie was constantly going to Baltimore or Kennett Square with the kids.\\n“She just told me she couldn’t stay in one place,” Ternenyi said.\\nBut nothing could prepare neighbors for the news that the family living across the street or around the corner was dead.\\n“I’m just shocked. There was no way to prepare for this,” Covenko said.\\nHe and his wife remembered going trick or treating with the family. The Edwards\\' all dressed up as characters from Star Wars. One of the three children was R2-D2.\\n“We were close,” Covenko said. \"I still don\\'t believe it.\"\\nPeterson said she knew that Matthew Edwards had struggled in the past with jobs, but he was largely quiet and she had not seen the family in a few months since they stopped coming to the day care.',\n",

              " 'Can you suggest some ways to plan out the marketing for a product launch? Answer according to: Are you planning to launch a program or product this fall? Whether this is your first launch or tenth, here are 5 tips that will help you execute a successful launch. Even though these may seem like simple steps, I’ve seen clients skip one or more of these and then wonder why their launch wasn’t as successful as they thought. Plan from the end backwards. The easiest way to make sure you have all of the moving parts working together with a launch is to see how you want the end to be and work backwards from there. This includes how the information will be delivered to people who purchase. For example, if you are selling a program where they will receive a new module every week for 6 weeks, how will the client access the information? Will there be a member area where they can download the info? Or will they receive an email with downloadable links to the information, etc.? You may find it helpful to map it out in a spreadsheet, showing the different pieces of the launch, when it’s due and who is responsible for it. Once you’ve got this created, you can re-use this system for future launches. Don’t forget to plan out your marketing, too. Things like how many emails you’ll send to your list and when those will go out; where and when you’ll promote it on social media (will you buy ads or not); if you will ask joint venture partners to participate; if you have affiliates, what resources will they need to help promote your launch? Big tip here – give yourself enough time to launch. I’ve seen more failed launches because someone didn’t give themselves enough time to put everything together and to market it sufficiently. Get your team together. Now that you’re clear on exactly how you want the launch to lay out, you can get your team together to help make it happen. Once you’ve got your team in place, I suggest having a group telephone meeting to go over the timeline of the launch. This way, everyone is on the same page as far as what has to happen, when it’s due and what’s expected. They can also add any suggestions they have to make things move smoothly or more efficiently. Chances are they’ve worked on other launches and have some valuable input. Joint Venture/Affiliate Partners. Now is the time to reach out to possible joint venture partners. Get a commitment from them that they will promote your launch. Let them know how many emails you expect them to send out and when. Give them the emails to send out and make it as effortless for them as possible. They may have their own launch to promote and you may agree to help them as well. Be sure to let them know what the commission structure is. I’ve even seen people have contests for the “winning” affiliate, the person who has the most people sign up under their affiliate link. Test everything. You don’t want to have your launch start and find out that the buy now button on the sales page doesn’t work. This is where giving yourself enough time comes in handy. Test the technology, test a purchase, test the follow up emails. Yes, technology can go down at any time, but if you know ahead of time that everything works, you can rest easy. If you plan on having unusual amounts of money coming through your merchant account, you may even want to give them a heads up. I recently had a client do a book launch. She has a brick and mortar business, so not a ton of activity goes through her online shopping cart. All of the book purchases went through her shopping cart and her merchant account shut down half way through because there was so much “unusual activity”. It all worked out, but it was an inconvenience for buyers that could’ve been avoided. Launch and evaluate. You’ve launched and either it was what you thought, better than you thought or worse than you predicted. Use this information for your next launch. What worked? What didn’t? What could’ve been better? If it didn’t go as good as you anticipated, don’t beat yourself up. Use the data to improve. You may even have a great launch one month and 6 months later, the same program doesn’t go as well. Use it as a learning experience and tweak it as necessary. Have you had a launch experience that can benefit others? Please share it below. Excellent article Joanne ! I really like the first one. Plan from the end backwards.

In the intervening four years, I’ve significantly changed how I make chili. This isn’t a recipe per se, it’s more of a description of the process I use to make chili.\\n3 cans of beans, drained – The Goya 15.5 ounce cans are fine. I’ll usually put in kidney beans, chick peas, and Roman beans, but use any beans you like.\\n2 – 15 ounce cans of tomato sauce – I like Hunt or Del Monte sauce. Don’t cheap out on this, the tomato sauce is an important flavor in your chili.\\n1 – 15 ounce can of diced tomatoes, drained – The low-sodium ones are best. Avoid the ones with spices, you’ll be flavoring these quite thoroughly on your own.\\nHabaneros – preferably orange ones. One and a half of these will get the chili pleasantly spicy, three will make the chili quite hot.\\n1 heaping teaspoon of mustard – I use Grey Poupon, you can substitute mustard powder if that’s what you have (but don’t use as much).\\nCinnamon powder – perhaps as much as you would add to coffee grounds to get a slight taste of cinnamon.\\nSlice the onions and garlic, and slowly saute them in a little bit of olive oil. You don’t want these fried, but caramelizing them would be overkill; try to maintain some of the sharpness of the onions. A medium to low flame for about 20 minutes should do the trick. Add oil from time to time and stir.\\nWhile this is going on, slice the habaneros into small pieces. I use gloves for this, since habaneros juices hurt if you get them into a paper cut or under a fingernail.\\nPut the tomato sauce and diced tomatoes into a medium-sized pot and turn the flame on low. When the onions and garlic are done, add them to the pot. Stir this from time to time, scraping the bottom of the pot to keep things from sticking.\\nIt’s time to saute the habaneros. Despite what I’ve been told about using a high flame for this, I find a medium flame preserves the non-spicy flavors of the pepper. Cook them for a minute or two, then add them to the pot.\\nUse the frying pan to cook the ground meat, then add it to the pot along with the beans.\\nNow it’s time to add the spices. I used to use an entire row of spices, including chili powder, oregano, and paprika, but I prefer to cook the chili for less time and let the flavors of the ingredients stand out more. You may need salt of you’re using one of the blander fake ground meats (cough Quorn cough). Add less than you think you’ll need; you can always add more later on.\\nCook the chili on a low flame, hot enough to barely bubble. Keep stirring and scraping the bottom; even with a teflon pot, you’ll get chili sticking to the bottom and burning if you don’t.\\nOptional: A small can of corn nuggets or sausage. Add them when you add the meat and the beans.\\ni am not seeing in the recipe how long you have this simmer for before ready. is it 30 minutes? 2 hours? 6 hours?\\nThis isn’t a recipe per se, it’s more of a description of the process I use to make chili.\\nGenerally, cook it until it’s done. An hour or maybe two? Keep tasting it until it’s as spicy as you want it to be.\\nAnother tip–I like the fact that chili changes a little with each reheating, so I don’t do this, but If controlling the amount of spiciness is important to you, then you could put the spicy peppers in a cheesecloth bag and cook it like that, pulling the bag out when you’re happy.\\nCan you provide an estimated cooking time for the chili?',\n",

Often, hypochondria persists even after a physician has evaluated a person and reassured them that their concerns about symptoms do not have an underlying medical basis or, if there is a medical illness, the concerns are far in excess of what is appropriate for the level of disease.\\nI know it is right of him to worry about is health. We have 3 young kids anyway and he is just in his early thirties. So now I am thinking that he is just worrying needlessly. I keep assuring him that his hypertension is manageable and that there is nothing else that is wrong with him. As long as he eats the right food and keeps on exercising, then he is just fine.

              " 'What are the essential features for successfully live streaming events?: The context–your company is planning a large event with expert speakers, fascinating workshops, and top-tier opportunities for networking. As it stands, it already sounds like an excellent plan for a successful event. Yet, as the old adage goes–there’s always room for improvement! Nowadays, streaming live events is a popular way to do just that.\\nFor example, did you know you could use a video hosting platform to record and distribute your content? That’s just one of the various marketing methods your company can develop and execute in order to promote your event. There’s a whole world of streaming solutions out there just ready and waiting.\\nNow, let’s take a look a key features for streaming live events below.\\nThe first important feature for successfully streaming live events is a top-tier CDN. The term CDN stands for Content Distribution Network. A global network of computer servers comprises a CDN.\\nThese servers rapidly duplicate video content and share it via the network. This makes video much faster for users. It also provides benefits like security, redundancy, and better loading speeds.\\nThere are many CDNs on the market today. In the past, we’ve written CDN comparisons to review these services. But here’s the short version: Akamai is the biggest, fastest, and best CDN on the market today. DaCast uses Akamai for every live stream and video on-demand. This way, we give each user affordable access to premium top-tier content delivery.\\nThe second feature that’s great to have for streaming live events is a live countdown. Basically, this feature allows you to embed a video player on your websites before your event takes place. The player will show a countdown to your event.\\nThis is a simple feature, but it can boost excitement for your events. All Dacast plans include this features. It’s easy to add a live countdown to your events.\\nThe third feature that’s essential for successful live events is using a white-label OVP. White label refers to a platform that doesn’t include any branding except your own. You can insert your own logos and customize the video player to match your colors and branding. With a professional-grade video platform like DaCast, this is easy to do.\\nThe fourth feature on our list is live event recording. Recording a live stream should be easy. Sure, you can do it manually on-location. But cloud recording is easy, fast, and makes it simple to get a live streamed event online as a video on-demand within minutes.\\nDaCast includes a live streaming recording feature with all pricing plans. Turning on this feature only takes a few clicks, and it records all your live streams in the highest available quality.\\nThis information can be used live, while your stream is in progress, to assess success. You can also utilize it afterward to help refine your strategy and improve future streaming live events.\\nConsumer-grade video platforms like YouTube can’t offer many of these features. These platforms are designed to make money off you—not to help you monetize your streaming live events.\\nInstead, you need a professional-grade Online Video Platform like DaCast. A professional OVP offers a wide range of features that simply aren’t available with free platforms. Plus, these platforms include customer support and professional services to help you build a professional platform and keep it running smoothly.\\nDaCast includes all the above features. Our service also includes monetization, API access, and much more. All this is delivered at an affordable price that’s competitive with every other platform on the market.\\nAt first glance, content marketing seems pretty simple – create content that’s valuable to your customers. However, it’s a bit more complex than that. Content marketing, especially for events, is all about strategy. Events only last for a limited period of time, so you’ll need to plan ahead, paying special attention to timing.\\nFor example, in terms of social media, you may use Facebook primarily for pre-event marketing. Then, you can use Twitter and Instagram to live tweet and share photos during the event itself. Finally, you can move on to a video-based strategy for promoting the event after the fact.\\nOther social media platforms can be used to help engage an audience before, during, and after an event. Instagram and Facebook are incredibly popular, and along with Twitter, form the trifecta that every organization should at least consider using.\\nUse a hashtag for your events (for example, #DaCast2016).\\nConsider using images and videos. Visual content often does better on social media than text alone.\\nOrganize some sort of contest or giveaway on social media.\\nRelease teasers and snippets to generate more buzz.\\nConsider using live polls and surveys to engage with the audience even more.\\nIf recording your event is not part of your marketing plan, you should get on it! In 2019, if there is no video, it didn’t happen. Video is a crucial part of preparing for content marketing after an event takes place, and even while the event is happening.\\nVideo recordings allow for many marketing opportunities after the fact. These range from the simple (selling the recording to anyone who is interested) to the complex (re-broadcasting the recordings periodically to further capitalize on the time and money that went into holding the event).\\nTo ease this process, look into using a white-label business video hosting provider such as DaCast to simplify your video embedding onto your website to monetize your stream.\\nSponsors and partner organizations can serve a few valuable functions. For starters, they can be a source of valuable back-links to your event website. Secondly, they can serve as hosts for guest posts, which increase your SEO rank and also expose your event to new audiences. Finally, sponsors and partners can provide financial support to help make other marketing efforts possible.\\nIf you’re ready to try live streaming events today, we offer a 30-day free trial (no credit card required)!

              " 'Experiential marketing enables prospects and customers to interact and connect with your offering in a way that creates memorable branded experiences. Based on these brand-related encounters, customers become more connected to and invested in your offering. This results in increased awareness and sales for B2C, B2B and NFP (not-for-profit) brands. The growth and interaction of social media, content marketing and mobile provide an environment that’s ripe for experiential marketing. As a result, these branded encounters augmented through mobile devices seamlessly produce highly effective social media engagement that yields content marketing in the form of images and video, social media commentary and ratings and reviews. To better understand how to apply experiential marketing to your brand’s social media, content and mobile marketing, here are the five core attributes. Think of a brand experience like a children’s museum where kids can walk up and interact with exhibits rather than just look at paintings, photographs and sculpture. As any docent will tell you to get children to understand art you must translate it to terms they understand and can relate to. For example, when my nephew was three, my mother and I took him to see the Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. My mother asked my nephew what the temple made him think of. His response: a puppet show since the stone in the back was cut out like a puppet stage so visitors could see the interior of the structure. The use of connected devices locates your potential customer in space and time. This translates to the need to create social media and content marketing that’s contextually relevant to where your prospect is and what he or she is doing. For marketers, this means truly understanding your marketing persona and your social media buyer persona. In the process of experiencing your brand, potential buyers connect emotionally with your products and services. As a result, they gather additional purchase-related information that goes beyond a marketing defined explanation of benefits. The experience narrows the time lapse between the zero, first and second moments of truth. (Here’s an explanation of the 4 moments of truth for marketing.) Specifically, prospects gather hands-on practical knowledge of your brand. Further, and more important from a marketing perspective, is that prospects and customers talk passionately about your offering creating word-of-mouth both in real life and on social media platforms. This amplifies your credibility because in a world where customers don’t trust advertising, it’s not what you the marketer say but rather what your customers talk about. With the increased ownership and use of mobile devices, both smartphones and tablets, consumers are more able to enhance and share their product experiences. In the process, they can gathering additional product information, capture images and videos, connect with family, friends and colleagues, and share their opinions via social media. From this perspective, the amazing popularity of the ephemeral social media mobile app Snapchat that enables users to send friends photographs and videos that disappear within a short time period without a trace makes sense. Experiential marketing makes your brand relevant to your prospects and customers by leveraging the combined power of social media, content marketing and mobile. What is your definition of experiential marketing? How have you used it to increase your organization’s brand awareness and sales? We’d like to wish our Jewish readers a very Happy New Year. May it be a sweet one and may it bring the world closer to peace. This post is dedicated to my mother who became a docent after she retired and was a kid magnet in any museum. She taught me the power of making complex ideas into digestible chunks of information. Tags Brand, content marketing, Experiential marketing, Mobile marketing. Bookmark the permalink.

Tens of thousands of leaflets were distributed in synagogues across the country recently, promoting the ancient custom and presenting it as a solution for the single daughters of Israel.\\nThe phenomenon of a man married to several women (polygamy) was common among the people of Israel in ancient times. King Solomon was married to 1,000 women, King Rehoboam had 78 wives, and King David had \"only\" 18.\\nAbout 1,000 years ago, however, Rabbi Gershom issued a ban on bigamy, forbidding the custom among Ashkenazi Jews. Sephardic men abandoned the tradition as well in the past centuries, settling for only one woman.\\nThe ads distributed in the synagogues appeared in the \"Shabbat B\\'Shabbato\" weekly bulletin. They encourage Jewish Sephardic men to return to the ancient custom, and include a quote from a halachic paper written by Rabbi Ovadia Yosef several years ago, which does not rule out the polygamy phenomenon: \"Courts imposing aggravated punishments on Sephardim over this matter are wrong.\"\\nIt\\'s unclear whether Rabbi Ovadia would still support polygamy these days, but the leaflet authors argue that according to Halacha, it is not longer forbidden among Sephardic circles today.\\nThe flyers direct their readers to the website of the \"Jewish Home\" organization, which includes quotes from a series of rabbinical religious authorities throughout history, implying that the rule forbidding polygamy has expired. The website also includes personal stories of men and women with experience in polygamy.\\nThe Srugim website revealed that the ads were funded by a group of single religious women who have given up on finding a match.\\nOne of the women, 39, said: \"I am a single religious woman who is afraid of losing the ability to become a mother.\" She added that there were 27 other women like her who would be happy to marry a married man.\\n\"Shabbat B\\'Shabbato\" editor, Rabbi Israel Rosen, expressed his reservations over the ad, explaining that ads published in the bulletin are not checked beforehand. He estimated that it was simply a joke.\\nHello rabbi, married life is not what it used to be. May I take another wife?\\n\"Of course. You can see in Rabbi Ovadia\\'s writings that it\\'s fully permitted.\"\\n\"The State laws forbid it, but from a rabbinical perspective – if the woman agrees and you are able to provide for another home – it\\'s permissible.\\nAren’t you afraid of promoting a legal offense?\\n\"If you follow the State\\'s law – fine, but you should know that the Torah law allows it.\"\\nCan the process be done secretly?\\nIs it permissible for Ashkenazim too?\\n\"I don\\'t think it’s forbidden.\"\\nAre there such couples in Israel already?\\n\"I\\'m about to take another wife, with the first one\\'s consent.\"\\nAren\\'t you afraid that what was once right isn’t right these days?\\n\"Why, is our Torah wrong?

              " 'How did the marine engine and boat segments of Brunswick Corp perform in the third quarter of 2009, in terms of net sales and operating losses? What steps is the company taking to address inventory levels and meet retail demand in 2010?: Brunswick Corp. today reported a 36 percent decline in sales for the third quarter of 2009, attributed primarily to a 40 percent drop in marine sales from year-ago levels.\\nHowever, the company also reported the lowering of inventory levels to 21 weeks of supply in the pipeline, an improved cash position up by more than $300 million from the 2008 year-end balance, and a reduction in debt.\\n\"The overall outlook, in our view, remains uncertain,\" Brunswick chairman and CEO Dustan E. McCoy said this morning in a conference call with analysts. \"Our task is to remain patient and execute well.\"\\nFor the quarter, Brunswick reported net sales of $665.8 million, down from $1.03 billion a year earlier. The company reported an operating loss of $109.4 million, which included $28.8 million of restructuring charges. In the third quarter of 2008, the company had an operating loss of $566.3 million, which included $534.2 million of impairment and restructuring charges.\\nBrunswick also reported a net loss of $114.3 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $729.1 million, or $8.26 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2008. Cash totaled $624.1 million, up from the 2008 year-end balance of $317.5 million.\\n\"We continue to make great strides in improving our overall liquidity position, reducing our marine dealer pipeline and executing our cost reduction program,\" said McCoy in a statement. \"These significant accomplishments have been achieved against a global marine market that has experienced its lowest level of demand in more than 45 years.\"\\n\"Our overall liquidity at the end of the third quarter was $740 million, $222 million higher than existed at the end of 2008. During the quarter, we retired notes maturing in 2011, which eliminates any material debt maturities over the next three years,\" he said.\\nOne of the company&apos;s top priorities this year was inventory management and implementing a pipeline reduction strategy intended to assist dealers through this difficult period. By producing fewer units than it sold at wholesale, and selling lower amounts at wholesale than dealers are retailing, Brunswick has been able to reduce the number of boats in dealer showrooms, as well as in factory yards, to extremely low levels, McCoy said.\\n\"This strategy of taking all reasonable actions to maintain the health of our dealers has thus far led to very manageable levels of dealer exits and any related Brunswick boat repurchase obligations,\" he said.\\nAnalysts had a generally positive outlook of Brunswick&apos;s third-quarter results.\\n\"We continue to applaud management&apos;s execution in what has likely been one of the worst marine downturns in history. We believe [Brunswick] is well-positioned to expand its lead ... in the industry as the recovery unfolds,\" said Tim Conder, senior analyst with Wells Fargo Securities. \"We feel that [Brunswick&apos;s] losses will materially narrow in &apos;10 versus &apos;09 and that the company will likely turn profitable in &apos;11.\"\\n\"However, the degree of both will obviously be determined by consumer&apos;s appetite for highly discretionary purchases,\" he added. \"Investors perception of this latter point will likely be the determining factor of risk appetite ... in discounting a recovery to new peak earnings power.\"\\nThe marine engine segment, consisting of the Mercury Marine Group, including the service, parts and accessories businesses, reported net sales of $363.5 million in the third quarter, down 29 percent from $515.2 million in the year-ago third quarter.\\nFor the quarter, the marine engine segment reported an operating loss of $13.4 million, including restructuring charges of $18.8 million. This compares with an operating loss of $9.7 million in the year-ago quarter, which included $18.6 million of impairment and restructuring charges.\\nSales were off across all marine engine operations, with sterndrives experiencing a greater decline than outboards.\\nThe boat segment, which comprises the Brunswick Boat Group and includes 17 boat brands, reported net sales of $118.2 million for the third quarter, down 62 percent from $314.2 million in the third quarter of 2008.\\nFor the third quarter, the boat segment reported an operating loss of $86.7 million, including restructuring charges of $6.6 million. This compares with an operating loss of $536.3 million, including impairment and restructuring charges of $491.6 million, in the third quarter of 2008.\\nBoatbuilding facilities continued to cut production and take plant furloughs during the quarter to address inventory levels held by the company and its dealers.\\nDuring this morning&apos;s conference call, McCoy noted that unit demand for most boat segments fell between 17 and 21 percent for the third quarter. This decline, he said, is lower than in the previous quarter and the same quarter of 2008.\\nBrunswick, he added, is working with closely with its dealers to examine what is needed to meet demand while not taking on more inventory than a dealer can sell. Also, Brunswick is encouraging its dealers to work together and move product around to meet demand.\\n\"It&apos;s all new for both the dealer and we,\" McCoy said this morning. \"I&apos;m confident it&apos;s going to work out well.\"\\n\"As we enter 2010, the majority of our boat and engine manufacturing facilities will begin to ramp up production. This is primarily the result of dealer inventories being at historically low levels, which means we will need to increase our wholesale shipments of boats and engines to meet retail demand. Increased production combined with higher wholesale shipments should provide improved revenue and reduced losses throughout 2010,\" McCoy said.',\n",

Nine districts and their partners formed the beginnings of what today is a vibrant field. Linked Learning is proving its relevance as federal education policy undergoes dramatic change, workforce development grows as a priority in communities, and equity becomes a north star for many decision-makers.\\nLinked Learning is effective. An evaluation by SRI Education, conducted across seven years through the District Initiative, showed that Linked Learning’s approach works for all students — and especially for students who are underperforming as they enter high school.\\nThese outcomes have attracted investment and fueled expansion of the field. The State of California has allocated more than $2 billion to advance this approach through the Career Pathways Trust and the Career Technical Education Incentive Grant. Dozens of California districts are now implementing Linked Learning in partnership with local employers, and increasingly in tandem with area colleges. Linked Learning is also taking root in six additional states as well as internationally.\\nIn early February, the Linked Learning Convention in Anaheim will gather hundreds of district and school leaders, business partners, public policymakers, researchers, and others with interest in preparing students for college and career success. I hope to see you there, and I especially look forward to talking with other funders who are active with, or considering support for, the Linked Learning field. It’s a time for all of us to reflect on the progress and lessons gained over 10 years, and to prepare for sustained expansion and quality in implementation of Linked Learning pathways.\\nThis year has featured important steps in the evolution of the Linked Learning field. As the approach spreads, commitment to its core components is crucial to improving student outcomes. That’s why the Linked Learning Alliance has launched certification and analytics platforms to support pathways everywhere. These web-based tools help ensure that the dramatic increase in Linked Learning’s scale is accompanied by a commitment to quality.\\nAccess & Equity in Linked Learning, a brief from SRI and the Alliance reporting on pathway access and academic outcomes for traditionally underserved students.\\nThe Linked Learning Advantage: 21st Century Skills Development, a brief generated by the Alliance, based on SRI student survey results, highlighting how Linked Learning is preparing students to succeed in the workplace.\\nLinked Learning and Postsecondary Transitions, a brief from SRI and the Alliance describing postsecondary outcomes — including direct college enrollment, enrollment in four-year colleges, one-year persistence in college, and persistence to a second year of college.\\nThese products draw on the comprehensive, multi-year evaluation of the California Linked Learning District Initiative conducted by SRI. We invite you to read the SRI year-seven report, and to visit the Alliance website for other resources on the effectiveness of high-quality pathways.\\nAll who are interested in the remarkable story of the field should view and share the updated Linked Learning in Motion. This interactive communication overviews progress, summarizes data on student outcomes, features voices of participants, and includes information on many other dimensions in the growth of Linked Learning.\\nThe James Irvine Foundation is an advocate for Linked Learning. We believe in this approach as a practical, powerful, and scalable education reform that can benefit all students.\\nFor that reason, we are being thoughtful about our transition from a central role in building the Linked Learning field. This transition has always been part of our strategy, and it began in earnest last year as our Foundation shifted its focus to expanding opportunity for California’s families and young adults who are working but struggling with poverty.\\nThis year and next represent continued Irvine investment in our Linked Learning partners who are steadily elevating the field’s systems of quality. This set of leaders includes ConnectEd, NAF, Center for Powerful Public Schools, SRI Education, and the Linked Learning Alliance.\\nWe salute these and other leaders in the field. In particular, we want to acknowledge the Alliance’s important, continuing role in providing governance and coordination through the Linked Learning board of directors and related panels and councils.\\nIn 2018, we will conclude our work with partners in four California regions who are advancing deeper connections that support student transitions from high school to college and career. These Regional Hubs of Excellence are making strides and building networks that will serve their young people and communities in ongoing ways.\\nAt a time when the Linked Learning approach is earning notice and wider adoption, Irvine hopes that our decade of funding and lessons learned set the stage for others to champion and propel this work to new levels. We welcome conversations with all who have interest in the future of this approach and its dynamic, diverse field.\\nAs we complete our investments in core Linked Learning infrastructure in 2018, including additional SRI research, we are pleased to share updates via this blog — and to continue collaboration with the people and organizations advancing Linked Learning. On that note, I look forward to seeing you in Anaheim!',\n",

From Nov 2013.\\nChange has swept through the way history is presented to the public. Programmes, films and books dealing with the past used to emphasise authority and accuracy as their great strengths. While those elements are still valued, argues historian and broadcaster Juliet Gardiner, the over-riding aim now has become to present an authentic view of the past. But how is that achieved? And what happens when the desire for authenticity conflicts with the facts?\\nDrawing on her role as an historical adviser on television programmes, feature films and to writers of historical fiction over the years, Juliet Gardiner shows how directors, writers and producers achieve authenticity in their work and how this affects the history we see, read and hear. She also lifts the veil on behind-the-scenes tensions and disagreements over how far the facts should be bent to achieve the precious authentic \"feel\".\\nTaking her examples from documentaries, recent movies, dramas and books as well as children\\'s programmes, Juliet Gardiner presents a lively and revealing personal essay on how the ways of presenting history have evolved - and how they have in turn shaped the way we, the public, see and think about the past.\\n\\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: How do TV producers, writers, and directors strive for authenticity when presenting historical events in their work?',\n",

              " 'Given the text: It was the season of white night in Stockholm, when sunlight bathes the city nearly 20 hours each day. The bright sky was often deceiving. Before we were aware of it, it was already nine or ten o\\'clock at night. The daylight of the northern sky--with its pristine clarity--enveloped the city and the people.\\nIn the park, sunbathers cherished every minute of the short passing summer, and a father strolled with a toddler. In a narrow alley of the Old Town, some elderly people sat around a table, chatting and laughing. Everyone in this city seemed to enjoy life and living at his or her own pace.\\nIn June 1989, I flew from England to Sweden. The capital, Stockholm, is often called the \"Venice of the North.\" It is also known as the \"City That Floats on the Water,\" and has a harbor that extends into its center. This city is built upon 14 islands linked by bridges, and is crisscrossed by canals. The water is so pristine that you can swim and fish in the middle of the city. Forests and lakes surround it, and the air is fragrant with the scent of pine trees.\\nDuring my stay in Stockholm, I made a courtesy call on Their Majesties King Carl XVI Gustav and Queen Silvia at the Royal Palace. They are a friendly, charming couple. The King is actively involved in environmental protection, and the Queen works hard for the sake of the disabled. Representing West Germany, Queen Silvia served as an official chief hostess on the Organizing Committee for the Munich Olympics in 1972, during which she met her husband, who was then Crown Prince. When their engagement was announced, they became internationally known as the \"Olympic couple.\"\\nDuring our conversation, the queen shared her first impressions of Sweden. When she arrived there, she wondered why there seemed to be so many disabled people in the city. She later realized it was not that there were more disabled people living in Sweden, but that they were integrated into society, enjoying an active public life made possible through facilities such as movie theaters and restrooms that have been specially designed to be barrier free.\\nOften referred to as normalization, such efforts were rooted in the idea that everyone--regardless of personal challenges--has a right to live a normal life with others. Based on this philosophy, Sweden has been striving to help the elderly and the physically and mentally challenged to live and participate fully in society.\\nOne day a fisherman happened upon the area and had such good luck with his catch that he forgot to start for home. As a splendid moon shone in the night sky, he noticed a multitude of black spots moving in the tide. They were a school of seals. Moments later, the seals came ashore and transformed into indescribably beautiful young maidens--the legendary sea nymphs.\\nWhile the mermaids were dancing joyfully, the fisherman hid a sealskin he found lying nearby. When it was time to return to the water, one of the mermaids could not find her sealskin and started to weep and wail. The fisherman took her to his cottage and he and his mother treated her very kindly. She seemed to be happy with them and eventually agreed to marry the fisherman.\\nEager to prove his story, the fisherman stepped ashore and brought the sealskin out from under the rock where he had hidden it. The instant his bride set eyes on the sealskin, she grasped it and drew it over her head. She then flung herself into the sea and swam quickly away. The fisherman plunged into the water after her, but could not catch her.\\nSelma Lagerlöf recounts this legend in her book The Wonderful Adventures of Nils. Though an illness had rendered her partially lame, Lagerlöf soared high on her literary wings. She once wrote: \"Merely to wish to see pretty things was not the true longing for spring. One ought to take up and kiss the first sod of grass that appeared above the snow. One should pick the first nettle-leaf merely to burn one\\'s skin because it was now spring.\"\\nThe winter of Northern Europe is long and harsh. Through it, however, the people nurture an indomitable will to wait for springtime and fully embrace it. They know that they can accomplish anything as long as they try, that they have the strength to change their lives as well as society. They shun expressions that ascribe things to fate or suggest that nothing can be done.\\nCan you summarize Selma Lagerlöf\\'s book, The Wonderful Adventures of Nils?',\n",

During our last super market trip,I got myself a packet of yeast.I looked at it lovingly and all..just hoping that it works for me too.And then I did it...thought to myself-what the heck,I'll try it once and see if it works..or else,I will never try again.I should say MBP-Cheese was really an inspiration.I had decided that if I participate,it has got to be Pizza.I hopped on to dear Shilpa's blog and saw what I really wanted to make.A guilt-free recipe for the pizza dough-base,that of whole wheat-just what the doctor ordered.I hit jackpot and went about making it.My joy knew no bounds when the dough rose-giving me a teeny weeny hope that it might work after all! !And it did..I followed the insructions carefully..and voila!! !I made my Pizza..ooh la la!! In about 1/4 cup of warm water, add sugar and salt. (Heat water for 10secs in microwave). Add the yeast, slightly give a shake to the bowl and leave it for about 5mins. Now add flour, Italian seasoning and make it into a dough (of about chapathi dough consistency). Add more water if necessary.Pour some olive oil and mix well.Cover the dough with a damp muslin cloth.Leave the dough for 10mins. The dough increases to about double the volume in this time. If the dough is of same size as you started, then there is something wrong and you might want to leave the dough in a warm place for a little more time. Drizzle a little olive oil on top. Bake it in a preheated(heated to 150C for 10mins) oven for about 5-8mins. I did not have many veggies in stock,so I just used the basic ones.Onions-Capsicum-Tomato-Mushroom.I sauteed all of it in a little olive oil,added salt to taste and crushed pepper and some more oregano. For the sauce-I used ready made Pizza sauce. A cup of mozzarella cheese. Spread the sauce on the base and spread all the veggies. Spread the grated mozzarella cheese on top. Bake in a pre-heated oven-180C till the cheese melts(approx-15 mts). I am sending this Pizza to Siri for MBP.This months theme is Cheese. MBP is a Monthly blog patrolling event started by Coffee-The spice cafe. Very Nice. Kudos for making the dough. You know you get these pizza doughs in small pouches at all grocery stores, but again i dont know about whole wheat.Good recipe ! ! Div, u will soon b addicted to the flavors! :D WOOOOOOOW...it sure looks cheeezzzzzzy! Tks for the pc! Shilpa ki recipes dont fail u! that looks so yummy..so cheesy..must have been delicious...am tempted to try it..good one!! Deepu..thank you.I am not sure Pizza dough is available to buy in India..?? Sowmya..thanks.It sure was cheesy and delicious.I am glad I tried it..you should too!! Wow youmade home made pizza, they look delicious. Nice one Divya, I also made yesterday but sometimes I use self raising flour,the dough is crisper and nice too. Hey just check water temperature for yeast(110'F),it will never die. Looks ooey-gooey and cheesy nice! woo ur pizza has come out well..looks tempting divya..\\nYummy pizza, divya. great recipe. pizza looks delicious.. nothing can get better than pizzas!\",\n",

              " 'ROI is an important marketing topic, but what should you reasonably expect?\\nYour return on investment (ROI) has the power to dictate the ultimate success (or failure) of your marketing strategy. Defined by the amount of revenue generated by your marketing activities in excess of your expenses, a campaign with a positive ROI is always worth what you invested, while a campaign with a negative ROI can eat away at your marketing budget fruitlessly.\\nThe question is, what’s a “good” ROI for your marketing campaign? And is merely being positive enough?\\nDifferent types of marketing campaigns will naturally lend themselves to different types of ROI. Take, for example, a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising campaign. Here, you’ll pay a fixed amount of money for each click you generate, and you should be able to easily calculate how many new sales you’ve generated from the campaign. It’s a one-time exchange, and a short-term one. Provided you’re targeting the right keywords and have a persuasive call-to-action (CTA), you can expect a modest ROI, and immediately after you launch the campaign.\\nBy contrast, take content marketing and search engine optimization (SEO). These campaigns are less cost-intensive to start, but you’ll be paying the costs of them on a recurring basis. In the first few months, you might not see much activity, but as you scale your efforts and accumulate more value, you’ll see better and better results—both in the form of direct traffic and onsite conversions, and in the form of higher brand awareness. Here, the end ROI is demonstrably much higher than a PPC ad campaign, but because it takes longer to generate, it’s not ideal for all companies or all goals.\\nThat said, you can generally assume that any positive ROI is good, but it’s nice to shoot for a 3:1 ratio of revenue to expenses or higher. On top of that, almost any marketing and advertising campaign results can be improved with a better understanding of your strategy, so always push for more.\\nIf you need help improving your marketing ROI, contact Quez Media for a free consultation today!

Last week, a New York judge refused to allow the studio to be entered as a defendant in a lawsuit three decades in the making.\\nThe lawsuit comes from the widow of Anthony Lazzarino, who in the early 1980s operated a company called Windwood/Glen Productions that actually held film rights to the Robert Ludlum novel. The adaptation rights were then sold to Warners\\' predecessor, Orion Pictures, in exchange for a 3.75 percent interest of revenues and a presentation credit.\\nAt the time, a movie starring Burt Reynolds as the title character was being planned. But that never happened, and in 1999, Warners allowed the rights to revert back to Ludlum, who then negotiated a deal with Universal Pictures. In 2002, the Matt Damon starrer came out and grossed more than $214 million worldwide. Three sequels were made.\\nLazzarino sued and alleged that he was due a percentage of profits and credit. Eight years after filing the claim, and after Lazzarino died last June at the age of 88, the lawsuit is still going on. But it survives in a more modest form after a judge agreed with Warners that it should not be part of the litigation.\\nWhen Lazzarino held rights, he did so with Ludlum\\'s literary agent, Henry Morrison. Together, they ran Windwood/Glen Productions until the two men had a falling out and reached a settlement with each other that gave Lazzarino sole control over Winwood.\\nAround the turn of the century, when Warners allowed the rights to revert back to Ludlum and then those rights were sold to Universal, it was Morrison who helped broker the deal, even though he was allegedly under some obligation per the settlement not to \"interfere or diminish\" Winwood\\'s rights over Bourne Identity.\\nIn 2005, Lazzarino sued the film companies as well as Morrison. He claimed that Orion had given Windwood/Glen a \"right to match\" any sale of film rights and that after Universal had come out with its film, he was contractually due a 3.75 percent interest and a presentation credit on any film \"produced or caused to be produced by Orion.\"\\nSTORY: Is Legendary\\'s New China Deal for Real?\\nIn 2008, after the original judge in the case dismissed claims against the studios but allowed a breach of contract claim against Morrison to survive, nothing happened in the case for five years. Then, suddenly, Lazzarino\\'s widow looked to revive the lawsuit and add Warner Bros. back into it.\\nNew York Supreme Court judge Marcy Friedman won\\'t allow the case to go quite so far.\\nIn her ruling last week, she concludes that the claim falls outside of the statute of limitations, pointing out that the \"claim is barred as against the Warner Bros. defendants because they executed the last agreement with Ludlum, without preserving the right to match, on May 4, 1999, more than six years before the commencement of this action.\"\\nThe judge lifts the stay as it pertains to Morrison, but because the Orion agreement only contemplated an Orion-produced film, she says, with separate remedies in the event that such a film was not made with Burt Reynolds\\' involvement, Lazzarino\\'s widow can\\'t claim a 3.75 percent interest or presentation credit from Universal\\'s blockbuster film.\\nInstead, the only claim left on the table is Lazzarino\\'s allegation that Morrison breached the settlement agreement by interfering and diminishing Winwood\\'s \"right to match\" when Orion gave up its interest in film rights. Thus, litigation over a contract made 30 years ago and the move to put Bourne Identity in Universal\\'s hands 15 years ago continues in a more modest shape.\\nWhat was the ruling of the New York Supreme Court judge regarding the claim made by Lazzarino\\'s widow against Warner Bros. and Morrison?',\n",

              " \"While a good chunk of happiness is controlled by our genes, there are lots of things we can do to make ourselves happier. There have been numerous scientific studies on happiness. Neuroscientists, in particular, have attempted to get a deeper understanding about what causes happiness. Here are four rituals to follow to create genuine happiness in our lives. According to neuroscience, gratitude affects us at a biological level. In other words, gratitude boosts the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin—the happy chemicals in our brain. Feeling grateful activates the brain stem region that produces dopamine and thinking of things we’re grateful for forces you (us) to focus on the positive aspects of our lives, increasing serotonin production in the anterior cingulate cortex. So how do we express gratitude? Try the ancient method of mindfulness. Loving-kindness meditation (aka metta meditation), in particular, is a great mindfulness technique to express gratitude. There are times when we’ll feel absolutely dreadful. Neuroscience has a simple solution for when we are feeling low. And that is to label those negative feelings. Angry? Sad? Anxious? What’s important is that we don’t try to suppress these emotions, but just label them as such and move on. In a study titled “Putting Feelings into Words,” participants viewed pictures of people with emotional facial expressions. Predictably, each participant’s amygdala activated to the emotions in the picture. But when they were asked to name the emotion, the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activated and reduced the emotional amygdala reactivity. In other words, consciously recognizing the emotions reduced their impact. Once again, this is where mindfulness meditation can help us. Labeling negative emotions is one of the fundamental principles of mindfulness. Neuroscience shows that making decisions reduces worry and anxiety and helps us solve problems. When we make a decision, our brain feels we have more control and this feeling of control reduces stress and anxiety. According to brain studies, making a decision also gives us a pleasure boost. For instance, if we are going to the gym just because we have to, it’s not really a voluntary decision. Our brain doesn’t get the pleasure boost and may even feel stress. But if we decide to go to the gym and actively choose to do our workouts, our brain gets a dopamine boost and we’ll feel happier. The quality of our relationships plays a big role in keeping us happy. So in order to boost happiness, we need to spend more time with our friends and family. Label negative feelings. Give that negative feeling a name so that our brain isn’t bothered by it anymore. Make a decision. When we make decisions, our brain feels we have more control. Hug someone. Spend more time with friends and family. Hope you enjoyed reading the article. Please share your thoughts in the comments section. Thank you so very much for sharing this and for sharing this now.

              " 'Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: Can you summarize the state of the federal budget process in Congress so far this year?\\n\\nPassage: The first year of a divided Congress got off to an inauspicious start on the federal budget, as the House and Senate both failed to approve a budget framework for 2020 before going home for a two week Easter break, continuing a less than stellar bipartisan record of action on spending and deficits on Capitol Hill in recent years.\\n\"Last year was a historically bad year for the Congressional budget process,\" said the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, noting it was the first time since 1976 that neither the House nor the Senate voted on a budget resolution.\\n\"Unfortunately, this only adds to a poor budget record,\" the group added.\\nOne important point before we get too deep into Legislative Nerd Territory - the term \\'budget\\' does not relate to actual spending, but rather to what\\'s known as the \\'budget resolution,\\' which is a budget outline - a framework - for what Congress will do later in the year, filling in the blanks with the specifics of spending choices.\\nCongress will miss the April 15 deadline to pass a budget resolution. Unfortunately, this only adds to a poor budget record https://t.co/yPevaKQKoG.\\nAs the CFRB notes, this year is not getting off to a good start on the budget, which is even more troublesome given the divided nature of Congress, with Democrats in charge of the House, and Republicans leading the Senate.\\nAnd the forecast is for a difficult budget year - which many believe might end up in another government shutdown in October, and a possible across-the-board sequester soon after.\\nHere\\'s just some of what gone on, and what to look for on Capitol Hill.\\n1. Divided House Democrats punt on 2020 budget. Just like Republicans in the House struggled for years to balance the interests of more conservative members of the Freedom Caucus and more moderate GOP lawmakers, Democrats have the same balancing act. More liberal members want to do big things in the budget. More moderate \\'Blue Dog\\' Democrats want a more middle ground on spending. And so, Democrats had to give up plans last week to vote on a bill to raise the caps on federal spending for the next two years by nearly $350 billion. Progressives didn\\'t like it because it spent too much on defense, at $733 billion. Meanwhile, some more moderate Democrats were talking about a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. The internal Democratic Party dustup was music to ears of Republicans, who chortled about the Democrats running into the Legislative Ditch.\\nYet again, @HouseDemocrats are in disarray.\\nFirst, they couldn\\'t put together a budget proposal, & now they can\\'t even gain consensus support on their backup plan.\\n2. Senate Republicans didn\\'t vote on their budget outline either. While Republicans chuckled at the failure of Democrats to force a vote on their budget plan for 2020, GOP Senators didn\\'t even try to act on their budget resolution before the April 15 deadline. The Senate GOP budget resolution would reduce future planned spending increases by over a half billion dollars, but it wouldn\\'t come close to the defense spending levels backed by President Trump - who wants $750 billion for defense. House Democrats have proposed $733 billion, while the Senate Republican budget would have funding for the military set at $643 billion, well below the President\\'s request. And so, for a second straight year, there was no budget vote-a-rama in the Senate on the non-binding budget resolution.\\nBudget apathy has reached new levels in DC. After House Dems decided to skip doing one, I asked Senate Budget Chair Enzi to comment. “Nope” he said.\\n3. The Defense Budget Gimmick used by both parties. With budget caps in place that limit how much you can spend on the military and non-defense items in the budget, Congress is still doing its best to get around those limits, especially for the military, by using an extra fund known as OCO - which stands for Overseas Contingency Operations. For example, President Trump\\'s 2020 budget would put $174 billion in the OCO fund - more money than almost all other federal agencies - in order to get to a $750 billion budget for the Pentagon. Democrats have $69 billion in OCO, with Senate Republicans at $67 billion. If there\\'s no deal on raising the budget caps, then the most money which could be spent on the Pentagon is $576 billion - unless, you get around that with the OCO $174 billion. \"OCO would be the 2nd largest federal agency, if it was an agency,\" grumbled the group Taxpayers for Common Sense, as many say it\\'s nothing but a slush fund.\\n4. McConnell, Pelosi want to negotiate a new budget deal. Even as Democrats were running aground on their effort to pass a bill which increases the spending caps, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell agreed with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to start talks on a budget agreement, as both parties know full well they need to get going now in order to have any chance of an across-the-board budget cut known as the sequester. If you look at graphic just above this bullet point, you will see the figure of $576 billion for the Pentagon, and $542 billion for non-defense spending - those are the \"spending caps\" set in law by a 2011 bipartisan budget deal. Current funding is much more than that, at $716 billion for the Pentagon and $605 billion for non-defense spending. The last three deals on the budget caps have raised the amount of spending each time - and the President may not go for that this time around.\\nHouse Democrats want to negotiate a $2 TRILLION spending increase but can’t even pass their own plan. We can’t afford it anyway, and it’s not happening!\\n5. Looming over all of this is a sequester. The reason lawmakers want to reach a \\'spending caps\\' agreement is that the Budget Act of 2011 is still on the books, and if there is no agreement on the amount of money to spend in 2020, then an across-the-board budget cut known as the \\'sequester\\' will kick in. And that would be a very big deal. If a sequester hits, the military budget would technically have go down from $716 billion to $576 billion - a cut of $140 billion. If the sequester kicks in, domestic spending would be trimmed from $605 billion to $542 billion. Ironically, because of the big increase that the GOP Congress was able to give to the Pentagon in 2017 and 2018, a sequester would hurt the military more than non-defense spending in 2020 and beyond. This is where the OCO funding (look above) comes into play - President Trump could allow the sequester to kick in, but still funnel more money to the Pentagon through that extra fund. One problem with that game plan is the GOP probably would not have 60 votes in the Senate to get that done. This may get pretty messy in the months ahead.\\nWill Trump sign another two-year budget deal like in 2018 that includes big increases for defense and non-defense? The White House is suggesting that he wont.',\n",

All of a sudden you have 125 zucchinis, 86 yellow squash, and 562 tomatoes... and it\\'s go-time. What\\'s the best thing to do with 562 tomatoes, you ask? Yup, bruschetta, baby! My hubs, Jay, grows a mean garden. I don\\'t know how he does it. It\\'s a foreign concept to me since I kill every plant in my path. He won\\'t let me near the garden. I mean, I\\'m not even allowed to water it. Plants get sick if I\\'m even near them and I swear you can hear the garden cough when I step outside. Out of everything in our garden, Jay and I both love the tomatoes the most. I mean really, is there anything that\\'s as delicious as fresh, garden tomatoes? Not too many things, that\\'s for sure! Jay grows at least five or six different kinds every year. One of the things we wait for all year long is our Garden Bruschetta. Omg, it is so delicious! We can\\'t get enough of it! We love it so much, we started a family tradition three years ago. We call it Family Bruschetta Movie Night. Family Bruschetta Movie Night happens every time we have a big batch of garden tomatoes... Which happens often, given the fact that Jay is the Garden Whisperer. So what do we do on Family Bruschetta Movie Night, you ask? Well, we make bruschetta of course! We set up a table smack dab in the middle of the living room in front of the TV, we rent a movie, we all have our own bowl of tomatoes, and then we proceed to dice tomatoes like bosses while we watch the show. It\\'s so much fun! Okay, I\\'m gonna let you in on a little secret. Shhhhh, don\\'t tell anyone. I was so damn sick of dicing tomatoes all by myself for hours on end while my family had fun all around me, I had to come up with a way to get out of it. I would dice tomatoes for what seemed like eons and then as soon as I was done, our 3,900 tomato plants spit out a new harvest. I had to find a way to get my life back. The tomatoes had stolen my life from me. My family continued frolicking in the summer sun while I was stuck at the table dicing tomatoes with pruned fingers. Eureka! That\\'s it! I will fabricate an entire evening around roping my family into helping me dice tomatoes! Omg, it was genius. Genius, I tell you! Now don\\'t get me wrong, it really is fun and it is truly a wonderful family tradition that we all look forward to, but it was created as a result of my dicing woes, hehe. My girls get so excited each and every time. Kids love doing anything different. Sometimes the littlest change or the slightest out-of-the-ordinary event gets them so tickled. They just love setting up shop in the living room. They especially love getting to use knives. Now, they are only allowed to use plastic knives or butter knives but still, they normally aren\\'t allowed even those. I mean they\\'re little kids! But under strict supervision, we let them use the dull knives. It\\'s pretty difficult to dice tomatoes with a butter knife, but they don\\'t care at all, they keep hacking away just happy to feel like \\'big\\' kids using knives. The very first time we had Family Bruschetta Movie Night, about 20 minutes in Jay looked over at me, raised his eyebrow, and whispered, \"Don\\'t think I don\\'t know what this family night is all about. I\\'m onto you.\" Whatever dude, just keep dicing! And so he has... Three years later we\\'re all still loving our Bruschetta Nights... and we\\'re all still dicing! This is a lot like the face I got when the jig was up, hehe. But enough about my dicing dupery and tomato trickery, you want the recipe, right? Go gather up your favorite kinds of tomatoes and prepare for a party in your mouth! 1. Put your diced tomatoes in a large bowl. 2. Before you add all of your ingredients to your diced tomatoes, drain the tomatoes the best you can. I use a slotted spoon and transfer the tomatoes from one bowl to another. You\\'ll be left with quite a bit of tomato juice. 3. Add all remaining ingredients to your tomatoes and stir well. After stirring, do a taste test. If desired, you can then add more seasoning or cheese depending on your own personal preference. Just keep stirring and tasting until you have it perfectly suited for you. You will have a full 14 cup container of ridiculous yumminess! *If you really want to WOW everyone, serve your delicious garden bruschetta with garlic bread made from sliced french baguette bread. You will wow party guests and picnic goers like nobody\\'s business! I promise you that people will make themselves sick by eating so much... and then thank you for it! 1. Slice your bread and put on a cookie sheet that\\'s lined with foil or parchment paper. 2. Brush each piece of bread with olive oil and then lightly season with garlic salt and parsley. People will go nuts for this stuff! You don\\'t even need to eat this bruschetta with bread to enjoy the deliciousness of it! I eat mine plain with a big spoon! My favorite way is to top my eggs with it in the mornings. There\\'s lots of ways to eat this yummy bruschetta! Just use your imagination. Imagination never tasted so good! Here\\'s some suggestions!
